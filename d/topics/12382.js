The etiology, evaluation, and treatment of speech and language disorders in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of speech and language disorders in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of speech and language disorders in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19048028\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of communication and language skills is one of the most important tasks of early childhood. It is the key to early learning and social skills.</p><p>Primary care providers will see many infants and preschool-age children whose early expressive language development and communication skills do not appear to be progressing as expected (&quot;late talkers&quot;). Receptive language delays often coexist with expressive delays but may not be suspected by the clinician or parents until the child is older. (See <a href=\"#H19048052\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19048129\" class=\"local\">'Cautions'</a> below.)</p><p>Some children with expressive language delay &quot;catch up&quot; during the preschool years (&quot;late bloomers&quot;), whereas others have persistent delay (see <a href=\"#H19048122\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> below). Early evaluation can help to correctly identify late-talking children who will benefit from intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> additional evaluation. The developmental, psychosocial, and family histories are particularly important. Most children with language delays have no associated medical or physical findings, but the absence of such findings should not delay referral for functional evaluation of suspected delay. (See <a href=\"#H19048136\" class=\"local\">'Primary care evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no universally accepted definition of &quot;delay&quot; in developmental conditions, and different definitions may be used for research and treatment purposes (see <a href=\"#H19048035\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> below). Specific program eligibility requirements should not discourage clinicians from identifying children with delays, although they may affect how information about such conditions is communicated to families. Even if the child does not qualify for services, awareness of a delay can lead to closer monitoring and provision of information to parents about ways to promote early language skills (see <a href=\"#H19048291\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below). All families of late-talking children benefit from guidance and close monitoring of their child's early communication development. The provision of appropriate supportive services and accommodations can help children with language delay achieve their full developmental and academic potential.

Absence of or delay in the development of nonverbal communication skills impacts the quality of overall communication development and can be a marker for more global delays and or atypical development, such as autism spectrum conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expressive-language-delay-late-talking-in-young-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

For research purposes, children often are considered delayed if their performance on a standardized assessment of language is at least one standard deviation (SD) below the mean for age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinical threshold for concern (ie, &quot;red flag&quot;) generally is the age at which 90 percent of typically developing children have attained a clinically predictive skill (eg, 12 months for the use of &quot;mama,&quot; &quot;dada,&quot; or &quot;papa&quot; to call a parent).

Approximately 6 to 8 percent of school-age children have specific language impairments (SLIs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expressive-language-delay-late-talking-in-young-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>These statistics indicate that a certain proportion of young children with language delay catch up during the preschool years but also that a certain proportion of school-age children with SLI were not identified before school entry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19048059\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowledge of risk factors for expressive language delay may improve surveillance and screening.</p><p>Risk factors for expressive language delay include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expressive-language-delay-late-talking-in-young-children/abstract/5,8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8-14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poverty</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low parental educational attainment (ie, parent did not graduate from high school)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low birth weight or prematurity, including late-preterm (ie, 34 to 36 weeks) and early term gestations (ie, 37 to 38 weeks)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of language delays, language disorders, or language-based learning disabilities (eg, dyslexia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male sex</p><p/><p>Boys are somewhat more likely than girls to have SLI at kindergarten entry (8 versus 6 percent of children, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expressive-language-delay-late-talking-in-young-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, conditions that are associated with language delay (eg, autism spectrum disorder [ASD], global developmental <span class=\"nowrap\">delay/intellectual</span> disability) are more common in boys than girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expressive-language-delay-late-talking-in-young-children/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-terminology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Terminology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause#H167153175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The identification of risk factors such as poverty, low parental educational attainment, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maternal depression may be helpful in addressing the global needs of the child and family, as well as the need for enrichment of the early learning environment (eg, through early intervention services).

It is important to consider both aspects because they may have implications for treatment and eligibility for services. Community and educational programs, such as early intervention or special education, provide services based upon a child's developmental level or degree of delay (see <a href=\"#H19048035\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above). They also provide services to children who have certain diagnoses (eg, Down syndrome, ASD, etc).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19048073\"><span class=\"h2\">Developmental and behavioral conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developmental and behavioral conditions that involve expressive language delay are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71932\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71932 \">table 2</a>). These diagnoses are made on the basis of patterns of delay or behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19048080\"><span class=\"h2\">Other diagnoses and contributing factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large number of medical, neurologic, metabolic, genetic, and environmental conditions can cause or contribute to early language delays, particularly in the context of a more global developmental condition. Selected conditions that may cause or contribute to early expressive language delay are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50911\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50911 \">table 3</a>). For most children with isolated expressive language delays, a specific etiology beyond socioeconomic risk factors, maturational issues, or family history may not be found.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19048087\"><span class=\"h2\">Invalid explanations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should be wary of the rationalizations listed below as explanations for language delay in a young child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expressive-language-delay-late-talking-in-young-children/abstract/4,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18,19</a>]. Further evaluation or referral should not be delayed on the basis of these rationalizations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&quot;He's a boy, and boys talk later than girls.&quot;</strong> A variant of this rationalization is: <strong>&quot;His father and uncle didn't talk until they turned three, and they turned out fine.&quot;</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This rationalization is invalid because speech and language milestones develop at a similar rate in boys and girls before three years of age. Boys actually are at increased risk for developmental conditions associated with language delays compared with girls, given the higher prevalence of ASD and global <span class=\"nowrap\">delays/cognitive</span> impairments in males. Male family members with early language delays might have benefited from evaluation and intervention if they had been available at the time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&quot;She's growing up in a bilingual home.&quot;</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bilingual exposure and confusion about language generally does not explain a frank delay in language development in early childhood. When assessing the language skills of children who are exposed to two languages, clinicians should ask about the child's most complex skills in both languages. The amount and quality of exposure to each language may affect the rate of skill acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expressive-language-delay-late-talking-in-young-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The absence of a drive to communicate and engage others is a red flag for developmental delays <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conditions involving impairment in reciprocal social interaction (eg, ASD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Impaired social communication and interaction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&quot;He's not saying much, but he understands everything.&quot;</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While this may indeed be the case, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for a receptive language delay in young children with expressive language delays.

Children with selective mutism speak only in familiar settings, often only with a few close family members. Although overall language development may be normal, children with selective mutism are difficult to assess. They require <span class=\"nowrap\">intervention/therapy</span> to address anxiety, which impacts their social-emotional and overall development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course#H343722605\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and course&quot;, section on 'Selective mutism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-for-anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a child with selective mutism is spending a significant part of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> day not speaking (eg, in a child care program or in school), the child may also be at risk for developing an expressive language delay due to limited language practice.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19048094\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with expressive language delay may present with delayed language milestones, drooling, or behavioral problems.</p><p>Normal language milestones are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58598\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58598 \">table 4</a>).

Parents may not recognize their child's language delay but generally are keenly aware of temper tantrums and other behavioral self-regulation difficulties. For this reason, the language development of toddlers and preschool children whose parents raise behavioral concerns should be monitored closely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19048122\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant percentage (as many as 60 percent) of children with isolated early expressive language delays appear to spontaneously &quot;catch up&quot; in their language milestones between age two and three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/expressive-language-delay-late-talking-in-young-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Receptive language delay may not be suspected by the clinician (or parent). Primary care clinicians may not objectively screen for receptive language skills, which are difficult to assess subjectively.
