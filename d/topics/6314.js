T2DM and its comorbidities are risk factors for vascular disease later in life. As a result, it is imperative for health care providers to identify and treat children and adolescents with this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition; epidemiology; and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis of T2DM in children and adolescents are presented here.

The presence of insulin resistance explains the strong clinical association of T2DM with obesity and other insulin-resistant states, as discussed below. Impaired insulin secretion has been demonstrated in a variety of studies, which show that both adolescents and adults usually have lost about 80 percent of their pancreatic beta cell function before the diagnosis of T2DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In most cases, the pancreatic dysfunction does not appear to be mediated by antibodies against the pancreatic islet cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.) </p><p>By contrast, the primary characteristic of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is absolute insulin deficiency, and the insulin deficiency usually is caused by T-cell mediated immune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, marked by the presence of pancreatic autoantibodies. Insulin resistance may be present to a variable degree, particularly in association with the epidemic of childhood overweight and obesity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite these apparent differences, there is considerable overlap between the two disorders regarding both insulin resistance and presence of pancreatic autoantibodies. Therefore, distinguishing between the disorders is challenging and not always possible. (See <a href=\"#H11216221\" class=\"local\">'Type 2 versus type 1 diabetes'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is occurring worldwide in parallel with an increasing prevalence of obesity in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

As an example, in a retrospective study from Cincinnati, the incidence of T2DM in youth rose 10-fold from 0.7 cases per 100,000 in 1982 to 7.2 cases per 100,000 in 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A large representative dataset from the SEARCH Study for Diabetes in Youth reported that the unadjusted incidence rate rose from 9.0 cases per 100,000 in 2002-2003 to 12.5 cases per 100,000 in 2011-2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The adjusted relative annual increase of T2DM of 4.8 percent was highly significant (p&lt;0.001). The SEARCH Study also reported that the prevalence of T2DM in youth increased by 30.5 percent (95% CI 17.3-45.1) between 2001 and 2009, after adjustment for case ascertainment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p>Incidence rates vary markedly among different racial and ethnic groups. In the SEARCH study cited above, incidence rates in 2012 were 3.9 per 100,000 for non-Hispanic whites; 32.6 per 100,000 for non-Hispanic blacks; 18.2 per 100,000 for Hispanics; 12.2 per 100,000 for <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islanders, and 46.5 per 100,000 for Native Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The greatest adjusted annual increases were among <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islanders (8.5 percent) and Native Americans (8.9 percent), although there were significant increases in incidence rates from 2002-2003 through 2011-2012 among all groups except for non-Hispanic whites. Prevalence rates of T2DM in 2009 were 0.46 per 1000 individuals 10 to 19 years (0.17 per 1000 for non-Hispanic whites; 1.06 per 1000 for non-Hispanic blacks; 0.79 per 1000 for Hispanics; 0.34 per 1000 for <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islanders, and 1.2 per 1000 for American Indians) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95197\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95197 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This represents a 30.5 percent (95% CI 17.3-45.1) adjusted increase in the overall prevalence of T2DM between 2001 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Increases were evident in both sexes, across all age-groups 10 to 19 years old, and in white, Hispanic, and black youth. </p><p>Previously, data suggested that the overall incidence of T2DM in adolescents had not increased as sharply as the increases in obesity in the same age group. The rates of childhood obesity have stabilized at about 17 percent across the years 2003-2004 through 2011-2014, but rates of severe obesity continue to increase, reaching 9.1 percent among adolescents in 2013-2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There remains a mismatch between the rates of childhood obesity and T2DM, probably because of a substantial latency period between the onset of obesity and the related risk for T2DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Consistent with this model, studies have shown sharp increases in T2DM among young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, the rates of obesity among adolescents may cause a modest increase in T2DM among adolescents, and a more substantial increase in T2DM when the cohort reaches adulthood. The observed increased prevalence of T2DM in the United States may be the result of changing demographics with increases in racial and ethnic minority groups that experience higher rates of T2DM than non-Hispanic white youth, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ongoing increases in the prevalence or severity of obesity in some parts of the population. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following factors are associated with an increased risk for childhood onset T2DM:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive family history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific racial and ethnic groups</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions associated with insulin resistance</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excess adipose tissue and obesity are the most important risk factors for T2DM.

As an example, in a registry study from the United States, nearly 80 percent of youth with T2DM were obese, and an additional 10 percent were overweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Obesity predisposes to T2DM by increasing peripheral resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The role of obesity in the pathogenesis of T2DM is discussed separately in greater detail. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Role of diet, obesity, and inflammation'</a>.)</p><p>As in adults, the risk for T2DM in adolescents is associated with an abdominal fat distribution (also called central adiposity, visceral, android, or male-type obesity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

The intent of the intervention was to reduce the frequency of overweight and obesity, and thus reduce the risk of T2DM. The school-based program did not yield a greater decrease in the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity compared with control schools. However, the intervention did reduce fasting insulin levels, BMI Z-score and several other measures of adiposity, particularly among youth who were overweight or obese at study entry. These findings have potential implications for&nbsp;reducing the risk of childhood-onset T2DM, but also demonstrate the difficulty of achieving meaningful improvements in <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obesity</span> status. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in adults suggest that T2DM is caused by a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors in a susceptible individual. In the majority of patients with T2DM, genetic susceptibility appears to be due to the expression of multiple genes (polygenic).

As an example, in studies in the United States, 50 to 90 percent of youth diagnosed with T2DM have acanthosis nigricans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,81</a>].

Patients with T1DM are somewhat more likely to present with ketoacidosis due to severe insulin deficiency, but this presentation occurs in 5 to 10 percent of adolescents with T2DM. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diabetic ketoacidosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pancreatic autoantibodies &ndash; In situations where it is unclear what form of diabetes the patient has, we recommend obtaining pancreatic (islet) autoantibodies. We test for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and anti-tyrosine phosphatase (IA2) antibodies, as well as anti-insulin (IAA) antibodies if insulin replacement therapy has not yet been initiated or has been used for less than two weeks. Testing for a beta cell-specific autoantibody to zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) is also valuable, but is not yet widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. If present, these autoantibodies support the diagnosis of T1DM. Up to 10 percent of adolescents with phenotypically diagnosed T2DM will have evidence of beta cell autoimmunity, supporting the value of antibody testing to help distinguish between the two types of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insulin and C-peptide levels &ndash; A C-peptide level <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> a serum insulin level if insulin therapy has not yet been initiated) obtained after glycemic control has been established may also provide clinically useful information. Low C-peptide levels support a diagnosis of T1DM, but should be interpreted with caution because they can also be low at the time of diagnosis of T2DM. </p><p/><p>Some patients may have mixed features and are difficult to classify. Patients with clinically diagnosed T2DM may have atypical characteristics, including a presentation with ketosis (&quot;ketosis-prone T2DM&quot;) or ketoacidosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of pancreatic autoantibodies. For example, among 1206 youths clinically diagnosed with T2DM and screened for participation in the TODAY study, 9.8 percent were found to have positive antibodies to either GAD or IA2 (other antibodies were not tested) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>], findings that suggest islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, fasting serum insulin and C-peptide levels have not been standardized to distinguish between type 1 and 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. Thus, the pathophysiologic features of both types of diabetes may coexist in the same patient, particularly if the patient has obesity. </p><p>The challenges of categorizing types of diabetes were illustrated in a multicenter study in which pediatric diabetes was classified based upon the presence or absence of beta cell autoimmunity and the presence or absence of insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. More than 70 percent of patients fell into traditional categories of autoimmune and insulin sensitive T1DM (55 percent), or nonautoimmune and insulin resistant T2DM (16 percent). An additional 20 percent had both autoimmunity and insulin resistance, a pattern typical for obese patients with T1DM. The remaining 10 percent of patients were insulin sensitive in the absence of pancreatic autoimmunity, most of whom were clinically categorized as T1DM (ie, type 1B diabetes), and the remainder as T2DM. In these instances, evaluation for other forms of diabetes (eg, maturity onset diabetes of the young [MODY]) should be considered, as discussed in the next section. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Distinguishing type 1 from type 2 diabetes'</a> and <a href=\"#H11216228\" class=\"local\">'Other causes of diabetes'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11216228\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes of diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T2DM is differentiated from other causes of diabetes by patient characteristics, history, and laboratory studies.

Several different genetic abnormalities have been identified, each leading to a different type of disease. The diagnosis of MODY is made by performing diagnostic genetic testing by direct sequencing of the gene. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MODY should be considered in a patient presenting with non-insulin dependent diabetes at a young age (&lt;25 years), with autosomal dominant transmission and lack of pancreatic autoantibodies. As an example, one study found that approximately 8 percent of patients found to be autoantibody-negative and C-peptide-positive had MODY mutations, resulting in a prevalence of 1.2 percent for MODY-positivity in the pediatric diabetes population (including only <em>HNF1A </em>[MODY3], <em>HNF4A</em> [MODY1], and <em>glucokinase </em>[MODY2] genes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In a separate study involving 808 youth under 20 years of age with diabetes from the United Kingdom, 2.5 percent had monogenic diabetes and 3.3 percent had type 2 diabetes. These authors identified the need to genotype based upon C-peptide positivity and islet autoantibody negativity. The criteria for diagnosing type 2 diabetes were BMI &ge;85<sup>th</sup> percentile, absence of monogenic or secondary diabetes, C-peptide positivity, and islet autoantibody negativity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].
