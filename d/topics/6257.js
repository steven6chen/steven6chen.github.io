This was illustrated in a population-based study of children who were younger than 18 years of age from a single county in Minnesota that reported a yearly increase in the incidence of nephrolithiasis over a 25-year period from 1984 to 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The age-gender adjusted pediatric nephrolithiasis rate rose from 7.2 to 14.5 per 100,000 person-years between the two time periods of 1984 to 1990 and 2003 to 2008. In this study, it remains uncertain whether there was a true increase in the risk of pediatric nephrolithiasis or if there was improvement in making the diagnosis of stone disease with the use of computerized tomography.</p><p>In a study analyzing Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) data from 41 freestanding United States (US) pediatric hospitals from 2002 to 2007, the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis was made in one case for every 685 pediatric hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Another report based on the PHIS data demonstrated that the proportion of hospitalizations due to pediatric nephrolithiasis rose from 18.4 per 100,000 admissions in 1999 to 57 per 100,000 in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This trend is similar to the increased incidence in adult nephrolithiasis, which is thought to be due to changes in dietary habits (eg, increased intake of animal protein and sodium) and increased prevalence of obesity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1394592363\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of nephrolithiasis is lower in children than in adults. As an example, in a population-based study from the US of patients over 10 years of age, adolescents between 10 and 19 years of age accounted for only 4 percent of the total episodes of nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For the total population, the incidence of nephrolithiasis was 109 per 100,000 men per year and 36 per 100,000 women per year. The explanation for the lower pediatric incidence is unknown, but may be due in part to the higher concentrations of crystal formation inhibitors such as citrate and magnesium in the urine of children compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>In the population-based study from Minnesota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the increase in the incidence of pediatric nephrolithiasis was mainly due to an increased risk of stones in adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age (13 versus 36 per 100,000 person-years between the two time periods). In this cohort of 297 children with nephrolithiasis, the mean age was 13.2 years, and 40 percent had a family history of stone disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369377009\"><span class=\"h2\">Gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children do not have the strong male gender predominance as seen in adults with nephrolithiasis.

Boys were more commonly affected in the first decade of life and girls in the second decade. This gender variation may reflect that boys are more likely to have obstructive urinary malformations resulting in nephrolithiasis that typically presents early, whereas there is an increase in the rate of urinary tract infections, another risk factor for renal stones, in postpubertal sexually active girls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1394592467\"><span class=\"h2\">Race/ethnicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies have demonstrated that nephrolithiasis is more common in Caucasian children and occurs rarely in African American children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/2,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1394592402\"><span class=\"h2\">Geography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to adult nephrolithiasis, the incidence of renal stones in children varies worldwide, with the highest incidence occurring in endemic areas, such as in Turkey and Thailand.

Infection may be the primary cause of a stone or occur concomitantly with a underlying urinary metabolic abnormality or structural abnormality.</p><p>Functional or anatomic obstruction of the urinary tract predisposes children to stasis and infection, which promote stone formation. Because boys are more likely to have obstructive uropathy, 80 percent of children with stones associated with infections are male. Infection-associated stones are usually detected before five years of age. All races are equally affected. Improvements in the detection and repair of obstructive uropathy have reduced the incidence of stones due to infections.</p><p>Bacteria that produce the enzyme urease are strongly associated with pediatric nephrolithiasis and include Proteus, Providencia, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and enterococci. Urease breaks down urea to form ammonium and bicarbonate, which creates a favorable biochemical milieu for the formation of struvite stones (magnesium ammonium phosphate). Struvite stones, which can contain carbonate apatite, tend to branch, enlarge, and often fill the renal calyces, producing a &quot;staghorn&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F62009\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62009 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F72669\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72669 \">image 2</a>).
