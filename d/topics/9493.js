Clinicians are often asked to predict outcome after stroke by the patient, family, other healthcare workers, and insurance providers. A wide variety of factors influence stroke prognosis, including age, stroke severity, stroke mechanism, infarct location, comorbid conditions, clinical findings, and related complications. In addition, interventions such as thrombolysis, stroke unit care, and rehabilitation can play a major role in the outcome of ischemic stroke. Knowledge of the important factors that affect prognosis is necessary for the clinician to make a reasonable prediction for individual patients, to provide a rational approach to patient management, and to help patient and family understand the course of the disease.</p><p>This topic will review the factors that affect stroke prognosis, with a focus on the acute phase of ischemic stroke. The prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-treatment-and-prognosis#H8754524\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126911394\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR PREDICTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the acute phase of stroke, the strongest predictors of outcome are stroke severity and patient age. Stroke severity can be judged clinically, based upon the degree of neurologic impairment (eg, altered mentation, language, behavior, visual field deficit, motor deficit) and the size and location of the infarction on neuroimaging with MRI or CT. Other important influences on stroke outcome include ischemic stroke mechanism, comorbid conditions, epidemiologic factors, and complications of stroke. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H981723846\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of stroke on neurologic exam is probably the most important factor affecting short- and long-term outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/1-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-14</a>]. As a general rule, large strokes with severe initial clinical deficits have poor outcomes compared with smaller strokes. </p><p>Neurologic impairment is measured quantitatively in many research studies, and increasingly in clinical practice, by use of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which measures neurologic impairment using a 15-item scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61698 \">table 1</a>) or less often by use of the Canadian Neurological Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55644 \">table 2</a>). As an example, the combination of neurologic findings in patients with a large infarction involving the middle cerebral artery vascular territory typically includes forced gaze deviation, visual field deficit, hemiplegia, and aphasia or neglect, depending on the hemisphere involved, and yields a NIHSS score &gt;15 for a right hemisphere infarction and &gt;20 for a left hemisphere infarction.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that the NIHSS is a good predictor of stroke outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/2,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15-17</a>]. One report analyzed NIHSS scores obtained within 24 hours of acute ischemic stroke symptom onset from over 1200 patients enrolled in a clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Each additional point on the NIHSS decreased the odds of an excellent outcome at three months by 17 percent. At three months, the proportion of patients with excellent outcomes for NIHSS scores of 7 to 10 and 11 to 15 was approximately 46 and 23 percent, respectively. An NIHSS score of &le;6 predicted a good recovery (able to live independently, whether or not able to return to work or school), while a score &ge;16 was associated with a high probability of death or severe disability. In many such studies, descriptors such as &quot;good recovery&quot; are based upon discharge location to home or independence in activities of daily living such as mobility. However, the NIHSS does not evaluate more complex goals such as return to prior level of employment, participation in leisure activities, or social participation. In general, recovery of these areas is less than those measured by the NIHSS.</p><p>The relationship of NIHSS score with final outcome varies according to the time elapsed from stroke onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>], in part because early stroke-related deficits tend to be unstable, and because many patients experience gradual recovery. Thus, the NIHSS score associated with a specific disability outcome shifts to lower values over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One study found that the best predictor of poor prognosis at 24 hours was an NIHSS of &gt;22, and the best predictor at 7 to 10 days was an NIHSS score of &gt;16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, the correlation of the NIHSS score with final disability outcome increases with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The Canadian Neurological Scale (CNS) is also useful for predicting outcome after acute ischemic stroke. A CNS score of &lt;6.5 on admission is associated with increased 30-day mortality and a poor outcome at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Although comparative data are limited, the results of one study suggest that the NIHSS is more accurate than the CNS for predicting outcome at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>An important limitation of both the NIHSS and the CNS scales is that they do not capture all stroke-related impairments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-and-utility-of-stroke-scales-and-grading-systems#H24273522\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use and utility of stroke scales and grading systems&quot;, section on 'Stroke impairment scales'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H863643597\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advancing age has a major negative impact on stroke morbidity, mortality, and long-term outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/1,5,7,10,12,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,7,10,12,19-23</a>]. The influence of age in stroke outcome is seen in both minor and major strokes. Older adults (over 65 years) have increased chance of dying in two months after stroke and being discharged to the skilled nursing facility if they survive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Advancing age is used in several predictive models. (See <a href=\"#H863642780\" class=\"local\">'Global prognostic scales'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H981723878\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on neuroimaging including stroke size and location are an important adjunct to the neurologic exam when gauging prognosis. Early after stroke, the neurologic exam alone can suggest a falsely grim or favorable prognosis. For example, a patient may have a small stroke on neuroimaging and present with stupor or coma caused by seizure or metabolic derangement that is reversible. Conversely, a patient presenting with mild stroke and a low NIHSS score on examination may have large vessel occlusion and a large perfusion deficit on neuroimaging, suggesting the possibility of stroke progression and worse outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H863643955\"><span class=\"h3\">Infarct volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of acute infarction on neuroimaging studies may be used to estimate stroke outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In one small study, the volume of ischemic tissue determined by diffusion-weighted MRI within 36 hours of stroke onset combined with the NIHSS score and time from stroke onset to imaging predicted the functional outcome at three months better than any of the individual factors alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A much larger study analyzed data from over 1800 patients who had CT or MRI within 72 hours of ischemic stroke onset and found that initial infarct volume was an independent predictor of stroke outcome at 90 days, along with age and NIHSS score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In these and most other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/8,11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,26</a>], the vast majority of infarcts analyzed were supratentorial (eg, anterior circulation, middle cerebral artery territory) and the results may not apply to posterior circulation or infratentorial infarcts, in which an infarct of small volume can result in severe disability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H216555\"><span class=\"h3\">Infarct location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis for stroke recovery may vary by the affected vascular territory and site of ischemic brain injury.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], basilar artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], or a large intracranial artery is associated with an increased risk of poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. It follows that involvement of total anterior circulation or posterior circulation also portends poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/18,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,33-35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strokes in the insular region (supplied by the insular branch of the middle cerebral artery) have been associated with increased mortality, which is often attributed to autonomic dysregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. However, this association may be confounded by infarct size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Insular infarcts may undergo early expansion due to associated large vessel occlusion and progression of infarction in surrounding areas of initially viable but ischemic brain tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior choroidal artery infarctions may be more likely to progress in the first few days after stroke than other subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

In a prospective report of patients with arm disability, the maximum degree of functional recovery was reached within three weeks from stroke onset by 80 percent of patients, and within nine weeks by 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Complete functional arm recovery was achieved by patients with initial mild and severe arm paresis in 79 and 18 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The return of arm and hand function after stroke is particularly important to a good functional recovery. The flexor synergy seen after stroke limits the ability to isolate joint movements, so the ability to extend the fingers and release grasp is a significant component of a good motor outcome. Several studies have found that early active finger extension, grasp release, shoulder shrug, shoulder abduction, and active range of motion are associated with a favorable prognosis for arm and hand recovery at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/110-113\" class=\"abstract_t\">110-113</a>]. As an example, in a prospective cohort study of 188 patients with monoparesis or hemiparesis from anterior circulation ischemic stroke observed, patients with some voluntary finger extension and shoulder abduction of the hemiplegic limb on day 2 after stroke onset had a high probability (0.98) to regain some dexterity by six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].

Not surprisingly, the prognosis for full recovery is greatest when patients have milder degrees of aphasia at onset. The time course for recovery from aphasia is similar to that of motor function. One prospective study included over 300 patients with aphasia at admission; the time to maximal language recovery in 95 percent of patients with initially mild, moderate, and severe aphasia was 2, 6, and 10 weeks, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].

This level of function is a useful benchmark because most patients with a Barthel Index score &ge;60 are able to walk with assistance and contribute to their activities of daily living; in addition, the likelihood of a supported discharge to the community rises substantially.
