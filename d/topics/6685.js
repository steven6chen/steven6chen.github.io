Bone involvement can also be extensive in patients with multiple myeloma, and bone may be a primary or secondary site of disease involvement in patients with lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-lymphoma-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary lymphoma of bone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with advanced malignancy, bone metastases represent a prominent source of morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Skeletal-related events (SREs) due to bone metastases include pain, pathologic fracture, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression. Across a wide variety of tumors with bone involvement, the frequency of SREs can be reduced through use of osteoclast inhibitors such as bisphosphonates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>.

In some cases, the extent of bone destruction is such that a fracture is imminent but not complete (termed an impending fracture). Pathologic fractures can be secondary to a benign lesion (eg, Paget disease, giant cell tumor of bone, hemangioma) or a malignant tumor, which may be a primary bone tumor (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, lymphoma) or metastatic carcinoma, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma. The goals of treatment, regardless of underlying etiology, are to minimize morbidity and maximize function and skeletal integrity. For most patients with a completed or impending pathologic fracture of a long bone, this will necessitate surgical fixation.

An overview of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for bone metastases in general, issues related to pathologic fractures in Paget disease and in patients with a primary bone tumor such as osteosarcoma, and the use of radiation therapy for the management of painful bone metastases without a pathologic fracture are discussed elsewhere.

Among visceral cancers, breast, prostate, lung, thyroid, and kidney cancer account for 80 percent of all skeletal metastases, but many other primary malignant tumors can spread to bone including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, uterine leiomyosarcoma, and hepatocellular and uterine carcinomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis#H2002100094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of adult patients with bone metastasis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Pathologic fractures are frequent in patients with bone metastases, developing in 9 to 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pathologic fracture rates appear to be highest among patients with multiple myeloma, in which the pattern of bone metastases is purely lytic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54124 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In multiple myeloma, lytic bone disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78569\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78569 \">image 1</a>) is created by osteoclast activation, but also osteoblast inhibition, which prevents fracture healing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Osteolytic bone lesions'</a>.)</p><p>Pathologic fractures develop less often in those with osteoblastic (as typified by prostate cancer) as compared with osteolytic metastases (as typified by myeloma or renal cell carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83214\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83214 \">image 2</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

When the fracture involves the lower extremity, the patient is often suddenly rendered nonambulatory. A pathologic fracture should always be considered when patients with known bone metastases or a history of cancer develop the sudden onset of pain even in the absence of deformity or inability to ambulate. This is particularly true in the upper extremity and spine, where pain may be the only manifestation. In many cases, pain or discomfort precedes the actual fracture itself, and this is another clue to the presence of a true pathologic fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Pathologic fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine typically present with pain on axial load, such as sitting or standing. Counter-intuitively, other pathologic spine fractures, particularly at the thoracolumbar junction, may present with pain in recumbency. The patient will report sleeping in a recliner for several weeks as the genesis of the pain is an unstable kyphosis. Cervical spine pathologic fractures present with pain on flexion and extension of the neck. Additionally, at the atlanto-axial junction, patients will experience severe rotational pain and may have radiating pain to the occiput suggestive of occipital neuralgia.</p><p>Pain from a pathologic fracture must be distinguished from the much more common &quot;biologic pain syndrome&quot; in cancer patients with bone metastases. The term &quot;biologic pain&quot; refers to pain that occurs in the night or early morning and that resolves over the course of the day. This pain does not denote fracture or instability, but rather the diurnal variation in endogenous steroid secretion from the adrenal gland. With decreased steroid secretion at night, patients with bone metastases may experience pain, occasionally severe, from inflammatory mediators that are secreted by the tumor, and this may resolve with increased activity (causing release of endogenous steroids) or exogenous steroid administration. While pain of this type denotes the presence of tumor in bone, it is not reflective of a fracture.</p><p>Neurologic symptoms are not uncommon in patients with a pathologic vertebral compression fracture. Typically, the deficits, such as weakness, numbness, and tingling, result from soft tissue tumor compressing the spinal cord or cauda equina rather than the pathologic fracture itself. Epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) is a devastating complication of metastatic bone disease involving the spine. It is defined as a mass lesion caused by tumor extension into the epidural space or a pathologic spine fracture with displacing bone into the spinal cord. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a fracture of the pelvis may present with pain that radiates into the buttock; tumors of the pelvis may compress or invade the sciatic nerve causing true sciatica. A fracture in the scapula may present with numbness, tingling, and loss of function in the ipsilateral arm. A summary of presenting clinical features of pathologic fractures is presented in the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90393\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90393 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>Pathologic fractures also typically occur with minimal trauma, much less than would typically be required to break an unaffected bone, and this is another clue to the presence of a pathologic fracture. In general, the force needed to cause a pathologic fracture in a benign bone lesion is greater than that needed in a primary or metastatic bone tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Common sites of long bone pathologic fracture include the femur, tibia, and humerus. Within the long bones, the femur is the most commonly affected site, with most cases affecting the proximal femur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of proximal femoral pathologic fractures are located in the femoral neck, 30 percent are subtrochanteric, and 20 percent intertrochanteric (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90460 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Patients with a history of cancer may present with a single bone lesion, oligometastatic disease, multiple bone metastases, or visceral plus bone metastases. Not infrequently, a pathologic fracture is the presenting sign of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This occurs most commonly with lung carcinoma followed by renal cell carcinoma, as these are cancers that may not manifest initially with symptoms related to the primary site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199716734\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1148502511\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a complete or impending pathologic fracture should undergo a thorough and systematic assessment prior to fixation. The evaluation process should allow delineation of the osseous and soft tissue extent of the lesion and its relationship to adjacent structures, establish the diagnosis of the index lesion, determine overall skeletal involvement of the tumor, detect any other metastases that may require concomitant treatment, and provide an estimate of the patient's overall prognosis. In addition, although the majority of patients with a complete or impending pathologic fracture have an established diagnosis of cancer, a systematic and detailed workup to identify the primary site is required for patients who present with metastatic bone disease without an established diagnosis of cancer. (See <a href=\"#H199716728\" class=\"local\">'Patients with a remote or no history of cancer'</a> below.)</p><p>A complete and comprehensive medical history should include prior smoking history that might predispose to lung, renal, and bladder cancers as well as any personal history of cancer, the current oncologic status, and related treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The patient should be asked about sensory and motor dysfunction, walking ability, and urinary retention or overflow incontinence, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bowel incontinence or constipation. The physical examination should include the principal symptomatic area as well as other symptomatic sites, focusing on the extent of soft tissue tumor extension and its relationship to the neurovascular bundle of the extremity, the neurovascular status of the affected extremity, the presence of limb edema, muscle strength, and the range of motion of the affected joint(s). Assessment of the anal sphincter is mandatory for patients with spinal metastases, as is examination of the bladder for evidence of urinary retention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Special attention should be paid to examining potential primary sites (breast, thyroid, prostate) if there is only a remote or no history of cancer. Moreover, the general medical condition of the patient and fitness for operative intervention must be assessed, underscoring the need for a comprehensive physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H199716728\" class=\"local\">'Patients with a remote or no history of cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H892749078\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a complete or impending pathologic fracture is usually established radiographically. Tissue diagnosis may not be needed preoperatively for patients with a pathologic fracture and a previous histologic diagnosis of metastatic bone disease or radiographic evidence of multiple bone lesions. However, in a patient with a solitary bone lesion with or without a history of cancer, every attempt should be made to secure a diagnosis prior to fixation. Among patients age 40 and older presenting with radiographically aggressive-appearing bone lesions, metastatic carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis, followed by multiple myeloma and lymphoma, with primary bone sarcomas being distinctly less likely. However, the possibility of sarcoma has to be kept foremost in consideration until a tissue diagnosis is established, because the surgical treatment for primary sarcomas is different than that for metastatic tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H543915102\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiographic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A plain biplanar radiograph of the entire involved bone from the joint proximal to the joint distal is the initial diagnostic test for evaluation of bone pain to assess bone structure, integrity, extent of tumor involvement, presence of pathologic fracture or risk of impending fracture, and to identify less obvious areas of involvement that may affect decision making regarding operative intervention. Complete radiographs of the entire affected long bone should be scrutinized for other lesions that warrant prophylactic stabilization. (See <a href=\"#H1148505276\" class=\"local\">'General surgical principles'</a> below.)</p><p>The typical radiographic appearance of a metastasis is a lytic, permeative lesion of the diaphysis or metadiaphysis of a proximal long bone or bone of the axial skeleton (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F93404\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93404 \">image 3</a>). It may be difficult to distinguish vertebral collapse related to tumor from osteoporotic vertebral collapse.</p><p>Plain radiographs can also detect osteoblastic lesions, which appear sclerotic, sometimes admixed with lytic elements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86427\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86427 \">image 4</a>). In either case, a fracture line may be visible, and the normal anatomic alignment may be displaced (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83214\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83214 \">image 2</a>). Compression fractures in vertebral bodies lead to a collapse of the endplates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83026\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83026 \">image 5</a>).</p><p>In general, plain radiographs are more specific but less sensitive than bone scintigraphy or positron emission tomography (PET) scanning for bone metastases and pathologic fractures. It is estimated that close to 10 percent of pathologic fractures are not confidently detected by plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One exception is that plain radiographs are more sensitive than radionuclide scintigraphy for purely lytic metastases (eg, multiple myeloma, some renal cell metastases). Bone scans detect osteoblastic activity resulting in new bone formation. Thus, bone lesions associated with multiple myeloma are only &quot;hot&quot; on bone scan in approximately 20 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H628348693\"><span class=\"h4\">Cross-sectional imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation with cross-sectional imaging may be required for the evaluation of metastatic bone disease involving the shoulder, spine, or pelvis because of the complex anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are usually done as part of the initial workup of adults with aggressive bone lesions suspected to represent possible metastatic disease to search for primary carcinomas, and in patients with known metastatic disease to assess overall disease load and estimate overall prognosis.</p><p>For evaluation of the bone lesion in the shoulder, spine, pelvis and other sites, CT scans are highly accurate for determining the integrity of the bone cortex, and this can aid in the diagnosis of a pathologic fracture and in the assessment of fracture risk using newer technology such as CT-based structural rigidity analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H199714550\" class=\"local\">'Assessing the risk of fracture'</a> below.)</p><p>The character of underlying bone marrow patterns of destruction can also be ascertained, along with evidence of a soft tissue mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83026\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83026 \">image 5</a>). </p><p>MRI is both more sensitive and more specific than CT and is a preferred technique for the identification of bone metastases and other primary bone tumors. However, there is little need for an MRI of every bone lesion in the adult population where metastatic carcinoma, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma is more likely than a primary bone sarcoma. CT is easier, faster, and more comfortable for the patient, and may be better than MRI in evaluating cortical destruction. (See <a href=\"#H628349007\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>However, MRI is a more sensitive technique than CT for the detection of underlying bone marrow lesions at a fracture site (ie, if the diagnosis of a pathologic versus insufficiency fracture is in doubt) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The most sensitive discriminating feature is that of a well-defined low signal T1-weighted abnormality around the fracture, indicating an underlying tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is particularly relevant in the spine and pelvis, both common locations for both insufficiency fractures and metastatic disease. In one study of 24 patients with nontraumatic spontaneous vertebral compression fractures, who underwent MRI followed by whole body integrated PET-CT and followed by fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology to confirm the lesion, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for malignant lesions were 90 and 79 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Should the lesion prove to be a primary mesenchymal malignancy (eg, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma), the surgical repair could jeopardize not only the opportunity for limb salvage, but also the possibility of cure. Although there are no published data that indicate how often a solitary lesion of the bone in a patient with a history of cancer is a nonmetastatic solitary primary bone tumor, orthopedic oncologists estimate that this occurs 10 to 20 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. On the other hand, preoperative tissue diagnosis may not be needed for patients with a pathologic fracture and a previous histologic diagnosis of metastatic bone disease or radiographic evidence of multiple bone lesions. If a patient has a history of cancer without prior documentation of bone metastases and a confirmatory diagnosis of metastatic disease is all that is required, needle biopsy can be an excellent method to acquire enough tissue simply to document the presence of metastatic disease. CT-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) is easy to perform and accurate in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

If the patient is taken to the operating room without an established diagnosis of metastatic disease, multiple myeloma, or lymphoma, it is imperative that a separate incisional biopsy be done of the bone lesion itself and that the surgeon waits until the pathologist examining the frozen section provides a definitive diagnosis prior to proceeding with any intervention. No instrumentation should be introduced into the intramedullary canal (including a guide rod for an intramedullary nail) before the diagnosis is established. Obtaining reamings to establish the diagnosis of an unknown lesion is contraindicated, as this unnecessarily violates uninvolved areas of the bone and surrounding soft tissues that can severely compromise the ability to care for a sarcoma if that is the ultimate diagnosis.

After providing the CTRA results, surgeons changed their operative plan in 36 patients.

The superior ability of FEM for fracture prediction compared with the Mirels' score was shown in an analysis of 33 patients with metastatic femoral lesions, of whom 28 completed four months of follow-up without fracture and five went on to fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. There were three modeled experimental loading cases that simulated activities of daily living: axial compression (AC), level walking (LW), and aggressive stair ascent (ASA). Although sensitivity (ability to predict fracture) was similar for FEM and the Mirels' criteria specificity (the ability to correctly predict the non-fracture cases) was better for FEM under the AC and LW loading conditions (71 and 86 percent, respectively, for FEM compared with 43 percent for Mirels), it was poorer for the ASA (21 percent) conditions.

In most instances, the procedure of choice is a complex total hip arthroplasty, which is indicated with or without a fracture.

There has been no widely accepted definition of what constitutes an unstable spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Older approaches to defining spinal instability relied mainly on clinical features (ie, a diagnosis of spinal instability can be made clinically if the patient has pain on motion that is not present at rest) with support from diagnostic imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>].</p><p>A novel classification system for spinal instability in neoplastic disease was developed based upon the available evidence and expert consensus opinion consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Systematic reviews of the literature to identify the best evidence for clinical, radiographic, and pathologic factors that relate to neoplastic spinal instability in the cervical and thoracolumbar spine served as the framework to guide an expert consensus from the Spine Oncology Study Group, an international group of 30 spine oncology experts from around the world. Six individual components of spinal instability were scored, with a final Spine Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) representing a composite score of the individual components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80396\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80396 \">table 4</a>). According to this classification, patients with a score of 7 or higher are considered to be at risk for spinal instability and warrant surgical consultation.</p><p>While the published evidence was considered in deriving the SINS, this classification system is not evidence based and it reflects broad expert opinion of spinal neurosurgeons. Nevertheless, it represents a contemporary consensus approach to defining spinal instability. Regardless of the radiographic findings, the clinician should consider every patient with pain caused by movement to be unstable until proven otherwise.

When the underlying lesion associated with the fracture is aggressive in appearance, the differential diagnosis is limited to metastatic carcinoma, plasma cell dyscrasia (myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma), lymphoma, and bone sarcoma.</p><p>Radiographic imaging may assist in the differential diagnosis. In one series, compared with pathologic fractures caused by metastatic bone tumors (including multiple myeloma), fractures caused by a primary bone sarcoma had a higher incidence of lytic destruction of the bone cortex, mineralization and a soft tissue mass on plain radiographs and CT scans, and a periosteal abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Taken together, all of these features had a high negative predictive value (with their absence highly suggestive of a metastatic cancer rather than primary bone sarcoma). However, the absence of these features might also point towards a benign bone lesion as well.</p><p>Insufficiency fractures are a type of stress fracture that occur in metabolically weakened bone (ie, prior radiation therapy, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, Paget disease of bone). Distinguishing them from a pathologic fracture due to metastatic disease or myeloma can pose significant diagnostic dilemmas, given that they may share imaging features on plain radiography. Additional cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT) or MRI as well as technetium-99 (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) bone scintigraphy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can help in narrowing the differential.</p><p>As an example, in one report, PET scan was useful at discriminating between acute benign and malignant fractures; the maximal Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) was significantly lower with benign as compared with malignant cases (1.36 &plusmn; 0.49 versus 4.46 &plusmn; 2.12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In another review of patients who underwent 18-FDG-PET (positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose) within six weeks of spine needle biopsy, the mean SUV was 7.1 for malignant tumors compared with 2.1 for benign lesions (p &lt;0.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. PET was a significantly better predictor of malignancy in nonsclerotic bone lesions.

Complete and impending pathologic fractures should be treated with durable fixation or reconstruction that will outlast the patient's expected survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Although the expected survival time is short in some cases (especially with lung and colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]), survival may be prolonged in other diseases, particularly with multiple myeloma, and breast, prostate, or renal cell cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/73-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-77</a>]. Prediction of survival in the setting of bony metastatic disease has become increasingly refined, and predictive tools have been developed for specific settings of both extremity and spinal metastatic bone disease. Utilization of these nomograms and algorithms is of use in predicting survival when a complex reconstruction requiring longer recovery is being considered. This subject is discussed further below. (See <a href=\"#H1148505683\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications to surgical management'</a> below.) </p><p>Because of the possibility that survival may be prolonged, fixation should not rely upon healing of the fracture to achieve stability, and it should allow the patient full use or at least full weight-bearing immediately postoperatively. Liberal use of cement should be considered as an adjunct to internal fixation in order to achieve these goals. For long bone fractures, consideration should always be given to abandoning internal fixation in favor of resection of diseased bone and endoprosthetic reconstruction when internal fixation will not accomplish the aforementioned goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Other lesions in the vicinity (the bone in which the fracture has occurred as well as adjacent and distant bones) may impact operative planning. Identification of these lesions warrants consideration of usage of intramedullary devices over plate fixation and of longer-stem endoprostheses over standard length stems. Involvement of the acetabulum in a patient with a femur fracture may be better treated with a total hip reconstruction rather than a hemiarthroplasty. Similarly, periacetabular lesions in a patient being considered for total hip arthroplasty might necessitate extending the fixation into the supra-acetabular bone with screws, cement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acetabular cage constructs. Hence, complete radiographs of the entire affected long bone should be scrutinized for other lesions that warrant prophylactic stabilization. (See <a href=\"#H543915102\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1065841369\" class=\"local\">'Controversies'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with metastatic cancer are known to be at increased risk for venous thromboembolic disease, and this risk is amplified in orthopedic patients undergoing intramedullary nailing for metastatic bone lesions, despite current anticoagulation protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In this multi-institutional series of 287 patients with 336 actual or impending fractures, the overall rate of venous thromboembolism was 7.1 percent, including a pulmonary embolism rate of 3.9 percent and a deep vein thrombosis rate of 3.3 percent. The authors concluded that current means of anti-venous thromboembolism prophylaxis may be inadequate, and recommended that anticoagulation not be avoided for most patients for unjustified concerns over bleeding issues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk and prevention of venous thromboembolism in adults with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, treatment of an impending pathologic fracture is less complicated than treatment of an actual fracture. Furthermore, elective fixation prevents the intense pain and loss of function associated with a pathologic fracture. Therefore, a goal of managing patients with bone metastases is prophylactic surgical fixation of identified bones that are at risk of developing a pathologic fracture before they actually fracture. There are guidelines to help identify patients at risk for a fracture.

In general, patients should have an estimated survival duration that is equal to or greater than the time needed to recover from the procedure. For procedures such as intramedullary nailing, plate fixation of a long bone fracture, or a straightforward hip or shoulder hemiarthroplasty, this time is around six weeks or less, but for more complicated procedures, such as complex acetabular reconstructions, this may entail a recovery period of three to six months.</p><p>Models to predict prognosis that are based upon the number of skeletal metastases, presence of organ metastases, primary site, hemoglobin level, and performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57945 \">table 6</a>) have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/79-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-93</a>], several of which are specific to spine metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/79-83,86-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-83,86-93</a>].

However, for intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric impending fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90460 \">picture 1</a>) and pathologic fractures, numerous series report high success rates for both arthroplasty and internal fixation.

A multi-institutional prospective randomized study comparing internal fixation with arthroplasty for proximal femoral metastatic lesions in the United States has been funded by the Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation, but is not yet open for enrollment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-stem versus standard length femoral arthroplasty</strong> &ndash; One of the general principles in the surgical care of patients with metastatic carcinoma is to try to protect the entire involved bone when possible. However, the decision to do so, particularly in the femur, has been associated with potential adverse outcomes. Embolic phenomena (oxygen desaturation, hypotension, and pulmonary emboli) potentially leading to prolonged intubation, coma, cardiac arrest, and even death are reported in association with use of longer arthroplasty devices in patients with metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/113-117\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-117</a>]. This has been predominantly demonstrated with long-stem cemented femoral arthroplasty devices, although there are reports of similar problems occurring rarely with unilateral or bilateral femoral nailings in this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the data are limited, the incidence of disease progression in the distal femur does not appear to be sufficiently high to warrant routine use of longer devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>]. As an example, in a series of 96 patients with metastases, myeloma, or lymphoma of the bone who had undergone stabilization or arthroplasty for impending or actual femoral or humeral pathologic fractures using an approach that favored long intramedullary implants and long-stem arthroplasty where possible, the risk of progression apart from the originally identified lesion (1 in 96) was markedly lower than the complication rate (12 of 96, all potentially attributable to embolic phenomena) of the long stem placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. Thus, routine use of long devices is not warranted for most patients. However, when distal lesions are identified, they should be addressed in some fashion in order to avoid subsequent fractures distal to the implant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cephalomedullary versus standard femoral nail fixation for diaphyseal lesions</strong> &ndash; As a corollary to the question posed regarding the need to protect the distal femur, others have evaluated whether proximal cephalomedullary nail devices are needed to protect the femoral neck for femoral diaphyseal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Among the 145 femoral nailings performed for femoral diaphyseal disease in this series, none (0 percent) subsequently developed femoral neck metastases. The authors concluded that, for femoral diaphyseal disease alone, cephalomedullary devices are unnecessary for treatment of either pathologic fractures or impending fractures due to metastatic carcinoma, myeloma, or lymphoma. However, they conceded that their series was relatively small, and a stronger recommendation to avoid cephalomedullary nailing in these cases awaits confirmation from other large centers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cemented versus press-fit femoral arthroplasty</strong> &ndash; Traditional recommendations in patients with metastatic disease undergoing arthroplasty are for use of a cemented femoral device, as it affords immediate stability without the need for delayed weight bearing or dependence upon bone ingrowth for stability. However, as noted previously, cemented arthroplasties, particularly those with long stems, have been associated with embolic phenomenon that can lead to catastrophic complications. Further, with the evolution of arthroplasty care, many clinicians also mobilize patients with noncemented arthroplasties without restricted weight bearing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our view, cemented femoral components remain the standard of care for metastatic disease in most orthopedic oncology practices. There are no published reports on the use of these noncemented arthroplasties in this patient population, and the potential exists for early loosening due to lack of bone ingrowth either from local tumor effects, irradiation, or the combination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Open versus closed approach for intramedullary nailing</strong> &ndash; There are two general schools of thought relative to intramedullary nailing for long bone pathologic fracture and prophylactic fixation. One advocates an open approach to the fracture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lesion, thorough curettage of the tumor mass, and open cementing of the defect around or through the fixation device. Those advocating this approach cite improved local control with disease debulking and better strength with a cemented defect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An alternative approach is closed reaming and nailing without approaching the lesion directly. Advocates of this approach suggest less blood loss, shorter operative time, and less general morbidity of the procedure when the lesion is not approached directly. There are no published reports directly comparing these two approaches. An intermediate approach is to limit the application of an open procedure to those patients requiring an open biopsy with frozen section at the time of fixation or for patients with very large or poorly radio-responsive lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plate versus rod versus segmental defect replacement fixation for the humeral diaphysis</strong> &ndash; Although intramedullary stabilization is typically used for long bone fixation in patients with metastatic disease, the humeral diaphysis uniquely lends itself to the alternatives of plate fixation or intercalary prosthetic replacement using a segmental defect device. Although humeral intramedullary stabilization may generally be done either with or without bone cement (as discussed above), for plate fixation and segmental defect devices, cement is recommended. Advantages of intramedullary stabilization include the potential for a closed approach with protection of a generally larger percentage of the length of the bone, biomechanically superior fixation over plating for impending pathologic fractures, and a lower complication rate in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/122-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">122-124</a>]. Advantages of the plating technique include the potential to combine an open approach with direct application of the fixation device, biomechanical superiority over intramedullary nailing when the pathologic fracture has occurred, and avoidance of rotator cuff irritation sometimes seen with nails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/125,126\" class=\"abstract_t\">125,126</a>]. The third alternative, the cemented segmental defect device, is more costly than either intramedullary fixation or plating, but has some biomechanical advantages over intramedullary nailing in complete and impending pathologic fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/127-132\" class=\"abstract_t\">127-132</a>]. In a series of these devices implanted in multiple anatomic sites from 2008 to 2013, 18 humeral implants did not result in any complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. However, based on a 57 percent complication rate in femoral intercalary modular devices overall, higher in noncemented implants, cement fixation is recommended at this site.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122959073\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT is recommended for most patients after fixation of a complete or impending pathologic fracture. The rationale for RT includes promotion of remineralization and bone healing, alleviation of pain, improved functional status, and reduction in the risk for subsequent fracture or loss of fixation by treating residual metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/134,135\" class=\"abstract_t\">134,135</a>]. More recent reports underscore the importance of postoperative RT, even in the current setting of routine treatment with an osteoclast inhibitor for metastatic disease, as this approach alone diminishes the risk of a skeletal-related event (fracture, pain) but does not appear to prevent disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].

Outcomes at 35 sites receiving postoperative RT were compared with 29 sites that were treated with surgery alone. On multivariate analysis, postoperative RT was the only factor that predicted good functional status (defined as normal use either pain free or with pain), which was achieved by 53 percent of irradiated patients compared with 12 percent of patients treated with surgery alone. Second orthopedic procedures were also more common in patients treated initially with surgery alone, and median survival was significantly improved for the cohort of patients treated with surgery plus RT. Given the retrospective nature of the study and the potential for selection bias, outcomes must be interpreted cautiously.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 192 patients treated surgically for 228 metastatic lesions of the long bones, 60 percent of the patients received preoperative or postoperative RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. The reoperation rate in irradiated fracture sites was not significantly different as compared with nonirradiated sites (13 versus 10 percent). However, five of the six patients who required surgery for local tumor progression had not received RT. On the other hand, 8 of 10 nonunions and all five patients who developed a postoperative stress fracture had been treated with RT. Given that stress fracture and nonunion are less of a problem with endoprostheses, the authors concluded that skeletal complications after RT may be circumvented by the use of endoprostheses.</p><p/><p>Despite the paucity of data regarding benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>], we and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/139-142\" class=\"abstract_t\">139-142</a>] suggest that RT be given after stabilization surgery for patients with a pathologic fracture. The entire surgical field must be treated. Postoperative treatment is generally started within two to four weeks of surgery, typically after the wound has adequately healed. A fractionation scheme of 30 Gy in 10 fractions is recommended given the lack of experience with single-fraction RT in the postoperative setting.

For some tibial and more distal lower-extremity fractures, patellar-tendon bearing braces may be provided, although the tibia is also amenable to internal fixation with either intramedullary or plate fixation, depending upon the specific anatomic location.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RT may provide good palliation of pain, but is unlikely to permit full use or weight bearing on the extremity, particularly if the femur is affected.

It is defined as a mass lesion caused by tumor extension into the epidural space or a pathological spine fracture with displacement of the cord. It may present as a surgical emergency with rapidly evolving neurologic deficit or with slowly progressive neurologic dysfunction and pain. A landmark randomized trial demonstrated that for patients with ESCC, a good performance status, and a life expectancy of at least three months, direct decompressive surgery followed by postoperative RT was superior to treatment with RT alone both in terms of preserving ambulation in those initially able to walk and for regaining ambulation for initially nonambulatory patients. A more detailed description of this trial and the role of surgical management of patients with epidural spinal cord compression are covered in detail elsewhere.

A decision framework that is based upon neurologic (extent of cord compression, presence or absence of myelopathy), oncologic (radiosensitivity of the malignancy, prior irradiation), mechanical (presence of spinal instability), and systemic factors (able to tolerate surgery) has been developed to assist in the decision-making process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>].</p><p>The integration of postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) rather than conventional fractional external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has been evaluated in select centers with experienced multidisciplinary teams. With the integration of effective SRS, the concept of simple &quot;separation surgery&quot; has evolved in which the epidural tumor is resected using a posterior approach, and screw-rod fixation is placed, without an attempt to gross-totally resect the vertebral body or paraspinal tumor. The benefits of this approach can be illustrated by a retrospective study of 186 patients operated via separation surgery followed by SRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. Overall, 77 percent had radioresistant tumor histologies and 49 percent failed prior RT and progressed to high-grade spinal cord compression. The one-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 16.4 percent, but patients who were treated with high-dose hypofractionated (8 to 10 Gy x 3) or high single-fraction (24 Gy) RT had low recurrence rates, 4.1 and 9 percent, respectively.

(See <a href=\"#H199714550\" class=\"local\">'Assessing the risk of fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mirels' scoring system represents a good initial estimate of fracture risk for metastases involving long bones, but it should be tempered by clinical judgment and experience until more accurate techniques are established and widely available. Prophylactic stabilization should be considered for all lesions with significant functionally limiting pain that is exacerbated by weight bearing. Patients who have failed radiation therapy (RT) and have ongoing pain are often candidates for prophylactic fixation regardless of their Mirels' score. (See <a href=\"#H199714557\" class=\"local\">'Mirels' scoring system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with spine metastases, an important component of the evaluation is an assessment of spine stability. The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS), which is based upon radiographic appearance and pain, represents a contemporary consensus approach to defining spinal instability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80396\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80396 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. However, every patient with movement-related or axial-load pain should be considered to have an unstable spine until proven otherwise. Mechanical instability pain combined with radiographic correlates as delineated by the SINS scoring system is critical in determining whether an intervention is needed to address a patient's pain. (See <a href=\"#H1065839347\" class=\"local\">'Assessing spinal stability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a complete or impending pathologic fracture is usually established radiographically. A plain biplanar radiograph of the entire bone is needed to assess for other lesions that may warrant prophylactic stabilization. (See <a href=\"#H543915102\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cross-sectional imaging may be needed to establish the integrity of the bone cortex. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are effective, but CT is probably the imaging method of choice for most patients when metastatic disease is highly likely. However, MRI will better delineate the extent of tumors within the bone, the associated soft tissue extension, and the presence of skip metastases. MRI is particularly useful for patients with spine metastases to allow evaluation of the extent of medullary and extraspinal disease, and spinal cord and nerve root compression. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The extent of skeletal involvement should be assessed using technetium-99 (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) bone scintigraphy, radiographic skeletal survey (for multiple myeloma), or positron emission tomography (PET) scan. (See <a href=\"#H628348933\" class=\"local\">'Whole body skeletal evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H628349007\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main differential diagnosis for a pathologic fracture caused by metastatic cancer or myeloma includes benign insufficiency fracture and primary bone tumor (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma of bone [previously termed malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone], plasmacytoma, primary lymphoma of bone). (See <a href=\"#H628349007\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a complete or impending pathologic fracture, preoperative evaluation and staging must be thorough and systematic. The goals are to delineate the osseous and soft tissue extent of the lesion and its relationship to adjacent structures, determine the overall skeletal involvement by tumor, detect any other metastases that may require concomitant treatment, and assess the patient's overall prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H1148502511\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An impending or complete pathologic fracture in a patient with a solitary bone lesion, with or without a history of cancer, should never be fixed without a tissue diagnosis. If a patient has a history of cancer without prior documentation of bone metastases and a confirmatory diagnosis of metastatic disease is all that is required, CT-guided fine needle aspiration or core biopsy should be undertaken to document the presence of metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H472135267\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the majority of patients have an established diagnosis of cancer, a pathologic fracture may be the presenting sign of cancer. In such cases, a systematic and detailed workup is required to establish the primary site and stage the extent of disease spread before operative fixation is attempted. (See <a href=\"#H199716728\" class=\"local\">'Patients with a remote or no history of cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of treatment for a complete or impending pathologic fracture are to palliate pain, minimize morbidity, and maximize function and skeletal integrity for the duration of the patient's remaining life span. For most patients with a pathologic fracture or impending fracture of a long bone, this will necessitate surgical fixation. (See <a href=\"#H1148505276\" class=\"local\">'General surgical principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For complete or impending pathologic fractures of the long bones, three operative strategies are commonly used, each of which features a different implant: endoprosthetic reconstruction, intramedullary nailing, and <span class=\"nowrap\">plate/screw</span> fixation devices. The choice of procedure must be individualized to the anatomic site and extent of tumor destruction. However, for the femur, the two primary choices should be endoprosthetic reconstruction and intramedullary nailing. (See <a href=\"#H199714233\" class=\"local\">'Long bones'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operations are rarely required for complete or impending pathologic fractures of the pelvis, other than for those involving the acetabulum. (See <a href=\"#H628350235\" class=\"local\">'Pelvis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical consultation should be sought for patients with bony compression of the spinal cord or vertebral column instability. However, multidisciplinary evaluation is necessary to determine the optimal approach for spine metastases with compression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic compromise. Operative treatment may be indicated for patients with symptomatic vertebral body fractures that are causing instability or epidural spinal cord compression. (See <a href=\"#H122959216\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic spine tumors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1065839347\" class=\"local\">'Assessing spinal stability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The decision to pursue RT in lieu of stabilization will depend on the extent and nature of the bony metastases, overall disease burden, the performance status and life expectancy of the patient, associated symptoms, and tumor histology. (See <a href=\"#H609534652\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy as alternative to surgical decompression for ESCC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"nowrap\">Vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty</span> is generally reserved for patients with symptomatic spinal metastases without epidural disease or retropulsion of bone fragments into the spinal cord. (See <a href=\"#H122959216\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic spine tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest RT for most patients after fixation of a complete or impending pathologic fracture of any bone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Fractionated RT should generally be administered as there is little experience using single-fraction RT in these situations. (See <a href=\"#H122959073\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative radiation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H122959271\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most consistent result of operative intervention for a complete or impending pathologic fracture is alleviation of pain, which occurs in the majority of patients. Most series report an ability to walk or good to excellent function in &gt;50 percent of patients. For patients with spine metastases, functional outcomes (especially the ability to ambulate posttreatment) are highly dependent on neurologic status prior to treatment. Reoperation for local tumor progression or failure of fixation is required in less than 10 percent of patients who are treated with operative intervention followed by RT.
