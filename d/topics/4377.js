In the United States, it is estimated that 25 percent of adults over the age of 60 have lost all their teeth (edentulism), approximately one-half from periodontal disease and one-half from dental caries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>In addition to producing pain and discomfort, odontogenic infections can extend beyond natural barriers and result in potentially life-threatening complications, such as infections of the deep fascial spaces of the head and neck. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Periodontal infection can also be associated with a number of systemic disorders. These include fever of unknown origin, bacteremic seeding of heart valves and prosthetic devices, preterm birth of low birth weight children, and an increased risk for coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular events. </p><p>The complications, diagnosis, and treatment of odontogenic infections will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of these infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of odontogenic infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gingivitis and periodontitis in adults: Classification and dental treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suppurative odontogenic infections may extend to potential fascial spaces in the orofacial area (orofacial space infections) or deep in the head and neck (peripharyngeal space infections). The latter complication is often life threatening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, odontogenic infections may spread contiguously to cause osteomyelitis of the jaw or hematogenously to produce systemic illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Orofacial space infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Superficial orofacial space infections can involve the buccal, submental, masticator, canine, and infratemporal spaces. The location of the space infection can assist in recognizing the underlying infected tooth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71760 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>If unrecognized and untreated, these infections are potentially serious since they can spread contiguously into the deeper fascial spaces of the head and neck, such as the submandibular, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal spaces, or into the carotid sheath. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The spread of infection into the deeper fascial spaces of the head and neck is suggested by the finding of trismus (the inability to open the jaw). Trismus indicates pressure or infection of the muscles of mastication (the masseter and the pterygoids) or involvement of the motor branch of the trigeminal nerve. Such infections can spread intracranially to cause purulent meningitis or subdural empyema and caudally to result in aspiration, airway obstruction, or fatal necrotizing mediastinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Buccal and submental spaces</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections arising from mandibular or maxillary bicuspid and molar teeth tend to extend in a lateral or buccal direction. The relation of the root apices to the origins of the buccinator muscle determines whether infection will exit intraorally into the buccal vestibule or extraorally into the buccal space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77988\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77988 \">figure 1</a>). Infection of the buccal space is readily diagnosed because of marked cheek swelling with minimal trismus and systemic symptoms.</p><p>Involvement of a mandibular incisor can perforate below the mentalis muscle and present as a submental space infection. The chin appears grossly swollen and is firm and erythematous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Masticator spaces</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Masticator spaces consist of the masseteric, pterygoid, and temporal spaces, all of which are well differentiated but intercommunicate with each other as well as with the buccal, submandibular, and lateral pharyngeal spaces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80359 \">figure 2</a>). Infection of the masticator spaces arises most frequently from molar teeth, particularly the third molars (wisdom teeth). The clinical hallmark of masticator space infection is trismus and pain in the area of the body or ramus of the mandible.</p><p>Swelling may not be a prominent finding, especially in the masseteric compartment, since the infection is beneath large muscle masses that can obscure or prevent clinically apparent swelling. When present, swelling tends to be brawny and indurated, suggesting the possibility of cervicofacial actinomycosis or mandibular osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervicofacial-actinomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervicofacial actinomycosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infection of the deep temporal space usually originates from involvement of the posterior maxillary molar teeth. Little external swelling is observed early in the course; if present, it usually affects the preauricular region and an area over the zygomatic arch. As infection progresses, the cheek, eyelids, and whole side of the face may be involved. Infection may extend directly into the orbit via the inferior orbital fissure and produce proptosis, optic neuritis, and abducens nerve palsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Canine and infratemporal spaces</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involvement of the maxillary incisors and canines may result in a canine space infection, which manifests as dramatic swelling of the upper lip, canine fossa, and frequently the periorbital tissues. Pain is usually moderate, and systemic signs are minimal. Occasionally, direct extension of infection into the adjoining antrum leads to purulent maxillary sinusitis.</p><p>The infratemporal space is bounded medially by the lateral plate of the pterygoid process and the pharynx, posteriorly by the parotid gland, anteriorly by the maxilla, and superiorly by the roof of the infratemporal fossa, adjacent to which is the inferior orbital fissure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80359 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Primary infections of the infratemporal fossa usually originate from involvement of the posterior maxillary molar teeth, particularly the third molar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Injection of local anesthetic into this area for a dental restoration may predispose to infection.</p><p>Clinically, marked trismus and pain are present but very little swelling is observed early in the course. Late manifestations are similar to those of temporal space infections, including extension into the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure. In addition, if the infection extends internally, it can involve an area close to the lateral pharyngeal wall, resulting in dysphagia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteomyelitis of the jaw</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Odontogenic infections can spread contiguously to cause osteomyelitis of the jaw. The mandible is much more susceptible to osteomyelitis than the maxilla, primarily because the cortical plates of the former are thin and vascular supply to the medullary tissues is relatively poor. Despite this, osteomyelitis secondary to odontogenic infection is relatively uncommon. When it does occur, there is usually a predisposing condition, such as compound fracture, irradiation, diabetes mellitus, or steroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>With initiation of infection, the intramedullary pressure markedly increases, further compromising blood supply and leading to bone necrosis. Pus travels through the Haversian and perforating canals, accumulates beneath the periosteum, and elevates it from the cortex. If pus continues to accumulate, the periosteum is eventually penetrated, and mucosal or cutaneous abscesses and fistulae can develop. Areas at greatest risk of perforation in the mandible are the lingual aspect in the region of molar teeth and anteriorly on the buccal aspect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>As the inflammatory process becomes more chronic, granulation tissue is formed. Spicules of necrotic and nonviable bone may become either totally isolated (sequestrum) or encased in a sheath of new bone (involucrum).</p><p>Severe mandibular pain is a common symptom of jaw osteomyelitis and can be accompanied by anesthesia or hypoesthesia on the affected side. In protracted cases, mandibular trismus may develop.</p><p>A clinical variant of osteomyelitis of the jaw is Garre's chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis or proliferative periostitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This entity usually occurs in children and young adults following a periapical infection of the mandibular first molar. It is a nonsuppurative form of osteomyelitis characterized by a localized, hard, nontender swelling over the mandible. On radiographic imaging, the newly formed periosteal bone appears as layers outside the cortex, giving a characteristic &quot;onion skin&quot; appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Actinomycosis and radiation necrosis are two common causes of this form of osteomyelitis of the jaw [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p>A related clinical entity, characterized by exposed necrotic bone in the maxillofacial region, is osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with long-term administration of bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis or cancer. The prevalence of this condition appears to have escalated, particularly among older female patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This is discussed in detail separately.

Although bacteremia can occur following almost all types of dental manipulations, including flossing, scaling, even tooth brushing and chewing hard candy, such episodes are usually transient and inconsequential in healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In contrast, the bacteremia in patients with dental caries and periodontal disease tends to be more frequent and sustained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and is a potentially important cause of infective endocarditis in elderly patients, who may be more susceptible due to age-related degenerative or calcified valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-and-microbiology-of-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, and microbiology of infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dental sources of bacteremia in elderly adults are of increasing concern for those undergoing prosthetic heart valve implantation or prosthetic joint replacement. It has been recommended that routine dental assessment be performed in all patients undergoing valve surgery and that appropriate therapeutic interventions be initiated whenever possible before valve implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The relevant data and possible mechanisms are discussed separately.

In addition, imaging techniques to assess the extent of involvement are essential.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Specimen collection and processing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the difficulties in defining etiologic agents for odontogenic infections is the presence of normal resident oral flora. For closed space infections, it is imperative that the normal oral flora be excluded during specimen collection in order to interpret culture results. Needle aspiration of loculated pus by an extraoral approach is desirable, and specimens should be transported immediately to the laboratory under anaerobic conditions.</p><p>However, contamination by the resident oral flora is inevitable for intraoral lesions. In this setting, direct microscopic examination of stained smears often provides more useful information than culture results from surface swabs. Gram stain and acid-fast stains for bacteria and potassium hydroxide preparations for fungi should be routinely performed on these specimens. Tissue biopsies should be routinely examined for histopathologic evidence of acute or chronic inflammation and infection. Specific microbial agents, including certain bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections, can sometimes be detected by immunofluorescence or polymerase chain reaction.</p><p>Patients with chronic osteomyelitis often have soft tissue swelling and draining fistulas. Aspirates from the adjacent soft tissue swelling may be valuable. In contrast, cultures from sinus tracts can be misleading, since there is communication with the external environment. Thus, microorganisms that are isolated could represent colonization of the sinus tract rather than the organism responsible for the infected bone. Bone biopsies for histopathology and culture are often required for definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of imaging technique varies with the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A panoramic or periapical radiograph may reveal the extent of advanced periodontitis or the presence of periapical abscess.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) is particularly sensitive for osseous structures and remains the imaging modality of choice for assessment of most odontogenic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Dental amalgam used in fillings may cause metallic streaking artifact on CT and obscure the region of interest. This problem can be minimized with multidetector CT imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT and particularly magnetic resonance (MR) have become the preferred imaging modalities for the localization of deep fascial space infections of the head and neck. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections#H988692187\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lateral radiograph of the neck may demonstrate compression or deviation of the tracheal air column, or the presence of gas within necrotic soft tissues. In retropharyngeal infections, lateral radiography of the cervical spine or CT scanning can help determine if the infection is in the retropharyngeal space or the prevertebral space. The former suggests an odontogenic source, while the latter suggests involvement of the cervical spine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technetium bone scanning, used in combination with gallium or indium-labeled white blood cell scanning, is particularly useful for the diagnosis of acute or chronic osteomyelitis and for the differentiation of infection or trauma from malignancy. In acute osteomyelitis, both the bone scan and gallium scan are likely to be positive. In chronic osteomyelitis, the technetium scans may or may not be positive, while gallium or indium-labeled scans are often negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Similarly, bone neoplasms can be associated with a positive technetium scan but negative gallium or indium scan. Although the scintigraphic findings may be suggestive, only bone biopsy will definitively differentiate infection from malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-imaging-modalities-in-the-setting-of-suspected-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to imaging modalities in the setting of suspected osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meticulous attention to oral hygiene is the most important strategy for effective control of supragingival and subgingival plaque that, in turn, is essential for both caries prevention and the treatment of periodontitis. Individuals with physical or mental limitations who cannot adequately perform oral hygiene by themselves should receive daily oral hygiene by care providers. More frequent visits to dentists and use of electric toothbrushes should also be considered in these patients. Regular check-ups and prompt restorative care by dental professionals should be actively promoted.</p><p>With the recognition of the microbial specificity of odontogenic infections, topical antiseptics and systemic antibiotics have played an increasingly important role in the control and treatment of both dental caries and periodontal disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77718 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of odontogenic infections&quot;, section on 'Microbial specificity in odontogenic infections'</a>.)</p><p>The need for dental extractions has been reduced considerably by the availability of improved dental restorative materials, such as bonding and fluoride-releasing agents, as well as improved restorative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Dental caries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caries management with restorative therapy (eg, fillings) is the preferred therapeutic approach in many countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, restorative therapy must be combined with preventive measures, since restorations have relatively short durability and new caries may form at the margins of restorations if the causes of the disease persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>].

The early and dominant symptom of acute pulpitis is a severe toothache that can be elicited by thermal changes, especially cold drinks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of odontogenic infections&quot;, section on 'Pulpitis and periapical abscess'</a>.)</p><p>Pulpitis can be classified as reversible or irreversible. Reversible pulpitis occurs when caries encroach on the pulp and is associated with mild inflammation of the pulp. Irreversible pulpitis refers to ongoing inflammation within the pulp chamber with rapid buildup of pressure, occlusion of blood vessels at the apical foramen, ischemia, and necrosis of the pulp tissue.</p><p>Irreversible pulpitis is characterized by acute and intense pain and is one of the most frequent reasons that patients seek emergency dental care. Apart from removal of the tooth, the customary approach to relieving the pain of irreversible pulpitis is by drilling into the tooth, removing the inflamed pulp (nerve), and cleaning the root canal. A minority of dentists begins with a trial of antibiotics and analgesics, although there is no proof of benefit from this approach.</p><p>A 2013 literature review found only one randomized controlled trial that compared treatment with systemic antibiotics to placebo in irreversible pulpitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In this trial, 40 patients were treated with analgesics and randomly assigned to either penicillin or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. No operative endodontic treatment was performed. Although the study was limited by small sample size, no significant difference in pain intensity or use of analgesics was noted between the two groups. Photoactivated disinfection has been evaluated as an aid to mechanical irrigation in eradicating bacterial counts within the root canal during endodontic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].
