It can occur as a primary condition, or it can occur with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or another systemic autoimmune disease. Patients with SLE frequently have aPL, whereas the development of APS is much less common. aPL can also be found in healthy individuals. The main types of aPL of concern during pregnancy are lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), and anti-beta-2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies.</p><p>This topic will discuss the potential impact of APS and aPL alone during pregnancy, as well as the management of APS during pregnancy and postpartum.

In prospective studies, lupus anticoagulant appears to be the major predictor of poor pregnancy outcome in women with APS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The number of different aPL specificities also appears to be a prognostic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. For example, in a multicenter retrospective cohort&nbsp;study of 750 singleton pregnancies with primary APS treated with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin from the first trimester, the incidence of live birth was 80 percent in the 7 percent of women with lupus anticoagulant only, 56 percent in the 61 percent of women with anticardiolipin antibodies only, 48 percent in the 17 percent of women with anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I only, 43 percent in the 12 percent of women with anticardiolipin and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibodies but lupus anticoagulant-negative, and 30 percent in the 3 percent of women with all three aPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Compared with women with only one antibody-positive result, women with multiple antibody-positive results had a 29 percent reduction in live-birth rate (41 versus 57 percent; adjusted odds ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.90) and increased risks for disorders associated with placental insufficiency. A limitation of retrospective studies is that all tests were not routinely performed in all patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3103283149\"><span class=\"h4\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of pregnancy morbidity in APS is incompletely understood, but is thought to involve platelet and endothelial cell activation as well as procoagulant effects of aPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although uteroplacental thrombosis and vascular insufficiency may be one mechanism for adverse pregnancy outcome, not all affected placentas display signs of thrombosis or infarction. aPL also appears to have a direct effect on human placental trophoblast function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], decreasing trophoblast viability, syncytialization, and capacity for invasion as measured by an in vitro assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, aPL may affect the production of hormones and signaling molecules by cells in the trophoblast, and stimulate coagulation and complement activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Placental neutrophil extracellular traps are characteristic of APS dysfunctional placentas, though similar findings characterize placentas from preeclamptic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another hypothesis proposes that aPL induces factors that activate Toll-like receptor 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2328701789\"><span class=\"h3\">Thromboembolic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy and the puerperium are normally associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic disease, and this risk is particularly high in pregnant women with APS. In prospective studies, the risk of thromboembolic disease during pregnancy or postpartum was 5 to 12 percent among women with known APS (compared with 0.025 to 0.10 percent in the general obstetric population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Venous thromboses are more common than arterial thromboses. The risk of both venous and arterial <span class=\"nowrap\">thrombosis&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;thromboembolism</span> is increased in individuals with positive tests for lupus anticoagulant activity, medium or high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies, and in those with positivity to three aPLs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Thrombotic events'</a>.)</p><p>Women with thrombosis-associated APS may have higher rates of pregnancy complications than those with only obstetric-associated APS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358207133\"><span class=\"h3\">Neonatal APS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal APS is defined by the same criteria as APS in other populations: presence of at least one type of aPL in serum and the occurrence of at least one clinical feature, such as venous or arterial thromboses or thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A confounding factor, however, is that aPL in the neonate almost always results from placental transfer of maternal antibody, and thus may not have the same significance as endogenously-produced antibody. Passively-acquired aPL completely disappears by 6 to 12 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Neonatal APS is rare. Studies reporting the neonatal outcome of maternal APS have not described any cases of neonatal APS among 277 neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]; a registry that collects outcome data on pregnancies complicated by APS also has not recorded any cases of neonatal APS during follow-up of 134 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, a literature review found 16 case reports of thrombosis in infants born to women with aPL, and 12 of these infants met criteria for neonatal APS (for the other four infants, aPL was detected only in the mother) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Causality related to aPL has not been established. Some authors attribute morbidity to local vascular injury, others to the antibody itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/24,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2747442797\"><span class=\"h2\">aPL without APS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for aPL testing are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome#H389747\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;, section on 'When to suspect the diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>It is unclear whether women with aPL who do not meet criteria for APS are at increased risk of pregnancy morbidity. The body of evidence suggests little or no increase in risk in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The risk of first-time thrombosis in pregnant women with aPL and no personal history of thrombosis is also uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Furthermore, there is no strong evidence for an association between aPL and primary infertility, in vitro fertilization failure, or mild or <span class=\"nowrap\">near-term/term</span> preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>].</p><p>Most patients without APS who are aPL positive in the first trimester (defined as aCL or anti-beta<sub>2</sub>-GPI &ge;40 units or lupus anticoagulant positive) remain in the high-positive range throughout pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Modest decreases in aPL have been observed during the course of pregnancy, but have not been associated with changes in pregnancy outcomes. Conversion from negative to positive occurs infrequently and is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, repeat measurement of aPL during pregnancy is unnecessary.</p><p>Although associations between aPL and pregnancy morbidity have been reported in women without APS, the association is weak. The reported prevalence of aCL in women with uncomplicated pregnancies ranges from 0 to 11 percent, with a median value of about 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/30,31,41-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31,41-47</a>]. Since aPL can be found in normal asymptomatic individuals, a causal relationship between these antibodies and a clinical event in any individual is difficult to prove, particularly when the adverse obstetrical outcome is relatively common (eg, spontaneous abortion before 10 weeks). Additional explanations for the poor predictive value of positive aPL results include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reliance upon nonstandardized assays for aPL and failure to use internationally-recognized standards.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to control for the severity of coexisting disorders known to cause adverse obstetrical outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to perform repeat confirmatory aPL testing (repeat aPL testing should be performed &gt;12 weeks after the first positive aPL test).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inclusion of patients with low positive aPL levels among patients considered positive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Broad <span class=\"nowrap\">criteria/definitions</span> for case selection in series involving pregnancy loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variable thrombogenic potential of a given patient's aPL.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434078930\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF APS DURING PREGNANCY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3763001281\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to antithrombotic treatment of pregnant women with APS varies depending on whether they have APS based on a prior thrombosis versus an APS-associated pregnancy morbidity. A suggested approach is summarized in the table and algorithm, as well as the clinical scenarios discussed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F91501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91501 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F117209\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef117209 \">algorithm 1</a>). When selecting anticoagulation regimens during pregnancy, we prefer low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, and avoid oral anticoagulants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-anticoagulants-during-pregnancy-and-postpartum#H5711523\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum&quot;, section on 'Choice of anticoagulant'</a>). If heparin is contraindicated because of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which occurs rarely in pregnancy, then <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danaparoid-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danaparoid</a> or fondaparinux are reasonable options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Although one meta-analysis reported the optimum dose may be 100 to 150 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], 81 mg is a more practical dose as 100 to 150 mg doses are not readily available in the United States. Taking one and one-half 81 mg tablets is an option.
