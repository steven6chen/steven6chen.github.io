Failure of the mature AV fistula and other complications of AV fistulas, such as steal syndrome, aneurysm formation, infection, and excess flow leading to heart failure, are reviewed separately.

Whether an AV fistula will mature without additional intervention is generally apparent at four to six weeks following creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Early fistula evaluation enables identification of areas of stenosis in nonmaturing fistulas, which can then be safely and effectively treated with appropriate intervention. In many cases, a detailed physical examination of the access will point to the cause of the arrested maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. If an abnormality is detected, further evaluation of the AV fistula should be accomplished as soon as possible, usually with duplex ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] or angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maturation-and-evaluation-of-the-newly-created-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maturation and evaluation of the newly created hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141715573\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We define primary failure as an arteriovenous (AV) fistula that has never been usable for dialysis or that fails within three months of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. The emphasis is generally on failure of maturation. The terms &quot;primary failure,&quot; &quot;early failure,&quot; and &quot;failure to mature&quot; are frequently heard and are essentially equivalent. We shall use the term &quot;primary failure.&quot; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60136729\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary AV fistula failure has always been a problem. However, as efforts have intensified to preferentially create AV fistulas, the incidence of primary failure has increased. When the radiocephalic AV fistula was first described in 1966 by Cimino and Brescia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], the primary AV fistula failure rate was approximately 11 percent. Subsequent older studies reported primary failure rates ranging from 10 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In later reports, the incidence has increased, ranging from 20 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/10-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-21</a>]. Why the change? The average blood pump speed has increased from 200 to 400-450 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span>. The average dialysis patient age in the early period was 43 years, and almost all had chronic glomerulonephritis. Dialysis patients are now much older (&gt;70), and 75 percent have five or more comorbidities; 90 percent have cardiovascular disease, and 50 percent have diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It should not be surprising that creating and achieving a functional AV fistula is frequently a challenge in this population.

Among the three most commonly created AV fistulas (radial-cephalic, brachial-cephalic, brachial-basilic transposition), the primary failure rate for the brachial-basilic transposed fistula has been reported to be the lowest, followed by the brachial-cephalic, and then the radial-cephalic with the highest rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/36-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60151285\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to realize that many potential problems associated with arteriovenous (AV) fistulas can be largely avoided by proper patient evaluation (vascular mapping) prior to access creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/42,45-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45-51</a>]. If vascular mapping has been performed and used in the creation of an AV fistula, most cases of primary failure will have typical lesions that can be classified as inflow or outflow problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Both of these overlap anatomically within the body of the AV fistula itself. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic hemodialysis vascular access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure#H2863155179\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula failure&quot;, section on 'Hemodynamic'</a>.)</p><p>Most investigators agree that nearly 100 percent of AV fistulas that present with failure to mature have an anatomic problem of some type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8,52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,52-56</a>]. Multiple problems are frequently present when an AV fistula fails. In one report of 100 cases of primary failure, 34 percent had more than one lesion present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another, multiple lesions were observed in 85 of 123 cases (71.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>Three important principles relate to primary failure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A distinct lesion or lesions can generally be identified as the cause. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The location of lesion(s) can generally be identified by physical examination and confirmed by imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lesion(s) can be corrected with a high expectation of success (except for certain preexisting lesions, which should have been avoided by good vascular mapping).</p><p/><p>The lesions causing primary failure generally fall into two general categories: those that existed prior to the creation of the access and those that are acquired and the result of the surgical procedure itself. (See <a href=\"#H215935147\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of specific lesions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60152049\"><span class=\"h2\">Missed preexisting lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions and important anatomic features that should have been detected and addressed (or avoided) preoperatively are sometimes missed during preoperative vascular evaluation, in part because vascular mapping is not universally performed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67648747\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In case series, both preexisting arterial and venous stenosis have been reported as causes of primary AV fistula failure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflow artery stenosis &ndash; As an example, in cases in which vascular mapping has been performed, finding an artery that is small or stenotic generally results in the rejection of that site for the creation of the AV fistula. Nevertheless, among patients in whom an AV fistula fails to mature, small arteries or arteries with focal stenotic lesions have been reported as a cause with an incidence in the range of 4 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/52,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,57</a>]. In a small study, 30.5 percent of radiocephalic AV fistula access dysfunction was due to radial artery stenoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. When an AV fistula is created, the artery dilates and increases its blood flow (arterial maturation) in parallel with dilation and increasing blood flow in the AV fistula. If this fails to occur, the AV fistula may not mature. There are those who would classify this as a diffusely stenotic artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has been used to dilate these focal and diffuse lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Other inflow problems may include subclavian artery or brachial artery stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal venous stenosis &ndash; Focal venous stenosis may also be associated with primary failure. In reported series, proximal venous stenosis occurs in 4 to 59 percent, and central venous stenosis is documented in 2.6 to 9 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8,52,53,57,61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,52,53,57,61-63</a>]. The wide variation in reported incidence is perhaps related to variability in the extent of preoperative evaluation (case selection). In cases with proximal venous stenosis, the problem may be recognized by an AV fistula that appears to mature too quickly or that becomes dilated very early but does not have inadequate flow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse venous stenosis &ndash; A marker that an AV fistula is likely to mature is dilation of the vein following completion of the anastomosis, with a progressive increase in diameter to a size that permits repeated cannulation for hemodialysis. The most important factor limiting the creation of an AV fistula is the use of a suitable vein, and based upon the available evidence, a vein smaller than 2.5 mm is inadequate. In some cases, even with an appropriately sized vein, venous dilation fails to occur. In other cases, a small vessel is used due to limited availability in the hopes that the vein will nevertheless dilate to the required size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In each of these instances, PTA has been used to achieve a usable vascular access. In these cases, sequential PTA has been used to progressively enlarge the vein and achieve a usable dialysis access. This technique has been referred to as balloon-assisted maturation (BAM).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When discussing the problem of diffuse venous stenosis, the first issue that should be addressed is one of definition. Areas of focal venous stenosis of differing lengths may be encountered. The question is, at what point does one consider the case to be one of diffuse venous stenosis? Additionally, how does one distinguish between a diffusely small vein and a case of diffuse venous stenosis? The literature does not offer any clear definition to aid in resolving these questions. In some instances, the nonmaturing AV fistula that is manifest as a diffusely small vein actually represents a problem with inflow. The remodeling necessary for the development of a functional AV fistula is dependent upon blood flow. If inflow is inadequate, the AV fistula does not develop. Once the inflow problem is resolved, the AV fistula may develop normally. Nevertheless, cases do present in which diffuse narrowing (stenosis) of the vein representing the AV fistula is present. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67648754\"><span class=\"h3\">Accessory veins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another type of preexisting problem that can affect AV fistula development and maturation is the presence of accessory veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8,53,56,61,62,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,53,56,61,62,65,66</a>]. These are tributaries primarily to the forearm cephalic vein that was used for the construction of the AV fistula. The upper-arm superficial veins do not normally have any significant tributaries. Accessory veins represent normal anatomy, and as such, they should not be erroneously referred to as collateral veins; the latter are pathologic and related to outflow stenosis. Unfortunately, the distinction is not always clear; stenosis can make a normally present accessory vein larger and more prominent. </p><p>Preoperative assessment looking for accessory veins is generally recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. It has been proposed that ligation of these vessels during initial AV fistula creation could potentially reduce nonmaturation. However, with increasing flow following the creation of an AV fistula, veins that were initially judged to be without significance can become more prominent. Additionally, those that were not within the immediate surgical field may not have been noticed.</p><p>While accessory veins are relatively common in the forearm in association with the cephalic vein, most are not problematic. In fact, they are often an advantage in that they can serve to maintain continued flow through the AV fistula when the main channel becomes stenotic or obstructed. In this situation, an accessory vein may develop to the point that it actually becomes usable for cannulation. However, a large accessory vein can adversely affect maturation of the main channel of the AV fistula or cause confusion with cannulation. In these circumstances, ligation or obliteration of the vessel may be advantageous.</p><p>The reported treatment frequency for accessory veins varies widely (4 to 78 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8,53,56,61,62,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,53,56,61,62,66</a>]. This probably represents differences in case selection. When all primary failure cases are systematically evaluated, an incidence in the lower portion of this range can be anticipated. This is almost exclusively a problem with forearm AV fistulas. Accessory veins that are felt to be the cause of nonmaturation are treated by ligation, which should immediately improve flow in the AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8,53,56,61,62,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,53,56,61,62,65,66</a>].

This is defined as stenosis occurring within the first 3 to 4 cm of the AV fistula, immediately adjacent to the arterial anastomosis. The luminal narrowing decreases AV fistula flow, leading to problems of maturation, and often early thrombosis. Regardless of the etiology, the pathologic evaluation of this lesion is always consistent with neointimal hyperplasia. </p><p>Juxta-anastomotic stenosis is amenable to treatment with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8,52,53,56,68-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,52,53,56,68-78</a>] or alternatively with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/28,75,76,79-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,75,76,79-84</a>].

Observational studies, primarily from surgical groups, have suggested that surgery provides better primary patency compared with PTA, but assisted patency rates may be no different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215935147\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultimately, accurate diagnosis and localization of lesions that led to maturation failure rely on angiography. However, since many of these patients have not yet begun dialysis and virtually all have significant residual renal function, concern related to the renal toxicity of iodinated contrast has been expressed. However, the volume of iodinated contrast used for the evaluation in primary AV fistula failure is generally not enough to cause problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>].

Duplex ultrasound may be necessary to differentiate these. Although this situation represents a greater challenge than the dysfunctional AV fistula, some of these cases can be salvaged. In one report of 148 thrombosed immature AV fistulas, only eight cases were deemed unsalvageable with initial ultrasound evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Among the remaining 140 cases, 119 (85 percent) had a successful thrombectomy procedure. A variety of lesions required treatment in these cases. Following thrombectomy, additional procedures were required to attain AV fistula maturation. One hundred and eleven of the successfully treated cases were ultimately used for dialysis. Postmaturation primary patency for 108 cases (three were lost to follow-up) at three months was 53 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70111\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70111 \">table 1</a>).

However, there have been reports in which an artery that is smaller than optimal has been used. This is more likely to occur with a radial artery. The distinction between an artery that is diffusely stenotic versus being simply too small to provide sufficient flow is not clear; however, in these cases the term &quot;stenotic&quot; has generally been applied. There has not been enough experience using the angioplasty for the treatment of diffuse stenosis of the radial artery to establish a recommendation related to this procedure. In addition, the reported complication rate should cause concern.

BAM involves the sequential dilatation of the usable portion of the AV fistula using a progressively larger-diameter balloon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access#H2546942941\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for angioplasty of the arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Angioplasty technique'</a>.)</p><p>This procedure has a long history and appears to be increasingly popular, in spite of few evidence-based studies and no randomized trials. In some cases, the vein is essentially converted into a collagen tube. In addition, there are reports of BAM being performed intraoperatively in an attempt to create an AV fistula in a patient vessel otherwise considered suboptimal for AV fistula creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].</p><p>In one review, 373 patients were treated using BAM over a three-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The initial procedure generally took place two to four weeks after creation of the AV fistula. The inflow and juxta-anastomotic segments were dilated to 4 mm, and the usable segment of the AV fistula was dilated to 4 to 6 mm with the initial treatment. Subsequent dilatations were performed at two- to four-week intervals, with an average of 2.7 sequential dilations required to achieve the desired goal (forearm AV fistula 8 to 10 mm; upper arm AV fistula 10 to 16 mm). Using this approach, a usable AV fistula was created in 94 percent.</p><p>In another study, technical success using BAM was achieved in 118 of 122 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. The AV fistulas were divided into two groups. Class 1 AV fistulas were those that were mature (6 to 8 mm in diameter) but were more than 6 mm deep. In these patients, angioplasty was used to make the vessel large enough to cannulate in spite of its depth. Class 2 AV fistulas were those that were not mature (2 to 5 mm), and angioplasty was used to assist maturation. The number of procedures required to achieve maturation in the class 2 cases was 2.6 over a mean of seven weeks. Following BAM, primary patency of class 2 cases was 39 percent at six months. Secondary patency was 77 percent at 12 months, 61 percent at 24 months, and 32 percent at 36 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67648879\"><span class=\"h2\">Accessory veins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When patients present with nonmaturation of their AV fistula and a sizable accessory vein is present, the first challenge is to determine if it is significant enough to be the etiology of the problem. To make this determination, the first step is to rule out a downstream (ie, in the direction of flow) stenosis. If a stenotic lesion is present, the anomalous vein is most likely a collateral. This stenotic lesion should be treated prior to further evaluation of the side branch for significance. (See <a href=\"#H67648867\" class=\"local\">'Preexisting venous stenosis'</a> above.)</p><p>If there is no stenotic lesion or if the stenotic lesion has been resolved and the vein is still present, the next step is to determine its significance. Significance in the dysfunctional AV fistula should be judged by observing changes that occur with manual occlusion, which are most easily evaluated using a vascular Doppler and comparing the bruit over the AV fistula above the accessory vein with and without occlusion of the vessel in question. Blood flow can be quantified using duplex ultrasound with and without accessory vein compression. One study found that preoperatively detected accessory veins with a diameter &gt;70 percent of the cephalic vein diameter had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 80, 100, 100, and 91 percent for nonmaturation of radial-cephalic AV fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. However, this was based upon a rather small cohort of patients (4 of 10 nonmaturing AV fistulas). </p><p>The relative blood flow in the AV fistula and accessory vein can also be judged subjectively during angiography by comparing flow in the accessory and the main AV fistula side-by-side with a small bolus of iodinated contrast. While this is subjective, it does add weight to a decision to obliterate the accessory vein when other factors are also supportive. </p><p>Once it has been determined that an accessory vein is impeding the maturation of the AV fistula, it can be obliterated by surgical ligation (direct through the skin, or open incision) or percutaneous placement of an embolization coil. Regardless of the technique used, it is helpful to have a guidewire or catheter in the vein. If the accessory vein is easily visible or readily palpable, it can be ligated by anesthetizing the skin over the vein near the body of the AV fistula and placing a suture through the intact skin and around the tributary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The stitch is typically left in place for approximately 10 days and then removed. Alternatively, if the tributary is deep to the skin, a small incision can be made overlying the AV fistula, the vein can be dissected from the surrounding tissue, and a suture placed around it and tied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The more common technique is insertion of one or more embolization coils into the lumen of the accessory vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Once the coil is in position, the vein generally thromboses within a few minutes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67648885\"><span class=\"h2\">Juxta-anastomotic stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The juxta-anastomotic stenosis is also amenable to treatment using PTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8,52,53,56,68-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,52,53,56,68-78</a>]. </p><p>In many cases, two separate lesions are present, a lesion at the anastomosis (arterial lesion) and the lesion in the adjacent segment vein. If both require treatment, two different sizes of angioplasty balloon will generally be required. </p><p>The long-term results of angioplasty for the treatment of juxta-anastomotic stenosis were evaluated along with prognostic factors that might influence the clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. A total of 147 procedures were performed in 75 radiocephalic AV fistulas with this lesion (18 percent immature, 69 percent mature, 13 percent unknown). At one and three years, primary patency rates were 46.6 and 25.5 percent, respectively, and assisted primary patency rates were 81.3 percent and 63.2 percent, respectively. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected primary assisted patency was the degree of residual stenosis after the first angioplasty. For the entire group: for residual stenosis &lt;50 percent, one- and two-year assisted primary patency rates were 84.6 and 76.1 percent, respectively; for residual stenosis &gt;50 percent, assisted primary patency rates were reduced to 62.3 and 46.8 percent, respectively. </p><p>Surgery has also been advocated for the treatment of juxta-anastomotic stenosis. In a retrospective review, the outcome and cost of surgery and angioplasty for juxta-anastomotic lesions in forearm AV fistulas were compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. In this study, 64 fistulas with &gt;50 percent venous juxta-anastomotic stenosis were treated (11 with proximal neoanastomosis, 10 with polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] interposition graft, 43 with angioplasty). Initial procedural success was 100 percent for surgery and 95 percent for angioplasty. The rate of restenosis was significantly lower for surgery compared with PTA (0.168 versus 0.519 <span class=\"nowrap\">events/AV-fistula-year)</span>. The cost profile also was similar for the two procedures. Although primary patency following surgery is better, assisted patency rates appear to be similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Since angioplasty does not exclude the possibility of a later surgical correction, if required, a reasonable approach would be to perform a PTA first, reserving the surgical approach as a backup in case of failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67648891\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES FOR FISTULA SALVAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results gained by the treatment of nonmaturing arteriovenous (AV) fistulas have been variable. Nevertheless, when compared with the alternative of abandonment, one is forced to conclude that the results are extraordinarily good. It is very possible that the outcome differences in reported series are due to variability in the populations studied. Prescreening of cases may have led to case selection favoring a successful outcome. The degree to which this was done is not clear in most reports. </p><p>A systematic review to review reported success rates and complications of interventions performed for primary AV fistula failure identified 12 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. The rate of clinical success, defined as the ability to use the AV fistula at least once for hemodialysis, was 86 percent. The average one-year primary patency rate was 51 percent (range, 28 to 68 percent). The average one-year secondary patency rate was 76 percent (range, 72 to 95 percent). The overall complication rate was 9.3 percent. The majority of these were minor complications. </p><p>An example of a single-center study is one that collected data on 141 cases of primary AV fistula failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. All cases in this cohort had significant anatomic causes for their failure of maturation. Multiple sites of stenotic lesions were found in 46.1 percent of patients. The sites of stenosis were juxta-anastomotic venous segment (65.2 percent), venous outflow (41.1 percent), arteriovenous anastomosis (30.5 percent), native artery (5.7 percent), distal outflow (9.2 percent), and central vein (3.5 percent). Technical success was achieved in 95.7 percent and clinical success in 86.5 percent. The primary patency rate was 71.9, 60.1, and 54.5 percent at one, two, and three years, respectively. The respective secondary patency rates for the same time periods were 82.8, 82.0, and 82.0 percent. </p><p>There is evidence to suggest that, compared with AV fistulas that mature without intervention, AV fistulas that require intervention have decreased cumulative survival and require more procedures to maintain their patency for hemodialysis. In a review of 173 patients requiring intervention for a nonmaturing AV fistula, 96 (56 percent) required no further intervention, 54 (31 percent) required one intervention, and 23 (13 percent) required two or more interventions to achieve suitability for dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. For patients with &ge;2, one, or zero interventions before maturation, cumulative AV fistula survival (access cannulation to permanent failure) was 68, 78, and 92 percent, respectively, at one year; 57, 71, and 85 percent at two years; and 42, 57, and 75 percent at three years. Using Cox regression analysis, two or more interventions before maturation was the only factor associated with cumulative AV fistula survival. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67648905\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF PRIMARY FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In view of the high primary failure rates that have been reported, it will likely not be possible to totally prevent this complication. There is a prevailing opinion that vascular mapping should be considered mandatory in all patients in whom a dialysis vascular access is planned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/15,42,100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,42,100,101</a>]. The earliest report to strongly support this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] demonstrated a marked increase in the percentage of arteriovenous (AV) fistulas placed (14 to 63 percent) and an equally impressive decrease in primary failure rates (38 to 8.3 percent). Not all studies have demonstrated this degree of benefit, however. In some, the incidence of primary failure has not improved, and in others it has actually increased with vascular mapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/19,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,100</a>]. The reasons for this are not clear. The experience of the surgeon is clearly important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/6,24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24-28</a>]. </p><p>The algorithm that appears to have the best chance of decreasing the incidence of primary failure while increasing the prevalence of AV fistulas is that emphasized by Fistula First [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This approach consists of starting early, performing vascular mapping, selection of an experienced surgeon, evaluation of all newly created AV fistulas at four weeks, and an aggressive program of salvage for primary failures.
