There are two distinct anatomical forms, the cartilaginous malacia characterized by softening of the cartilage and the membranous malacia with excessive forward displacement of the membranous wall (also known as excessive dynamic airway collapse [EDAC]). Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) exists when the weakness extends into one or both main stem bronchi. Both conditions result in exaggerated luminal narrowing during expiration and widening during inspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. </p><p>We refer to TM and TBM collectively as TM in this review, since the conditions manifest similarly and the terms are frequently used interchangeably in practice. We distinguish between the disorders only when necessary.</p><p>The classification, epidemiology, histopathology, natural history, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of TM are reviewed here. Tracheomalacia in children is discussed separately.

This is particularly useful for guiding therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TM can be classified as congenital (ie, primary) or acquired (ie, secondary) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73937\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73937 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Acquired TM is more common than congenital TM in adults.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital TM is the most common congenital tracheal abnormality and occurs in approximately 1:2100 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It can be seen in isolation or be associated with other abnormalities (laryngomalacia and laryngeal clefts) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It may go unrecognized due to clinical features that overlap with more common pulmonary diseases. </p><p>Most types of congenital TM manifest during early childhood and are due to inherited diseases that weaken the trachea (eg, mucopolychondritis). Such disorders are discussed in separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-intrathoracic-airways-and-tracheoesophageal-fistula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the intrathoracic airways and tracheoesophageal fistula&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a type of congenital tracheomegaly that typically presents during adulthood: idiopathic giant trachea (IGT). It is a rare condition caused by atrophy of the longitudinal elastic fibers and thinning of the muscularis mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. IGT can also present as tracheobronchomegaly (Mounier-Kuhn syndrome) when the defect extends into the central bronchi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The peripheral airways maintain a normal diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Tracheobronchomegaly can be diagnosed when the diameter of the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and left mainstem bronchus exceed 3.0, 2.4, and 2.3 cm, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106749\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106749 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These measurements represent three standard deviations above the upper limit of normal in adults.</p><p>The cause of tracheobronchomegaly is uncertain but may be familial, at least partially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients with tracheobronchomegaly mobilize their secretions poorly and, therefore, manifest chronic accumulation of secretions, cough, dyspnea, recurrent infections, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Tracheal diverticuli may develop due to the increased global compliance of the tracheal wall and the development of redundant membranous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are numerous causes of acquired TM in adults. Some of the more common causes are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73937\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73937 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation can damage the tracheal cartilage at the stoma or inflatable cuff site, respectively, which weakens the tracheal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This type of TM is usually segmental, with a length of 3 cm or less (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106750 \">picture 2</a>). Possible risk factors include recurrent intubation, prolonged intubation, and concurrent high-dose steroid therapy. The mechanism is uncertain but may include pressure necrosis, impaired blood flow, recurrent infections, mucosal friction, or mucosal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other types of tracheal cartilage injury can also cause TM. These include external chest trauma and surgery (eg, lung transplantation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic compression of the trachea can cause TM. This is most commonly due to a benign mediastinal goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, it can also be due to malignancy, vascular compression, abscess, cyst, or other benign lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsing polychondritis (RP) leads to the destruction of cartilage and is associated with TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In one study, nearly 50 percent of patients with RP who were evaluated for airway involvement exhibited some degree of TM. Although RP affects men and women equally, severe airway manifestations are three times more likely in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent infection might cause TM. Supporting this hypothesis, TM is common among adults who have chronic bronchitis or cystic fibrosis. In an observational study that included 40 adults with cystic fibrosis and 10 control subjects, TM was detected by computed tomography in 24 of the patients with cystic fibrosis (69 percent) and none of the controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A substantial proportion of patients with severe emphysema and smokers (up to 5 percent) have TM, suggesting that chronic inflammation due to the inhalation of irritants (eg, cigarette smoke) may cause TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Recurrent infections may also play a role. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other conditions and agents that may cause airway inflammation have also been associated with TM. Examples include exposure to mustard gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of TM in adults is uncertain because reports have been based on selected populations instead of general populations. Older studies indicate that acquired TM is most common in men who are over 40 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/4,20,25,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20,25,29,30</a>]. These studies are supported by a study from Japan, in which 4283 patients with pulmonary disease underwent bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The airway caliber narrowed more than 50 percent in 542 patients (12.7 percent). Among these patients, more than 70 percent were aged 50 to 80 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little known about the histopathological changes associated with TM in adults. Autopsy studies have found anteroposterior narrowing of the lumen accompanied by atrophy of the longitudinal elastic fibers and fragmentation of the tracheal cartilage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/25,29,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29,31-34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TM is progressive in most adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/2,25,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25,35,36</a>]. In a study of 17 patients with TM who underwent repeat bronchoscopy, worse airway narrowing was detected in 76 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A larger study followed 94 patients with TM, TBM, or bronchomalacia for an average of 5.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Among those who underwent repeat bronchoscopy, most patients had worse disease, some had stable disease, and none improved. Six of the nine patients with TM progressed to TBM, while all five patients with bronchomalacia progressed to TBM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TM can be asymptomatic, especially if the airway narrowing is mild. However, symptoms or signs often develop as the severity of airway narrowing progresses, if the patient is challenged (eg, during an infection), or in certain clinical situations (eg, general anesthesia, progressive hypercapnic respiratory failure, liberation from mechanical ventilation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>The major symptoms and signs of TM in adults are dyspnea, cough, and sputum retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Severe paroxysms of coughing may interrupt daily activities. Wheezing or stridor may also exist. An associated barking cough (likened to a barking seal) has been reported and some patients report episodic choking, recurrent pulmonary infections, or syncope associated with forced exhalation or cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>]. Maneuvers can sometimes elicit signs of TM, including forced expiration, cough, a Valsalva maneuver, and certain positions (eg, recumbency).</p><p>These symptoms and signs are nonspecific and are often attributed to alternative diagnoses including emphysema, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, cigarette smoking, or asthma. When TM coexists with one or more of these conditions, the symptoms may seem out of proportion to the severity of any condition alone or some patients may remain symptomatic despite maximal medical therapy for the condition being treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoscopic visualization of dynamic airway collapse is considered by many experts the diagnostic gold standard. Some experts also consider the demonstration of dynamic airway collapse on end-expiratory CT as diagnostic, although more research is needed to define exact parameters that accurately predict the diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic modalities that are used to evaluate suspected TM include dynamic flexible bronchoscopy (DFB), dynamic airway computed tomography (DACT), pulmonary function testing, and chest radiography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoscopic visualization of dynamic airway collapse is considered by many experts the diagnostic gold standard. DFB is performed under minimal sedation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, versed, and local anesthesia (1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>) when the patient is able to breathe spontaneously and follow commands. In a pilot study, there was favorable inter- and intra-observer agreement among 23 pulmonologists using DFB to estimate the degree of airway collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-preparation-procedural-technique-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Preparation, procedural technique, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Historically, TM was diagnosed if there was &gt;50 percent decrease in airway lumen size but data from healthy volunteers has shown that this threshold was met in up to 78 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. For this reason, we use a more rigorous criterion to diagnose TM and have changed our thresholds to normal if the operator estimates that the lumen narrows by 70 percent of its initial size during expiration, mild if it narrows by 80 percent, moderate if it narrows by 90 percent, and severe if it narrows by &gt;90 percent or the anterior and posterior walls touch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72199\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72199 \">picture 3</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Some studies used deep breathing, forced expiration, Valsalva maneuvers, cough, and other maneuvers to elicit airway collapse during bronchoscopy. However, the significance of airway collapse in response to such maneuvers is unknown because the degree of airway collapse and the amount of expiratory effort have never been correlated and sometimes such maneuvers can induce bronchospasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) may be useful in the diagnosis of TM with reported accuracy rates as high as 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. Dynamic CT scan of the central airways includes images at the end of inspiration and during forced expiration taken in a caudal-cranial direction. To calculate the degree of airway collapse or collapsibility index (CI), the dynamic expiratory area (DEA) is subtracted from the area at end inspiration (AEI) and this number is then divided by the AEI and multiplied by 100. CI = <span class=\"nowrap\">(AEI-DEA/AEI)</span> x 100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Criteria for diagnosing TM by CT are currently the same as those for diagnosing TM by bronchoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52229\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52229 \">image 2</a>). The airways are measured in cross-section on images obtained at end-expiration.</p><p>Diagnostic assessment by CT requires additional study and refinement before CT surpasses bronchoscopy as the diagnostic gold standard. At least one observational study has found that CT can reliably predict TM, especially when the predictive measure is the degree to which the sagittal diameter decreases from end-inhalation to end-exhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, the current diagnostic criterion of greater than 50 percent luminal narrowing may not be the optimal diagnostic threshold, since it is met in up to 78 percent of control subjects during forced exhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The findings from the latter study underscore the variability of the normal collapsibility of the trachea. More research is needed to define what threshold might be used during CT evaluation to accurately predict clinically significant collapse of the airway.</p><p>Ultrafast multidetector CT scanners permit volumetric central airway imaging in only a few seconds. This allows true dynamic assessment of TM because the airway can be imaged during a forced exhalation or cough maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) can provide data supportive of a diagnosis of TM, but they are not diagnostic. Spirometry usually demonstrates obstruction that is proportional to the severity of the TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/36,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,46</a>]. In a descriptive study of 90 patients with moderate to severe tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) who underwent pulmonary function testing, 44 percent of patients had an obstructive ventilatory defect, 18 percent had a definite or highly likely restrictive ventilatory defect, 17 percent had a mixed defect, and 21 percent were within normal limits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>The flow-volume loop (FVL) is characterized by a low peak expiratory flow rate followed by a rapid decrease of flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77738\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77738 \">figure 2</a>). In one study, the most frequent finding was low FEFmax in 82 percent of cases, followed by biphasic morphology 20 percent, notched expiratory loop 9 percent, expiratory oscillations (alternating decelerations and accelerations of flow) 3 percent, and 17 percent had no distinctive FVL abnormality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106751\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106751 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, in a retrospective review of 2800 flow-volume loops, flow oscillations were identified in 40 patients (1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Physiological upper airway obstruction was detected in 14 of these patients (35 percent). These oscillations can be caused by TM, redundant pharyngeal tissue, neuromuscular disease, or structural or functional disorders of the larynx and are not diagnostic of TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway narrowing or dilation due to TM is a dynamic process, occurring at certain points during the respiratory cycle. Thus, routine anteroposterior and lateral chest radiographs often do not show an abnormality. In circumstances in which the TM is caused by compression from other structures (eg, mediastinal goiter), the underlying abnormality may be detectable on plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TM may be suspected on the basis of a patient's symptoms and signs. Alternatively, it may be suspected on the basis of pulmonary function test results or a chest imaging that was performed for evaluation of the related symptoms and signs.</p><p>Once TM is suspected, the patient should undergo both dynamic CT and bronchoscopy with forced exhalation maneuvers to evaluate the degree of TM. Both tests are necessary because either test alone may underestimate the degree of TM. As an example, sedation for bronchoscopy may prevent maximal effort during a forced exhalation maneuver, thereby underestimating the severity of the TM. If the forced exhalation maneuver is repeated during a CT scan when the patient is not sedated, the collapsibility of the airway may be more accurately determined. The converse may also occur.</p><p>CT and bronchoscopy have unique advantages. CT is better able to show the distal extent of the TM when it extends into the segmental and subsegmental bronchi. This has implications for treatment, since neither stenting nor surgical options can correct the distal disease. Bronchoscopy provides information about the ease of navigation into and within the airways, which is useful for planning future interventions.</p><p>The severity of TM is determined as described above. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoscopy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A useful approach to the management of TM is shown in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57344\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57344 \">algorithm 1</a>). First, it is determined whether a patient with TM is symptomatic. Asymptomatic patients generally do not require therapy, whereas therapy may be warranted for patients who are symptomatic.</p><p>Initial treatment of symptomatic patients targets the underlying cause of the TM and coexisting conditions. Patients with coexisting asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can improve, if their medical regimen is optimized, by decreasing the degree of bronchospasm and large pressure swings in the thorax that worsen the collapse of the central airways. The treatment of gastroesophageal reflux and diseases such as relapsing polychondritis reduces airway inflammation and symptoms and may slow progression of disease. Following optimization of all coexisting conditions, a functional assessment is performed (eg, PFTs, six-minute walk test, quality of life assessment, dyspnea and cough scores) in patients who remain symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The purpose of this assessment is to establish a baseline from which the response to therapy can be objectively measured.</p><p>We insert silicone stents next, as a means of identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from central airway stabilization.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are not surgical candidates, but who objectively improve following stent insertion, may be managed with long-term stenting. Due to a high incidence of stent related complications (mucus plug or granulation tissue formation) it is recommended that these patients have close clinical and bronchoscopic follow up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are surgical candidates and objectively improve following stent insertion can be referred for definitive surgical repair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not improve with stenting should have the stents removed. No intervention may in this case be offered unless the symptom profile becomes extreme. In this situation, positive pressure therapy may be beneficial.</p><p/><p>It is important to emphasize that improvement or lack of improvement following the insertion of the silicone stents needs to be objectively demonstrated and documented before the long-term intervention is chosen and implemented.</p><p>An exception to this approach exists when the primary symptom of the TM is not dyspnea. Examples include patients whose primary symptom is severe paroxysmal cough or recurrent infection (more than three per year). In such cases, a stent trial probably will not yield improvement and the decision regarding surgery must be made on the basis of symptoms and abnormal anatomy alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relief of focal airway obstruction via stenting often provides immediate improvement of both airflow and symptoms according to several case series and observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/17-19,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19,56-58</a>], although these findings have not been universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Silicone stents are preferred for the management of TM. Although their insertion requires rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia, they are easily repositioned and removed. Their major disadvantage is that silicone stents often migrate or plug with mucus, which generally manifests as a new cough, hoarseness, or dyspnea. Stent migration requires repositioning, removal, or replacement of the stent, while mucus plugging will need a bronchoscopic aspiration of secretions under direct visualization. More recently, silicone Y-shaped stents are used and migration can be prevented when compared to previous tubular silicone stents. However, other stent-related complications (eg, infection, cough, mucus-plugging, and granulation tissue formation) occur with similar frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>Metal stents have been used to manage many types of airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Metal stents have some advantages, including easy placement by flexible bronchoscopy, dynamic expansion, and preservation of mucociliary function with some stent types. However, long term use is not recommended for benign airway obstruction. In addition, they are a poor choice for the treatment of TM because they cannot be easily removed and are associated with numerous complications such that the US Food and Drug Administration have issued a black box warning regarding their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Potential complications include the formation of granulation tissue and breakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The latter can cause severe problems including airway obstruction and perforation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73938\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73938 \">picture 4</a>). Airway stenting is discussed in detail separately.

It is the definitive operative treatment for TM. A right posterolateral thoracotomy is used to approach both the thoracic trachea and bilateral bronchi. Polypropylene mesh is sutured to the posterior membranous wall and anchored to the cartilaginous edges of the trachea and bronchi. The sutures are placed in partial-thickness fashion, resulting in a posterior splint that is entirely external to the airway lumen. This splint reconstitutes a C-shape to the tracheal cartilage and prevents the posterior membrane from intruding into the lumen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53691\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53691 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62393\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62393 \">image 3</a>). A prospective cohort study that followed 35 patients with severe symptomatic tracheomalacia for three months following tracheobronchoplasty found that quality of life, dyspnea, mean exercise capacity, and functional status significantly improved following the procedure, compared to baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional resection and reconstruction is utilized in cases of focal malacia, most commonly in the cervical trachea. It has a low morbidity and mortality in experienced hands and provides curative relief without the need for multiple endoscopic interventions. However, like any resection of the trachea, it can have the unintended consequence of re-narrowing the trachea (ie, tracheal stenosis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheal replacement refers to replacement of the defective trachea with a new trachea made out of foreign material, donor tissue, nonviable tissue, autogenous tissue, or engineered tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. It has been considered for decades, but a reliable tracheal replacement has not been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Tracheostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tracheostomy alone may be effective if the tracheostomy tube bypasses the abnormal tracheal segment or splints the abnormal airway open. Longer segments of TM may require longer tracheostomy tubes. Even if the TM is diffuse, tracheostomy may be beneficial as a route to deliver positive airway pressure.</p><p>A tracheal T-tube is a type of stent. It has a narrow tube that connects at a right angle to a larger tube, forming the shape of the letter T. The narrow tube passes from the tracheal lumen through a cervical stoma, similar to a standard tracheostomy tube. The larger tube functions like a straight stent, spanning the cervical trachea. The inferior aspect of the larger tube can extend into the thoracic trachea. The airflow during breathing is through the lumen of the larger tube and the larynx if the narrow tube is capped externally. In contrast, the airflow is through both the narrow tube and the larynx if the narrow tube is uncapped. Occasionally, a silicone tracheal T-tube is used for long-term stenting, especially if the malacic segment is in the cervical or upper thoracic trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106750 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Tracheostomy itself can worsen TM by destroying the tracheal cartilage and weakening the tracheal wall. For this reason, tracheostomy is a treatment of last resort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can maintain an open airway and facilitate secretion drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/16,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,74,75</a>]. This is often initiated in the hospital during an acute illness. The patient initially receives continuous CPAP and is gradually transitioned to intermittent CPAP as tolerated.</p><p>Patients may use intermittent CPAP as long-term therapy. However, CPAP does not appear to have a long-term impact on dyspnea or cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheomalacia-and-tracheobronchomalacia-in-adults/abstract/16,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,74</a>]. The use of automatically adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP) should be used with caution unless it is clear that the minimum pressure provides adequate support. Other types of positive airway pressure, specifically bilevel positive airway pressure should be used if hypercapnic respiratory failure exists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2542467517\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional therapies</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway clearance techniques &ndash; Retained secretions are an important cause of recurrent infections, airway obstruction, and <span class=\"nowrap\">airway/lung</span> injury.

PLB is a breathing technique that consists of exhaling through tightly pressed lips and inhaling through the nose with the mouth closed. The purpose of this technique is to create pressure inside the airways thus producing a pneumatic split during exhalation and decreasing the work of breathing. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheomalacia (TM) refers to diffuse or segmental tracheal weakness. There are two distinct anatomical forms, cartilaginous and membranous. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) exists when the weakness extends into one or both mainstem bronchi. Both conditions result in exaggerated luminal narrowing during expiration and widening during inspiration. TM and TBM manifest similarly and the terms are often used interchangeably. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TM can be asymptomatic, especially if the airway narrowing is mild. However, symptoms and signs frequently develop as the severity of airway narrowing progresses, if the patient becomes challenged, or in certain clinical situations. The major symptoms and signs of TM in adults are dyspnea, cough, sputum retention, and expiratory wheezing or stridor. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dynamic computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy with forced exhalation maneuvers should both be performed when TM is suspected. Criteria for the diagnosis of TM are the same, regardless of which test is used to measure luminal narrowing. TM is diagnosed if there is &gt;50 percent decrease in airway lumen, although some studies suggest that a more rigorous criterion is needed. It is classified as mild if the lumen narrows by 75 percent of its initial size during expiration, moderate if it narrows by 90 percent of its initial size, and severe if it narrows by &gt;90 percent or the anterior and posterior walls touch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72199\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72199 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy is warranted in symptomatic patients with severe TM, but not asymptomatic patients. Initial treatment targets the underlying cause of the TM and all coexisting conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms. Patients who remain symptomatic after initial therapy should undergo a functional assessment (eg, pulmonary function tests, six-minute walk test, dyspnea and cough score). This functional assessment provides a baseline from which treatment response can be measured. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who remain symptomatic after initial therapy, we suggest silicone stenting as the next therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who improve following silicone stent insertion, but are not surgical candidates, we suggest long-term stenting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Tracheobronchoplasty is the definitive operative technique for most patients. This should take place in medical centers with specific expertise in this procedure. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Surgical repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who do not improve after silicone stent insertion, we suggest that the stents be removed (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). No further intervention needs to be offered unless their symptoms become extreme. In this situation, positive pressure therapy or a T-tube may be beneficial.
