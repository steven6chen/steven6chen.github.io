However, all women with cervical cancer should undergo a lymph node evaluation because this information is required in treatment planning.

RT results in an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and may improve overall survival (OS) as well.

This is based on the limited available evidence and the likely higher long-term morbidity with primary RT. </p><p>Studies that have compared primary surgery with primary RT in early cervical cancer suggest that surgery is as or more effective than RT; however, these data are limited. The only randomized trial (n = 343) was conducted in 1997 in women with stage IB and IIA cervical cancer and found that radical surgery compared with RT had equivalent rates of five-year survival (83 percent for both) and disease-free survival (74 percent for both), and comparable recurrence rates (surgery: 25 percent; RT: 26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Severe morbidity was higher with surgery. However, it is uncertain whether these findings can be applied to current practice. </p><p>The largest observational study to address this issue was a retrospective study of 4885 women with stage IB1 to IIA cervical cancer with data from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. Surgery was associated with a survival benefit compared with RT alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.35-0.50) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A limitation of this study was that one-half of the women in the hysterectomy group received adjuvant RT and comparisons were not made between women treated solely with surgery versus RT.</p><p>An important factor in the decision between surgery and RT is that ovarian conservation is possible with surgery, thus avoiding premature menopause and allowing more fertility options in reproductive-age patients. In addition, RT is associated with more long-term sexual dysfunction than surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Based on the available data and other factors, for women with early-stage (stage IA2 through IB1) cervical cancer, we suggest a modified radical hysterectomy rather than primary RT. Some gynecologic oncologists also offer radical hysterectomy to women with stage IB2 or IIA disease with small tumor diameter and no positive lymph nodes. For this patient population, we reserve primary RT with or without chemoradiation for women who are not candidates for primary surgery due to medical comorbidities or poor functional status. Another exception is stage IA1 cancer, which may be treated with more conservative surgery. (See <a href=\"#H5482002\" class=\"local\">'Extrafascial hysterectomy or conization'</a> below.). </p><p>The administration of primary RT as a single-modality treatment has largely been replaced by the use of concomitant chemoradiation, especially in the management of advanced cervical cancer. However, for the small proportion of women with early-stage disease who are best treated with primary RT, there are no data regarding whether chemoradiation improves treatment efficacy. Also, the addition of chemotherapy is likely to increase morbidity. Thus, we treat these patients with primary RT alone. </p><p>The use of RT as primary treatment for early-stage cervical cancer is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H618915770\" class=\"local\">'Primary RT'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57553162\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5482037\"><span class=\"h4\">Radical hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard treatment for stage IA2 and most IB1 cervical cancers is a modified radical hysterectomy (class II hysterectomy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57850 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. Modified radical hysterectomy includes removal of the uterus, cervix, upper one-fourth of the vagina, and parametria.</p><p>Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed at the time of radical hysterectomy; paraaortic lymphadenectomy is performed if the pelvic nodes are suspicious for metastatic disease. Ovarian metastases are less common with squamous cell histology than adenocarcinoma (0.8 versus 5 percent in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]); thus ovaries are typically preserved in women with squamous histology and more commonly removed in those with adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer who have larger lesions (&gt;2 cm) will typically undergo a radical hysterectomy (class III hysterectomy) that includes removal of more vaginal tissue (up to the upper one-half) and parametrial tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical hysterectomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-adenocarcinoma#H96574101\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Differences in patterns of dissemination and recurrence'</a>.)</p><p>Modified radical hysterectomy is an effective treatment for women with low-risk early-stage cervical cancer. As an example, in a retrospective series of 1253 women treated, the rate of recurrence at 12-year follow-up was: stage IA (1 of 104; 0.1 percent) and IB1 (40 of 762; 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Radical hysterectomy may be performed via laparotomy, conventional laparoscopy, or robotic-assisted laparoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-hysterectomy#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Laparoscopic techniques'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5482002\"><span class=\"h4\">Extrafascial hysterectomy or conization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with cervical conization or extrafascial hysterectomy is limited to women with microinvasive disease (stage IA1) who have no evidence of intermediate- or high-risk features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Conization is often performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation and staging procedure for cervical cancer. Repeat conization is required if there is a positive margin. Extrafascial hysterectomy, also referred to as simple hysterectomy, involves removal of the uterus and cervix, but not the parametria or more than the upper margin of the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57850 \">table 2</a>). Given that patients who are candidates for these procedures by definition are at low risk for lymph node involvement, pelvic lymphadenectomy is not indicated.</p><p>Women with microinvasive cervical carcinoma have an extremely low risk of recurrence. This was best illustrated in a literature review of women with squamous cervical cancer that reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 2274 women with stromal invasion &lt;1 mm, three (0.1 percent) had lymph node metastases.

The rate of recurrence was 1.7 percent (23 cases).</p><p/><p>An important limitation of this study was that it reported only depth of invasion, but not horizontal spread, so the stage could not be confirmed.</p><p>Most surgeons perform conization alone for women who wish to preserve their fertility and extrafascial hysterectomy for women who desire definitive treatment. In patients undergoing extrafascial hysterectomy, the surgical approach may be vaginal, laparoscopic, robotic-assisted laparoscopic, or abdominal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6927014\"><span class=\"h4\">Fertility-sparing surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women of reproductive age who wish to preserve their fertility and have a lesion size &le;2 cm and no lymph node metastases, we suggest uterus-preserving surgery rather than radical hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The surgical options include conization and removal of the cervix alone while leaving the uterus in place (trachelectomy). LVSI within the tumor is a risk factor for lymph node recurrence, but as a sole finding it is not a contraindication for the trachelectomy. Fertility-sparing surgery for cervical cancer is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-sparing-surgery-for-cervical-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility-sparing surgery for cervical cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H618915770\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We reserve RT as primary treatment for women who are not candidates for surgery due to medical comorbidities or poor functional status. Although some experts prefer chemoradiation in these patients, there are no data demonstrating that the benefits of chemoradiation outweigh the increased morbidity of treatment in women with early-stage cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locally advanced cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Primary chemoradiation'</a>.)</p><p>When indicated, computed tomography (CT)-based planning should be used to adequately visualize the cervix, rectum, bladder, small bowel, and nodal stations. The inferior border should give a minimum margin of 3 to 4 cm from the tumor, which can be aided by the placement of a marker at the time of simulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63554\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63554 \">image 1</a>). A marker can also be placed clinically in the cervix or if there is vaginal extent, at the most distal edge of the tumor. This will help ensure adequate coverage. The presence of distal vaginal disease into the lower one-third of the vagina places the inguinal lymph nodes at risk and they should be included in the treatment field. Patients may be treated in prone or supine positions. For the prone position, a &quot;belly board&quot; is used to displace small bowel superiorly from the pelvis and reduce toxicity.</p><p>Typically, the whole pelvis is treated to 45 Gy in 25 once-daily fractions of 1.8 Gy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are useful for radiation treatment planning to evaluate the size and extent of the primary tumor and the presence and extent of parametrial involvement, bladder or rectal invasion, and nodal disease. These regions are boosted with external beam radiation to 50.4 to 63 Gy. Brachytherapy is used to give the final dose to the cervical primary, to a total of 80 Gy (small-volume cervical tumors) to 87 Gy or higher (larger-volume cervical tumors) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57654\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57654 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546745501\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant therapy indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with early-stage cervical cancer treated with a primary surgical approach, adjuvant therapy should be administered if final pathologic findings suggest they are at risk for disease recurrence.

IMRT has been shown to decrease hematologic and gastrointestinal side effects in retrospective studies, though we await publication of the TIME-C trial (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] 1203), which randomized postoperative patients with endometrial or cervical carcinoma to IMRT or four-field pelvic radiation. (See <a href=\"#H618915858\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of high-risk disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Although limited data suggest that chemoradiation may improve the risk of recurrence, it remains unclear whether this will translate into an OS benefit.

Traditionally, treatment has been delivered using a four-field technique, which employs equally weighted anteroposterior-posteroanterior (AP-PA) and opposed lateral beams. With conventional 2D RT, radiation field borders and design were described relative to skeletal anatomy. With the use of 3D imaging, 3D conformal RT plans should be designed to adequately cover soft tissue regions at risk, including nearby parametrial and vaginal tissue and the pelvic lymph nodes. It is important to take into account variations in patient anatomy and postsurgical changes.</p><p>It is necessary to adequately cover all locoregionally draining lymphatics, which include obturator, internal iliac, presacral, external iliac, and common iliac lymph nodes (and para-aortics if at sufficient risk for disease) through the vessel coalescence at the inferior vena cava, which roughly corresponds to a superior field border at the L4-L5 disk space. Inferiorly, the field edge should extend 3 to 4 cm below the lowest extent of disease or to the bottom of the obturator foramen. The lateral margin should be set 1.5 to 2 cm lateral to the pelvic brim or at the lateral edge of the planned target volume (PTV) contours and is designed to give a margin on the pelvic vessels and lymphatics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78210\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78210 \">image 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major prognostic factors affecting survival among women with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are stage, nodal status, tumor volume, depth of cervical stromal invasion, and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI).</p><p>Disease stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113542 \">table 1</a>) is the most important prognostic factor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64747\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64747 \">table 3</a>), followed by lymph node status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. After radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy, women with stage IB or IIA disease who have negative pelvic lymph nodes have a five-year survival of 88 to 96 percent, compared with 50 to 74 percent for those with similar-stage disease and pelvic nodal metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].

The main goal of surveillance is early detection of those recurrences that might be amenable to potentially curative therapy. Surveillance should consist of a history and examination, and pelvic examination. We also perform a Pap test in patients who underwent radical hysterectomy. The use of Pap tests after radiation therapy (RT) is associated with a high number of false-positive results. Imaging should be reserved for patients with symptoms of recurrence.
