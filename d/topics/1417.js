It is especially critical that lip lacerations are repaired correctly to preserve the cosmetic appearance and functionality of the lip. When interacting with people, our vision is immediately directed towards the eyes and lips highlighting the aesthetic importance of lip structure. The lip also serves a critical role in speech articulation, food ingestion, and tactile sensation. Most lacerations can be repaired by the emergency clinician; however, there are rare circumstances where specialist referral may be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H22780687\" class=\"local\">'Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6949438\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lip is a unique structure in the body and in cross section is composed of three layers: the mucosal layer (within the oral cavity), the middle muscular layer (orbicularis oris muscle), and the outer mucosal layer consisting of the wet vermillion (internal oral) and the dry vermillion (external oral) or the &quot;red lip&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60055\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60055 \">figure 1</a>). The cosmetic outline of the lip where the facial skin meets the vermillion is referred to as the vermillion border. Aesthetically the vermillion border is crucial as light reflects at this juncture and misalignment by 1 mm will cause a noticeable scar.</p><p>The blood supply to the lip arises from the superior and inferior labial arteries which are branches of the facial artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71766\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71766 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>The lip is innervated by the infraorbital and inferior alveolar nerves which arise from the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52850 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6949445\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most instances, lip lacerations result from isolated trauma. However, as for all trauma patients, the initial clinical assessment should focus on rapid identification of potentially fatal conditions. For victims of major trauma, there should be immediate evaluation for airway compromise (while maintaining cervical spine immobilization) including the presence of midface (LeFort) injuries and dental or jaw fractures with oral hemorrhage, impaired breathing, hemorrhagic shock, and altered level of consciousness. Systematic evaluation helps ensure that potentially life-threatening injuries are promptly detected. </p><p>The approach to the injured child or adult is discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 4</a>).

If available, Panorex imaging can be used for isolated mandibular fractures, dental fractures, or fractures of the alveolar ridge instead of CT.

Local wound inoculums of 100,000 bacteria per gram of tissue are sufficient to cause wound infection. Although irrigation with normal saline has not been shown to decrease rates of infection, the authors and others still perform irrigation of lip lacerations to enhance removal of gross contaminants within the wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-and-management-of-lip-lacerations/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The suggested volume of irrigation solution is approximately 50 to 100 mL per centimeter of laceration.

However, debridement of lip lacerations and oral wounds should not routinely be performed by emergency clinicians because it distorts the original architecture and alters the cosmetic appearance.

The cosmetic outline of the lip where the facial skin meets the vermillion is referred to as the vermillion border. Aesthetically the vermillion border is crucial as light reflects at this juncture and misalignment by 1 mm may cause a noticeable cosmetic defect. (See <a href=\"#H6949438\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lip lacerations require careful evaluation to determine the location and depth of the wound, whether the laceration involves the vermillion border or extends entirely through the lip, or is associated with significant trauma to the midface, dentition, or mandible. (See <a href=\"#H6949445\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical specialty consultation, if available, is appropriate for crush wounds, wounds with large defects, and wounds with associated tooth avulsion, dental extrusion or lateral displacement with malocclusion, mandibular fracture, or LeFort fracture. (See <a href=\"#H22780687\" class=\"local\">'Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary closure (ie, wound repair at the time of presentation) is the preferred treatment for most lip lacerations. Wounds with obvious signs of inflammation (redness, warmth, swelling, pus drainage) should not be closed primarily. Lip laceration repair should also <strong>not</strong> delay further evaluation and definitive care of more urgent traumatic injuries, including underlying midface or jaw injuries. (See <a href=\"#H22780704\" class=\"local\">'Indications for primary closure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22780712\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications and precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional nerve blocks are the anesthetic method of choice for lip laceration repair. Direct infiltration of local anesthetic into lip lacerations should be avoided, as this can distort the lip tissue making it more difficult to complete an optimal cosmetic repair. Infraorbital (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77549\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77549 \">figure 5</a>) and mental nerve blocks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64720\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64720 \">figure 6</a>) anesthetize the skin and mucosal surfaces of the upper and lower lips respectively. If the laceration crosses the midline, bilateral nerve blocks should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H22780728\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia and analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral and perioral wounds are contaminated wounds. Although irrigation with normal saline has not been shown to decrease rates of infection, the authors and others still perform irrigation of lip lacerations to enhance removal of gross contaminants within the wound. The suggested volume of irrigation solution is approximately 50 to 100 mL per centimeter of laceration. Antiseptics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, povidone-iodine solution (Betadine&reg;), or hydrogen peroxide, should be avoided because they are cytotoxic and can cause tissue injury. The clinician should not shave facial hair near the laceration. Debridement of lip lacerations and oral wounds should not be performed by inexperienced clinicians because it distorts the original architecture and alters the cosmetic appearance. The presence of crushed, devitalized or necrotic tissue is a potential indication for surgical specialty consultation.
