Yet the traditional treatment model for addiction has emphasized intensive treatment for medically supervised withdrawal from <span class=\"nowrap\">substances/stabilization,</span> followed by time-limited outpatient care. In recent years, public and private health care systems and clinicians have begun recognizing that chronic or relapsing addiction, like chronic physical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension, typically requires continuing, long-term care. &#160;</p><p>Continuing care for addiction includes routine assessment and treatment customized to the needs and preferences of the individual patient. The patient&rsquo;s clinical status and risk of relapse are monitored systematically. The intensiveness of treatment is adjusted as the addiction waxes and wanes over time. Patients receive training in self-management skills and linkage to other sources of professional and community support.</p><p>This topic describes the implementation of continuing care in chronic or relapsing addiction and strategies for treatment resistant patients. Other topics describe indications for continuing care in addiction, components of continuing care, and the efficacy of multimodal continuing-care interventions; treatment issues specific to individual substance use disorders (SUDs); and determining the appropriate level of care for patients with SUDs.

Below we describe our general, initial approach to care for patients with three levels of substance use disorder (SUD) severity, consistent with DSM-5 subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-implementation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is an absence of research evidence of the optimal frequency and duration of continuing care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-implementation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; the suggestions below are based largely on our clinical experience. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy#H195601702\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuing care for addiction: Indications, features, and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>These initial continuing care plans are proposed for the patient who remains abstinent as care proceeds through successively less intensive levels of care. The frequency and duration of the latter stages of continuing care would be adjusted based on the patient&rsquo;s response to earlier stages. A patient who has a poor response to initial treatment or has repeated relapses, for example, will need longer continuing care at a higher intensity than the patient who responds well to treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111698510\"><span class=\"h3\">Low intensity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have received treatment for a mild SUD are not typically candidates for continuing care, but should be monitored for 12 months and offered additional treatment if they fail to maintain their initial improvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111698524\"><span class=\"h3\">Moderate intensity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a moderate SUD and one or more co-occurring problems (such as poor sleep or insufficient family support for recovery) would receive continuing care consisting of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intensive outpatient treatment (IOP) for one to two months, followed by </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weekly counseling sessions for at least another four to six months, followed by</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Monthly check-ins for six months </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Less frequent check-ins thereafter</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111698595\"><span class=\"h3\">High intensity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are physically dependent on alcohol or drugs, have a severe SUD, or have an SUD with an active co-occurring psychiatric disorder may require: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inpatient or residential treatment to address withdrawal and achieve initial abstinence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IOP three times per week for one to two months, followed by </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outpatient treatment one to two times per week for four to six months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monthly check-ins for six months and less frequent check-ins thereafter</p><p/><p>Research indicates that for patients receiving outpatient treatment, the first few weeks are critical for determining the optimal intensity of continuing care. In three clinical trials of continuing care for patients with DSM-IV diagnoses of alcohol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cocaine dependence, patients who are able to stop using alcohol and drugs during the first weeks of IOP were more likely to do well with less intensive continuing care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-implementation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Patients who continued using the substances were likely to require more intensive continuing care. The failure to achieve other early treatment goals &mdash; such as committing to abstinence, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, developing better coping behaviors and increased confidence in their efficacy, and identifying reliable sources of social support &mdash; may indicate a need for more intensive continuing care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-implementation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469993527\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal components of SUD treatment in continuing care are addiction counseling and mutual help groups. The use of these and other treatment components are described briefly below in the context of implementing continuing care, and in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy#H202097389\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuing care for addiction: Indications, features, and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Treatment modalities'</a>.)</p><p>In general, a patient with a less severe SUD can begin continuing care at a lower intensity; the type of treatment selected is less important. If the patient deteriorates, then a more structured, evidence-based approach is warranted. Higher severity patients should start with the most structured and evidence-based program available. If such a patient fails in that kind of continuing care, the clinician should switch to a different approach.</p><p>Selection among treatment components is subject to patient preference. Use of mutual help groups should always be stressed for more severe patients; however if the patient is adamant about not going to, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous, further pressure from the clinician may be counterproductive. Availability of some treatments (eg, certain medications and therapists trained in specific forms of psychotherapy) varies geographically and is based on patients&rsquo; health insurance and other resources. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469993428\"><span class=\"h3\">Addiction counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of continuing care provided in community-based clinics and rehabilitation programs consists of group counseling based on a 12-step approach.

Finding physicians who are well trained in this or similar models of addiction care can be difficult in many geographic areas.</p><p>Primary care clinicians without specialized training in continuing care can participate in such care for selected patients, such as milder patients who are doing well, or check-ins with patients with more severe SUDs who have successfully completed more intensive continuing care.</p><p>Although a number of research studies supported the efficacy of primary care for the provision of continuing care for SUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-implementation/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], a 2013 large trial did not generate positive outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/continuing-care-for-addiction-implementation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The patient&rsquo;s clinical status and risk of relapse are monitored systematically. The intensiveness of treatment is adjusted as the addiction waxes and wanes over time. Patients receive training in self-management skills and linkage to other sources of professional and community support.
