Estimates of the proportion of patients with psoriasis who develop psoriatic arthritis range from 7 to 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Psoriatic arthritis is characterized by stiffness, pain, swelling, and tenderness of the joints and their surrounding ligaments and tendons (dactylitis and enthesitis). The course of psoriatic arthritis is variable and unpredictable ranging from mild and nondestructive joint involvement to a severe, debilitating, erosive arthropathy. </p><p>In the majority of patients, cutaneous manifestations of psoriasis precede joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The severity of the skin disease usually does not correlate with the severity of arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is discussed in greater detail separately.

Obesity is typically defined as a body mass index (BMI) &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-prevalence-screening-and-evaluation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Body mass index'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H896792\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The findings of a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published between 1980 and 2012 support an increased prevalence of obesity in patients with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The pooled odds ratio [OR] for obesity for patients with psoriasis compared with a control group without psoriasis was 1.66 (95% CI 1.46-1.89). Additional support for a link between psoriasis and obesity stems from a review of more than 10,000 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis enrolled in clinical trials of biologic therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The average BMI for patients in the trials reviewed was 30.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>.</p><p>Studies have also identified a correlation between obesity and the severity of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/3,5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,9</a>]. In the systematic review and meta-analysis described above, the risk for obesity was more pronounced in patients with severe psoriasis (pooled OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.63-3.05) than patients with mild psoriasis (pooled OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17-1.82) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In particular, a study of 4065 individuals with psoriasis and 40,650 controls that was included in the meta-analysis illustrated a progressive relationship between disease severity and obesity. Among patients with mild (&le;2 percent body surface area [BSA]), moderate (3 to 10 percent BSA), and severe psoriasis (&gt;10 percent BSA), the prevalence of obesity compared with controls increased by 14, 34, and 66 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Children are not exempt from the increased risk for obesity observed in the setting of psoriasis. In an international cross-sectional study of 409 children with psoriasis, children with psoriasis were significantly more likely to be obese (BMI &ge;95<sup>th</sup> percentile) than controls (OR 4.29, 95% CI 1.96-9.39) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similar to the general population of patients with psoriasis, a correlation between disease severity and obesity was observed. Children with severe psoriasis had a greater increase in risk for obesity than children with mild disease (OR 4.92, 95% CI 2.20-10.99 versus 3.60, 95% CI 1.56-8.30). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455518\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than one factor may contribute to the association between obesity and psoriasis. Although the negative psychosocial impact of psoriasis was initially considered the sole reason for excess weight in patients with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], newer data suggest that obesity may increase risk for this disease. As an example, increased adiposity and weight gain were identified as strong risk factors for psoriasis in an analysis of data collected from almost 80,000 women in the Nurses' Health Study II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Compared with women with a BMI of 21.0 to 22.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> at age 18, the multivariate relative risk for the development of psoriasis for subjects with a BMI &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> at the same age was 1.73 (95% CI, 1.24-2.41), and only 0.76 (95% CI, 0.65-0.90) for women with a BMI &lt;21 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. In addition, a retrospective study of 27 overweight or obese children with psoriasis found that 93 percent were overweight or obese prior to the onset of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A pathophysiologic explanation for the link between obesity and psoriasis has not been definitively established. Growing evidence supports the designation of psoriasis as a systemic inflammatory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and the status of obesity as a proinflammatory state may be a relevant factor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a major proinflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], is found at increased levels in obesity and is produced by adipose tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Additional cytokines and bioactive products produced by adipose tissue (also known as adipokines or adipocytokines), such as interleukin (IL)-6, leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] might also stimulate psoriasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H896835\"><span class=\"h2\">Implications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the effects of weight loss on disease severity in psoriasis are limited. The first randomized trial designed to explore the effect of weight loss on the severity of psoriasis (n = 60) found a statistically nonsignificant trend towards greater improvement in psoriasis (as assessed by Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] score) in overweight or obese psoriasis patients who were placed on a low-energy diet compared with a similar group of patients who continued to eat ordinary healthy foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The median baseline PASI score for all patients (5.4) correlated with mild to moderate psoriasis, and during the 16-week trial, patients allocated to the low-energy diet lost a mean of 15.8 kg compared with a mean loss of 0.4 kg in the control group. By study end, PASI scores were reduced by a mean of 2.3 in the low-energy diet group compared with only 0.3 in the control group. In addition, improvement in the Dermatology Quality of Life Index (a secondary outcome measure aimed at assessing the change in the impact of psoriasis on patient quality of life) was significantly greater in the low-energy diet group.</p><p>Improvement in psoriasis following gastric bypass surgery has been documented in case reports and a retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/15,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18-20</a>]. The mechanism of this is unclear, but may be related to alterations in the production of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory adipokines, increased production of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1, a gut-derived hormone), or weight-loss related changes in cutaneous microflora that result in the elimination of an antigenic stimulant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/15,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21</a>]. However, worsening of psoriasis has also been reported to occur after weight loss and weight loss surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Further study is necessary to explore the effect of weight loss on psoriasis. </p><p>Obesity may impact the efficacy of some psoriasis treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A cohort study of approximately 2400 patients receiving systemic therapy for psoriasis (including conventional and biologic agents) found that compared with individuals with a BMI of 20 to 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> obese subjects (BMI &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> were less likely to achieve 75 percent improvement in disease severity (odds ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.49-0.79 at 16 weeks) regardless of the type of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, in a randomized trial of 61 obese patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, weight loss improved the response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The weight-based dosing regimen for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, a newer treatment option for psoriasis, is used to mitigate the reduction in drug efficacy observed when the standard dose is utilized in obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H896745\"><span class=\"h1\">METABOLIC SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The criteria used to identify this syndrome vary. One of the most widely used definitions of the metabolic syndrome is derived from the National Cholesterol Education Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III). According to a 2005 update of the NCEP ATP III criteria, the presence of three or more of the following elements constitutes a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated waist circumference (men &ge;102 cm, women &ge;88 cm)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated blood pressure (&ge;130 mm Hg systolic or &ge;85 mm Hg diastolic) or receiving drug treatment for elevated blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated fasting glucose (&ge;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or receiving drug treatment for elevated blood glucose </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated triglycerides (&ge;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or receiving drug treatment for elevated triglycerides</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced high density lipoprotein levels (&lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in men and &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in women or individuals receiving drug treatment for low HDL cholesterol). </p><p/><p>The metabolic syndrome is reviewed in greater detail separately.

In a population-based cohort study based upon data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, the incidences of arrhythmias were 15.41 per 1000 person-years among patients with psoriasis and 11.06 per 1000 person-years among patients without psoriasis (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.29-1.39) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Slightly greater risk for arrhythmia was detected among psoriasis patients with psoriatic arthritis (adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.22-1.74) than among psoriasis patients without psoriatic arthritis (adjusted HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.28-1.39). Chronic inflammation in psoriasis is postulated to contribute to an increased risk for arrhythmia; however, a mechanism for this observation remains to be confirmed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46164139\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been detected in patients with psoriasis. In an Israeli case-control study of 12,500 adults with psoriasis and approximately 24,000 controls, COPD was slightly more prevalent among patients with psoriasis (6 versus 4 percent; adjusted odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].

A retrospective study of data from a health insurance database in Taiwan found a higher risk for parkinsonism among 4885 patients with psoriasis than among 24,425 controls (adjusted hazard ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.35-2.20). Whether chronic inflammation in psoriasis can contribute to neurologic damage resulting in the development of parkinsonism is unclear.

In addition, a population-based study that included over 12,000 United States citizens and controlled for comorbidities found an association between psoriasis and major depression (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.41-3.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. </p><p>Severe manifestations of depression may occur; in a study of 217 patients with psoriasis, approximately 10 percent of patients reported a desire to be dead and 5 percent reported active suicidal ideation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. Because the clinical severity of skin disease does not always correlate with the emotional toll of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/120,123,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,123,137</a>], clinicians should remain cognizant that even patients with mild psoriasis may experience significant emotional distress related to the disease. </p><p>Psychological distress may impair the response to psoriasis therapies. For example, in a cohort of psoriasis patients treated with PUVA, pathologic or high-level worry was a significant predictor of time required to achieve disease clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1025661\"><span class=\"h1\">ALCOHOL ABUSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the prevalence of alcohol use and abuse among patients with psoriasis are limited. Epidemiologic studies performed in Scandinavia have found increased consumption of alcohol and an increased prevalence of alcoholism among individuals with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/139,140\" class=\"abstract_t\">139,140</a>].</p><p>Additional studies suggest that alcohol consumption may contribute to the development of psoriasis. A Finnish study demonstrated that alcohol consumption prior to the onset of skin disease was greater in men with psoriasis (n = 144) than in 285 unmatched male controls who had other skin diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. In addition, an analysis of data from over 82,000 women in the Nurses' Health Study found that when compared with women who did not drink alcohol, women who consumed 2.3 or more drinks per week were more likely to develop psoriasis (relative risk 1.72, 95% CI 1.15-2.57) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. </p><p>The mechanism through which alcohol consumption might contribute to psoriasis is unknown.

Excess alcohol consumption has been linked to more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>], and may have inhibitory effects on the response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. Additional study is necessary to evaluate the relevance of alcohol ingestion in psoriasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H611197457\"><span class=\"h1\">SMOKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking increases the risk of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, myocardial infarction and death. A meta-analysis of prevalence studies of smoking with psoriasis revealed a strong association with both current smoking (pooled odds ratio 1.78, 95% CI 1.52-2.06) and former smoking (pooled odds ratio 1.62, 95% CI 1.33-1.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. Patients with a history of smoking were also more likely to develop new onset psoriasis (odds ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.27-1.52). Moreover, current smokers were almost twice as likely to develop psoriasis as non-smokers (odds ratio 1.93, 95% CI 1.64-2.28), and there was a possible dose-effect of smoking intensity and duration on psoriasis incidence. These studies demonstrating both an increased prevalence and incidence of smoking in patients with psoriasis, along with numerous adverse cardiovascular risks of smoking, support the concept that strong recommendations for smoking cessation should be given to psoriasis patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529381285\"><span class=\"h1\">MIGRAINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There may be an association between psoriasis and migraine.

Adjusted incidence rate ratios for migraine in patients with mild and severe psoriasis were 1.37 (95% CI 1.30-1.45) and 1.55 (95% CI 1.29-1.86), respectively. The study also found increased risk for migraine among patients with psoriatic arthritis, demonstrating an adjusted incidence rate ratio for migraine in patients with psoriatic arthritis of 1.92 (95% CI 1.65-2.22). In contrast, a Taiwanese population-based study of 1685 adults with psoriasis and 5055 control subjects without psoriasis did not find an association between migraine and psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3467131\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recognition of psoriasis as a systemic inflammatory disease associated with increased risk for multiple other disorders supports the implementation of a comprehensive approach to the management of patients who present with this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. In an attempt to optimize the evaluation and management of patients with psoriasis, some academic medical centers have developed multidisciplinary clinical programs for patients with psoriasis in which professionals such as rheumatologists, cardiologists, primary care clinicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, nutritionists, and others work together in a structured manner to manage these patients. </p><p>Studies of the clinical value and cost-effectiveness of multidisciplinary clinical programs will be useful for determining the clinical value and cost-effectiveness of this approach.
