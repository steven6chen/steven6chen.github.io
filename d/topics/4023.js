Parkinson disease is uncommon in people younger than 40, and the incidence of the disease increases rapidly over 60 years, with a mean age at diagnosis of 70.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>While PD has traditionally been considered a motor system disorder, it is now recognized to be a complex condition with diverse clinical features that include neuropsychiatric and other nonmotor manifestations in addition to its motor symptomatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An accurate diagnosis of PD rests on the clinician's ability to recognize its characteristic signs and associated symptoms, especially in the early stages.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations of PD. The diagnosis and treatment of PD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-management-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic management of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149298288\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of Parkinson disease is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDINAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardinal features of PD are tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. A fourth feature, postural instability, is commonly mentioned, although it does not generally occur until much later in the course of the disease and is thus not included in any published diagnostic criteria for PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The severity of motor symptoms appears to be an independent predictor of mortality in patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tremor in PD, typically described as &quot;pill-rolling,&quot; is a rest tremor, meaning that it is most noticeable when the tremulous body part is supported by gravity and not engaged in purposeful activities. Tremors in other conditions, such as essential tremor or multiple sclerosis, are typically action tremors, in which the tremor occurs when the affected limb is being used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tremor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tremor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is not unusual for a parkinsonian tremor to be present with postural maneuvers or with action, but in such cases, the tremor is typically much more severe at rest. Because parkinsonian tremor decreases with purposeful action, it is usually the least disabling of the cardinal manifestations. However, when the tremor is severe, it can be difficult to distinguish a primary resting tremor from a primary action tremor. Some patients with PD may have a re-emergent tremor: a postural tremor that manifests after a latency of several seconds and has a frequency typical of the rest tremor in PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This distinction is important, as patients with PD who have a re-emergent postural tremor may be misdiagnosed as having essential tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The tremor of early PD is most often intermittent, and may not be noticeable to others. In fact, about half of patients with PD report a sensation of internal tremulousness in the limbs or body that is unrelated to the presence of observable tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, as the disease progresses, tremor usually becomes evident.</p><p>In the clinical setting, tremor in the limbs can be seen when the patient is relaxed with the hands resting quietly on the lap. Distracting the patient by asking him or her to perform mental calculations or voluntary repetitive movements of the contralateral limb often accentuates a mild tremor and may uncover a latent tremor. A resting hand tremor may be present only during the gait evaluation.</p><p>The frequency of the tremor in PD is between 3 and 7 Hz, and most often is between 4 and 5 Hz [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Tremor is the presenting symptom in approximately 70 to 80 percent of patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], and the percentage of patients with tremor at some point in the course of the disease is high, ranging from 79 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/16,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-21</a>]. Tremor usually starts unilaterally in the hand, and then spreads contralaterally several years after the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The side that is initially affected tends to be the more affected side throughout the course of the disease.</p><p>The tremor of PD can also involve the legs, lips, jaw, and tongue, but rarely involves the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/15,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,23</a>]. Anxiety, emotional excitement, or stressful situations can exacerbate the tremor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bradykinesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bradykinesia is a generalized slowness of movement, and is present at onset of PD in approximately 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It is arguably the major cause of disability in PD and is eventually seen in almost all patients. While it is the most common feature in PD, it is also the most difficult symptom for patients to describe. &quot;Weakness,&quot; &quot;incoordination,&quot; and &quot;tiredness&quot; are often used to describe the decreased ability to initiate voluntary movement.</p><p>In the arms, bradykinesia typically starts distally with decreased manual dexterity of the fingers. Patients often complain of difficulty performing simple tasks, such as buttoning clothes, tying shoelaces, double clicking a computer mouse, typing, or lifting coins from a pocket or purse.</p><p>In the legs, common complaints related to bradykinesia when walking include dragging the legs, shorter (shuffling) steps, or a feeling of unsteadiness. Patients may also have difficulty standing up from a chair or getting out of a car. As the disease progresses, gait freezing and festination may develop. James Parkinson defined festination as &quot;an irresistible impulse to take much quicker and shorter steps, and thereby to adopt unwillingly a running pace&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Clinical examination of bradykinesia includes evaluation of limb movements on each side of the body. The speed, amplitude, and rhythm of finger tapping, hand gripping, pronation-supination hand movements, and heel or toe tapping should be carefully observed. In mild PD, these tasks usually show some slowing and decreased amplitude when observed for more than a few seconds. As the disease progresses movements become less coordinated, with frequent hesitations or arrests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rigidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rigidity is an increased resistance to passive movement about a joint and occurs in approximately 75 to 90 percent of patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. Rigidity, like tremor and bradykinesia, often begins unilaterally, and typically on the same side as the tremor if one is present. Rigidity eventually progresses to the contralateral side, and remains asymmetric throughout the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Cogwheel rigidity can be seen in PD, and the term refers to a ratchety pattern of resistance and relaxation as the examiner moves the limb through its full range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This phenomenon is thought to be a manifestation of tremor superimposed on increased tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, not all patients with PD have cogwheel rigidity; many instead will have lead-pipe rigidity, a tonic resistance that is smooth throughout the entire range of passive movement.</p><p>Rigidity can affect any part of the body, and may contribute to complaints of stiffness and pain. Features, such as the striatal hand (extension of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints with flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joints), decreased arm swing with walking, and the typical stooped posture, result, at least in part, from rigidity.</p><p>At the bedside, rigidity is tested by passively manipulating the limbs. It can be brought out by having the patient perform repetitive maneuvers using the contralateral limb or by performing mental arithmetic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Postural instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postural instability is an impairment of centrally-mediated postural reflexes that cause a feeling of imbalance and a tendency to fall with a significant risk of injury. Because postural instability usually does not appear until later in the course of PD, patients with parkinsonian signs who fall early in the course of the illness most likely have another parkinsonian syndrome, such as progressive supranuclear palsy or multiple system atrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease#H130394006\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Postural instability is tested clinically with the &quot;pull&quot; test, where the examiner stands behind the patient and firmly pulls the patient by the shoulders. Patients with normal postural reflexes should be able to maintain balance and retropulse (step backward) no more than one step. Patients with PD and postural instability, on the other hand, are likely to fall or take multiple steps backwards.</p><p>Initially, a positive pull test may be the only sign of balance impairment. However, as postural instability progresses, the gait may show signs of festination. Once postural reflexes are lost, patients are generally wheelchair-bound.</p><p>Among the primary motor features of PD, postural instability is the least responsive to dopaminergic therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, postural instability and gait difficulty are major contributors to disability in patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SUBTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some investigators have postulated that the rate of disease progression in PD varies for certain clinically defined subgroups or subtypes of PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>The major subtypes are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tremor-dominant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Akinetic-rigid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postural instability and gait difficulty</p><p/><p>Several studies have compared the tremor-dominant subtype with either the akinetic-rigid or the postural instability and gait difficulty subtypes, and most have found that the tremor-dominant subtype was associated with slower progression and less neuropsychologic impairment than the other two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/31-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-37</a>].</p><p>While some clinicians may find these groupings useful, clinical PD progression is unfortunately variable, and subtypes can change in an individual as the disease progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Thus, there are currently no symptoms or signs in idiopathic PD that allow a practitioner to accurately predict the future course of PD for any given individual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER MOTOR FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the cardinal manifestations just discussed, there are a number of other motor features seen in PD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81338\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81338 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Craniofacial</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypomimia (masked facial expression)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased spontaneous eye blink rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Speech impairment, including hypokinetic dysarthria, hypophonia, and palilalia (repetition of a phrase or word with increasing rapidity)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dysphagia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sialorrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blurred vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impaired contrast sensitivity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypometric saccades</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impaired vestibuloocular reflex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impaired upward gaze and convergence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eyelid opening apraxia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Micrographia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dystonia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Myoclonus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stooped posture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Camptocormia (severe anterior flexion of the thoracolumbar spine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pisa syndrome (subacute axial dystonia with lateral flexion of the trunk, head, and neck) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Kyphosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Scoliosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Difficulty turning in bed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gait</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shuffling, short-stepped gait</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Freezing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Festination</p><p/><p>Most of these features result from one or more of the cardinal manifestations. As examples, decreases in spontaneous associated movements, such as loss of gestures during conversation, decreased eye blinking, or facial masking, probably result from a combination of bradykinesia and rigidity. Dysphagia is due to bradykinesia of the pharyngeal musculature, which can lead to pooling of saliva in the mouth and drooling (sialorrhea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PD has traditionally been considered a motor system disorder, but it is now widely recognized to be a complex disorder with diverse clinical features that include neuropsychiatric and nonmotor manifestations in addition to its motor symptomatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>].

Nonmotor symptoms in the psychiatric domain occurred most frequently. Psychiatric symptoms such as psychosis or dementia may cause more disability than the motor features and may be more difficult to treat. In a single center survey of 265 patients with PD, pain, mood disorders, and sleep problems were the most troublesome nonmotor symptoms occurring in both early and late stage PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>In some patients, certain nonmotor features of PD (eg, olfactory dysfunction, constipation, depression, and REM sleep behavior disorder) may present before the motor ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most clinically relevant nonmotor manifestations of PD will be reviewed here individually.</p><p>The management of nonmotor symptoms of PD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-nonmotor-symptoms-in-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive dysfunction and dementia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive dysfunction and dementia are common in PD, and the presence of dementia appears to be an independent predictor of mortality in PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In community-based studies, the prevalence of dementia in PD is as high as 41 percent, and in longitudinal studies, the cumulative incidence of dementia in PD is as high as 78 percent. Older age and severity of PD motor symptoms are consistently associated with an increased risk of developing dementia in prevalence and incidence studies. Later age of onset of PD, longer duration of PD symptoms, the presence of hallucinations, depressive symptoms, and a family history of dementia may also be risk factors for dementia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The dementia of PD is classically considered a subcortical dementia, with psychomotor retardation, memory difficulty, and altered personality. Patients with PD typically report problems with executive function (decision making or multi-tasking), memory retrieval, and visuospatial misperception. Deficits in executive functioning are often the earliest indicators of disturbed cognition. This is in contrast to Alzheimer disease (AD), the prototypical cortical dementia, with features of aphasia and apraxia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The anatomic and pathologic basis of Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) is not fully understood. Neuropathologic studies have shown that patients with PD and dementia have a mixture of cortical neuronal Lewy inclusion bodies filled with alpha synuclein and the signature amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of AD. However, the degree of Lewy body pathology (Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites) correlates better with cognitive decline and dementia than does the degree of Alzheimer pathology, which is relatively modest in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Neuropathology'</a>.)</p><p>Dementia usually occurs late in the course of PD. Complicating the diagnosis of dementia in PD is the entity of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). This illness is characterized primarily by dementia, but it also has parkinsonian features, visual hallucinations, and fluctuating cognition. Because of the overlapping clinical as well as pathological similarities (Lewy bodies in the limbic cortex and neocortex) between DLB and PD with dementia, many experts believe the two conditions may be two ends of the same disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinically, patients are diagnosed with PD dementia if their illness begins with PD and they develop dementia at least a year after the onset of parkinsonian motor symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cognitive-impairment-and-dementia-in-parkinson-disease#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>When dementia begins before or concurrently with parkinsonian motor symptoms, DLB is the more likely diagnosis.

Auditory, olfactory, and tactile hallucinations also occur in PD, although less frequently, and generally in conjunction with visual hallucinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/50,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,53</a>]. The prevalence and severity of hallucinations increase over time in patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations&quot;, section on 'Neurodegenerative disease'</a>.)</p><p>When psychosis occurs, it is attributable to the underlying Lewy body disease, to antiparkinson drug therapy, or a combination of the two. All antiparkinsonian medications have been reported to induce psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>], yet certain drugs are more likely than others to cause psychotic symptoms. For example, large trials of dopamine agonists have demonstrated that visual hallucinations are more likely to result from these agents than levodopa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Psychotic symptoms may persist but generally resolve when PD medications are discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, the duration or dose of anti-parkinsonian drug therapy correlates poorly with the severity of psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Delusions can also be a prominent feature of psychosis in PD, and are usually paranoid in nature. Common delusions include spousal infidelity, people stealing money, intruders living in the house, or nurses planning harmful plots. Many patients with PD who have psychotic symptoms nevertheless retain the insight that their hallucinations are not real. However, patients with PD can also be delirious or demented and manifest psychosis as a result. The patients in this latter category tend to be less responsive to treatment.</p><p>Studies have shown that psychosis, not motor dysfunction, is the single greatest risk factor for nursing home placement in patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Psychosis is also associated with increased caregiver burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>] and an increased risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/10,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,64</a>]. Commonly reported risk factors for psychosis in PD include the use of high doses of antiparkinson drugs, the presence of dementia, advancing age, impaired vision, depression, presence of sleep disorders, high comorbid disease burden, and longer disease duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/51,60,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,60,65,66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Mood disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression, anxiety, and abulia or apathy are mood disorders that occur most often in patients with PD.

The psychomotor slowing and blunted affect commonly seen with depression often resemble the bradykinesia and masked facial expression seen in PD. Furthermore, somatic features of depression, such as decreased appetite, difficulty with concentration, and sleep disturbances, are commonly seen in patients with PD who do not have depression.</p><p>Patients with PD who develop depression usually present with sadness, anhedonia, and decreased interest in activities. Guilt and feelings of worthlessness may occur less frequently in PD-related depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Suicide occurs at approximately the same rate in PD as in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>], but suicide rates may be increased after deep brain stimulation.

Depression and anxiety are often comorbid conditions in PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]; they are also associated with &quot;on-off&quot; fluctuations, with worsened mood and anxiety during &quot;off&quot; periods, and with improvement when in the &quot;on&quot; state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Apathy and abulia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apathy has been defined as a primary loss of motivation, characterized by diminished speech, motor activity, and emotional expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. This definition of apathy is essentially synonymous with that of abulia, which has been defined as a loss of the impulse, will, or motivation to think, speak, and act. Diminished motivation is the key concept in both apathy and abulia. The neurologic basis of apathy and abulia is most commonly ascribed to frontal lobe and limbic system dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>].</p><p>While apathy frequently accompanies depression, it can occur in patients with PD who do not have depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>].

Tremor may also contribute to sleep fragmentation. The rest tremor in PD disappears with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but recurs during light sleep and may awaken the patient as a result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Some patients may have painful dystonia, especially of the legs, that typically occurs in the early morning and disrupts sleep.

RLS is a movement disorder characterized by an urge to move the limbs, associated with an unpleasant sensation that occurs mainly or exclusively at night, emerges or worsens with rest, and improves with movement, especially walking. The prevalence of RLS in patients with PD is uncertain, as data are inconsistent. Furthermore, the prevalence of RLS in PD is difficult to assess because of overlapping clinical features between RLS and PD, such as wearing-off symptoms related to levodopa therapy, and akathisia (a state of motor restlessness characterized by the inability to sit or lie still). These issues are reviewed separately.

The symptoms of PLMS are typically slow rhythmic movements of the legs, consisting of dorsal flexion of the foot and great toe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In some patients, flexion of the knee and hip may also occur.

This disorder is characterized by vigorous movements that are related to increased muscle tone during REM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Patients with RBD often act out their dreams and exhibit vocalizations as well as flailing, kicking, and punching motions of the limbs. Some patients may injure themselves or their bed partners. Behaviors related to RBD are reported to occur in 15 to 47 percent of patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/104,106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,106,107</a>], and over three-quarters of spontaneous RBD cases eventually develop PD or other alpha-synucleinopathies, often years after the onset of RBD.

These problems are also present in multiple system atrophy (MSA), making it difficult to distinguish the two disorders. The autonomic symptoms in MSA, however, are generally more severe than in PD. Furthermore, MSA tends to be less responsive to levodopa as the disease progresses, and MSA is often associated with cerebellar and pyramidal findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple system atrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Orthostatic hypotension can occur in up to 58 percent of patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease/abstract/129,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130</a>] and can be aggravated or caused by antiparkinsonian agents including levodopa, dopamine agonists, and MAO-B inhibitors.
