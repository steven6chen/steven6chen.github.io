The level of evidence to guide the clinician in initiating chelation therapy is quite variable as shown by the following examples in disorders associated with iron overload:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myelodysplasia</strong> &ndash; Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and refractory anemia who are &ge;70 years of age may have a life expectancy similar to that of an age- and sex-matched normal population, with reduced survival for those who are transfusion-dependent.
