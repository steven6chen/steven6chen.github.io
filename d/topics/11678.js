Common systemic manifestations include fatigue, constipation, cold intolerance, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, and hoarseness. A variety of central and peripheral nervous system manifestations are common in patients with hypothyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72975 \">table 1</a>). In many cases, the neurologic manifestations occur in conjunction with the systemic features of the disease and may be noted only incidentally. However, symptoms and signs of neurologic dysfunction may be the presenting feature in some patients and can contribute significant disability. Most of these complications are partially or fully responsive to thyroid replacement.</p><p>This topic reviews the common neurologic manifestations of hypothyroidism. Other clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism are discussed separately.

The severity of the impairment depends upon the severity and duration of <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> hypothyroidism. Although the effects of postnatal hypothyroidism can be ameliorated by prompt treatment, the sequelae of gestational hypothyroidism, particularly in the first trimester, persist throughout life. One cause of hypothyroidism in neonates is maternal and infant iodine deficiency, which is still endemic in some parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world.</p><p>Neurologic sequelae include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intellectual disability </strong>&ndash; The severity of cognitive impairments is associated with both the degree and duration of thyroid (or iodine) deficiency in utero and early life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Severe deficiency in the first trimester of pregnancy in particular is associated with severe irreversible intellectual as well as motor impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Even children exposed to mild degrees of iodine deficiency in gestation and those with postnatal congenital hypothyroidism that is promptly recognized at birth are likely to have mild, often subclinical, neuropsychiatric deficits when compared with siblings and other control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Studies suggest that in postnatal hypothyroidism, earlier administration of higher-dose thyroxine (T4) treatment is associated with less severe deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impaired motor development</strong> &ndash; Severe gestational and postnatal hypothyroidism are associated with dysfunction of pyramidal and extrapyramidal motor systems. Typical deficits include rigidity and spasticity of the trunk and proximal extremities, with relative sparing of the distal arms and legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Neuroimaging studies have revealed calcification in the basal ganglia and subcortical areas on computed tomography (CT), as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal abnormalities in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Up to 40 percent of children and adolescents with congenital hypothyroidism have been shown to demonstrate mild findings of cerebellar dysfunction, such as intention tremor, difficulty with tandem gait, clumsy running, fine motor dysfunction, and unsteady stance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The findings were more prominent in those diagnosed with hypothyroidism during the first few months of life compared with those diagnosed after the first year of life. A delay to treatment also influences the severity of findings in these children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Patients present with altered consciousness ranging in severity from confusion and lethargy to coma, usually in conjunction with hypothermia and other symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism (hypotension, bradycardia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and hypoventilation). Seizures are common. </p><p>Myxedema coma is a medical emergency with a high mortality rate. This topic is discussed separately.

Decreased cerebral blood flow and decreased cerebral oxygen and glucose metabolism as seen on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron-emission tomography (PET) studies have been implicated in some patients, but not in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Animal studies suggest that hypothyroidism can produce alterations in the synaptic plasticity of neural pathways mediated by the dorsal hippocampus, which are important for many higher cognitive functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Mild cognitive impairment in hypothyroidism may be mediated by anxiety and depression, both of which have been linked to hypothyroidism. Depression and anxiety can impair attention and executive function, the same cognitive spheres that are most often and earliest affected in hypothyroidism. Studies of post-thyroidectomy patients who undergo induced hypothyroidism (for the purpose of thyroid cancer assessment) find that patients exhibit symptoms of anxiety and depression with proportionate disturbances in attention and executive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features and associations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Overt hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive dysfunction is a common feature of overt hypothyroidism (low serum free thyroxine [T4], elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), occurring in 66 to 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Cognitive impairment in hypothyroidism is most often manifest by slowed mentation, poor concentration, and decreased short-term memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>]. Also common are social withdrawal, psychomotor retardation, depressed mood, and apathy. Cortical features (aphasia, apraxia) are generally absent. Less commonly, hypothyroidism presents with other neuropsychologic symptoms including psychosis, confusion, and disorientation; this syndrome has been called &quot;myxedema madness.&quot;</p><p>When neuropsychologic testing is performed, deficits may be most pronounced in tests of attention and executive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/13,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20-23</a>]. Memory retrieval, learning, verbal fluency, and motor speed are also often particularly impaired. Electroencephalography (EEG) may show generalized background slowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Cognitive change in overt hypothyroidism is commonly accompanied by other clinical features associated with this condition, including lethargy, fatigue, cold intolerance, dry skin, constipation, and decreased exercise tolerance. These symptoms may occur concurrently with or precede cognitive decline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Subclinical hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined biochemically as a normal serum free T4 concentration in the presence of an elevated serum TSH concentration. This is in contrast with overt hypothyroidism, which is characterized by a low free T4 concentration. Despite its name, subclinical hypothyroidism may occur with mild symptoms of hypothyroidism; however, these are typically vague and nonspecific in this setting. </p><p>Subclinical hypothyroidism is common in the adult population, occurring in 4 to 15 percent; the prevalence rises with age and is higher in females than males. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Investigations of the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and dementia or cognitive impairment have had somewhat conflicting results, due in part to whether the study was cross-sectional or followed patients over time and the types of cognitive testing employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/21,23-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23-35</a>]. In the aggregate, as summarized by a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis, there is no convincing evidence that cognitive impairment or dementia is associated with subclinical hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Despite this, there may be a rationale for treating patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and significant cognitive impairment as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Alzheimer disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies have suggested that thyroid disease may be a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>], but the bulk of evidence does not support an etiologic relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/37,39-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39-45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Hashimoto encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune or Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas of the world. Hashimoto encephalopathy describes a syndrome of altered mental status and seizures that occurs in individuals with serologic manifestations of Hashimoto thyroiditis. Unlike the syndromes described above, the clinical manifestations are believed to result from autoimmunity, not from hypothyroidism. This topic is discussed separately.

However, the degree of recovery is variable and may be incomplete in patients with more severe and longer duration of hypothyroidism. Cognitive recovery may also be delayed for several months following a return to a euthyroid state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Studies that report either no or limited improvement often had short follow-up times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/20,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,49</a>]. The treatment of hypothyroidism is discussed separately.

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 94 patients, aged 65 years and older with subclinical hypothyroidism, demonstrated no significant improvement in Mini-Mental State Examinations and other tests of cognition following six months of thyroid replacement; however, only one subject was cognitively impaired at baseline, and there was a high dropout rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In smaller studies, replacement with T4 led to objective <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subjective improvements in memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. Several uncontrolled trials have also indicated that a significant improvement in attention, memory, verbal fluency, and executive functions occurs with thyroid replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/21,35,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,35,51</a>]. Most of these patients were not demented. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While these studies are not conclusive, we suggest a treatment trial with thyroid replacement for most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and measured cognitive impairment. Arguments against treatment include the risks of overtreatment as well as possibly inducing cardiac symptoms in susceptible patients. Treatment should be stopped in patients who don't appear to have a clinical benefit. Other aspects of management including other indications for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism are discussed separately.

Because identification of hypothyroidism may be masked by PD, some suggest that thyroid function studies be performed in patients with PD who do not respond to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p>Testing for hypothyroidism may be complicated in the setting of PD. L-dopa suppresses the thyrotropin-releasing hormone response.

In small case series of patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism, clinical signs of CTS were present in 25 to 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]; an even higher proportion may have electrodiagnostic signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In the majority of these patients, the findings were bilateral. No correlation between the severity of hypothyroidism and the presence of CTS has been reported.

The highest associations between CTS and hypothyroidism were in studies of patients undergoing surgical therapy, suggesting that hypothyroidism may be associated with more severe CTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathology</strong> &ndash; The pathogenesis of CTS in hypothyroidism is believed to be due to mucinous infiltration of the perineurium and endoneurium of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. Mucopolysaccharide protein complexes with synovial thickening have been identified in tendons and synovial sheaths.

Most studies associating hypothyroidism in CTS do not indicate whether the diagnosis of hypothyroid disease was made before or after the diagnosis of CTS. One study that did so reported that 13 of 18 hypothyroid diagnoses were made after presentation with CTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment</strong> &ndash; A number of clinical observations report clinical and electrodiagnostic improvement or resolution of the CTS following thyroid replacement and return to a euthyroid state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/75,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,87,88</a>]. With thyroid replacement, symptoms may improve within weeks to months. However, one study found that among 21 treated patients with hypothyroidism, symptoms and electrophysiologic signs of CTS were common (73 and 29 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Unsystematic observations suggest that a longer duration of CTS prior to treatment is associated with poorer response to hormone replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other treatments used in CTS, such as wrist splinting, corticosteroid injection, and surgical carpal tunnel release, are also options in these patients, although they have not been well studied in hypothyroid-related CTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Since improvement with return to the euthyroid state is common, surgical intervention is often unnecessary and should probably await a treatment trial of hormone replacement.

In various studies of mostly newly diagnosed hypothyroidism, distal sensory complaints occur in 29 to 64 percent, clinical signs of polyneuropathy are seen in 25 to 42 percent, and electrophysiologic evidence of polyneuropathy is reported in 17 to 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/74,75,90-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75,90-92</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathogenesis</strong> &ndash; The pathogenesis of the hypothyroid neuropathy is incompletely understood.

Others propose a primary axonal pathology with secondary demyelination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/93,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,96</a>]. Hypothyroidism may affect slow axonal transport due to a disturbance in microtubule assembly, thereby contributing to nerve damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> &ndash; The most common clinical manifestation of hypothyroid neuropathy is a sensory disturbance in a symmetric, distal-predominant distribution, affecting the feet earlier and more severely than the hands. Sensory loss, tingling, and painful dysesthesias are common complaints. Findings on neurologic examination include loss or reduction of deep tendon reflexes and a symmetric &quot;stocking-glove&quot; distribution of sensory loss. Delayed relaxation of the reflexes is a characteristic feature of hypothyroidism. Rarely, in more severe cases, distal weakness and atrophy may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The onset and duration of neuropathic symptoms is generally correlated to the onset and duration of hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. However, symptoms of neuropathy may be present for years before the diagnosis of hypothyroidism is made. The severity of neuropathic symptoms does not directly correlate with the degree of thyroid deficiency, but may be associated with the duration of hypothyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrophysiology</strong> &ndash; Various findings on NCS have been reported, including low-amplitude or absent sensory nerve action potentials, mild slowing of motor and sensory conduction velocities, and mild prolongation of distal motor latencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/84,93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,93,94</a>]. These findings suggest a combination of axonal and demyelinating features (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;</a>). These abnormalities can be seen in patients with subclinical as well as overt hypothyroidism and in patients without symptoms of neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A subset of patients with hypothyroidism complains of typical neuropathic pain, but have normal NCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. This suggests that some patients may have an isolated small fiber polyneuropathy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> &ndash; The presence of distal sensory loss and reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes suggests a sensory polyneuropathy in a patient with known hypothyroidism. Electrophysiologic tests help to confirm as well as characterize the polyneuropathy. There are no specific clinical or electrophysiologic features that distinguish hypothyroid polyneuropathy from neuropathy due to other causes. In one report, skin biopsy demonstrated a reduction in the intraepidermal nerve fiber density in neurologically asymptomatic patients with overt or subclinical hypothyroidism; the clinical utility of this evaluation is not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment and prognosis</strong> &ndash; Hormone replacement is effective in the treatment of hypothyroid polyneuropathy. With a return to euthyroid state, clinical and electrophysiologic improvement occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/75,84,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,84,100</a>]. In one case series, NCS normalized in four of seven patients examined three months after initiation of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

These likely reflect an underlying predisposition to autoimmune disease. The presence of progressive weakness and prominent demyelinating features (conduction block) on NCS should suggest these diagnoses. It is important to consider and recognize these syndromes, as the appropriate treatment is immunosuppressive therapy, rather than thyroid replacement alone.

The hearing loss is usually sensorineural rather than conductive.
