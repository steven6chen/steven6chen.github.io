The known genetic causes of these syndromes derive from defects in proteins of the innate immune system, although many patients do not have mutations diagnostic of known genetic autoinflammatory disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The most common of these conditions with no known genetic defect is <strong>p</strong>eriodic <strong>f</strong>ever, <strong>a</strong>phthous stomatitis, <strong>p</strong>haryngitis, and <strong>a</strong>denopathy (PFAPA) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p>PFAPA is one of two truly predictably periodic fever syndromes. The other is cyclic hematopoiesis, which has indistinguishable clinical features. PFAPA is a sporadic syndrome, unlike most hereditary autoimmune fevers, and second cases in siblings are rare. This topic reviews the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of PFAPA. An overview of the periodic fevers and other autoinflammatory diseases is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pediatrician is generally the first clinician to evaluate the child with recurrent fever since these disorders often become clinically apparent in childhood. The approach to a child with unexplained fever is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Etiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic fever in children diagnosed with PFAPA generally begins between the ages of two and five years (3.7&plusmn;3.8 years of age in the Israeli cohort of &gt;500 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,10</a>], although a younger median age of onset (11 months) was seen in a smaller Norwegian cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There is a slight male predominance (55 to 71 percent). There is no predilection for a particular ethnic or racial group. Familial cases are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p>Attacks cease before 10 years of age in most patients. However, this syndrome has been described in adults. The first cases in adults were reported in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], with over 50 cases diagnosed since then [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In one cohort, the age of onset was &lt;18 years of age in most cases. The mean age at onset was older (25.9&plusmn;8.3 years) in one published series of 17 adults with PFAPA syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PFAPA syndrome is among the most common autoinflammatory syndromes in children. While most of these syndromes have a monogenic pattern of inheritance, no genetic basis or inheritance pattern in PFAPA is known.</p><p>Known monogenic causes of periodic fevers have been excluded as the cause of PFAPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A comprehensive genetic study on 68 individuals from 14 families failed to show any pattern of inheritance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Exome sequencing revealed the absence of any gene that was mutated in all patients. In a series of 1200 PFAPA patients, only five families reported two siblings with PFAPA. Whole exome sequencing failed to identify any variants that could be associated with PFAPA syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, other studies suggest a portion of PFAPA cases are familial. In one case-control study, 18 of 80 PFAPA case subjects had &ge;1 family member with PFAPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, both parents and siblings of cases were more likely than family members of controls to have recurrent pharyngitis or aphthous stomatitis, which suggests these disorders represent reduced penetrance phenotypes of PFAPA. Overall, these results suggest that PFAPA is caused by oligogenic or complex inheritance of variants in multiple disease genes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nongenetic factors (eg, shared environmental exposures). Further characterization of the genetics and inflammatory profiles of these patients and their relatives is warranted.</p><p>The striking response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below) suggests that dysregulated production of cytokines may contribute to the fevers. Elevations of several inflammatory cytokines, most notably interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-18, occur during episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/5,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22,23</a>]. IFN-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10, also called CXCL10 for chemokine, CXC motif, ligand 10), monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG, or CXCL9), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are increased after the onset of fever, while IL-7 and IL-17 are suppressed during afebrile and febrile periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Proinflammatory mediators (eg, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-12p70) may even be elevated between febrile attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Cellular responses are also generally distinct from those seen in infections, where cytokine patterns are mostly associated with a release of primarily proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-gamma, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). In contrast, inflammation is derived from activation of the innate immune system in PFAPA. Monocytes are increased, and eosinophils and lymphocytes are often decreased during febrile episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Platelets are increased in the afebrile interval. Complement, IL-1-related, and IFN-induced genes are overexpressed during PFAPA attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These changes imply activation of innate immunity, resulting in increased IL-1 beta secretion and precipitation of attacks. Increased IL-1 beta secretion is commonly found in autoinflammatory syndromes, suggesting similar pathogenic mechanisms between this group of diseases and PFAPA syndrome. A model was proposed in which microbial triggers activate a cascade beginning in the innate immune system and culminating in recruitment of activated T cells to the periphery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The remarkable similarity between uncomplicated episodes of cyclic neutropenia and febrile attacks in PFAPA suggest that they share common pathways of immune dysregulation and may involve a &quot;biologic clock.&quot; Cyclic neutropenia is thought to be due to mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene (<em>ELA2</em>), resulting in a perturbed interaction between neutrophil elastase and serpins or other substrates that regulate the clocklike timing of hematopoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A genetic defect has not been identified in patients with PFAPA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclic-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclic neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alternative theories to explain the periodicity of the PFAPA syndrome include intermittent expression or suppression of antigens or epitopes of infectious agents or an alteration in the nature or kinetics of the immunologic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, lack of second cases in siblings or other close contacts, lack of seasonal or geographic clustering, and the progression-free duration of PFAPA for years weigh against an infectious etiology. In addition, histology and electron microscopy of specimens collected from tonsils removed from patients with PFAPA were unrevealing, and deep cultures were negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, in another study, the presence and relative abundance of specific bacterial microbiota of the tonsils removed from patients with PFAPA were significantly different from the tonsillar microbiota of the controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These findings suggest that the tonsillar microbiota play a role in triggering&nbsp;the autoinflammatory processes that cause PFAPA.</p><p>Increased numbers of class-switched immunoglobulin D-positive and immunoglobulin M-negative (IgD+IgM-) plasmablasts and more mucosal IgD-armed basophils were found in patients with PFAPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Furthermore, an increased proportion of these cells and IgD class-switched plasmablasts were demonstrated in tonsil tissue specimens from PFAPA patients, suggesting that microbial antigens with IgD-binding activity may trigger release of IL-1 beta and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) from mucosal basophils, resulting in inflammation. This effect could account for the persistent elevated serum IgD, immunoglobulin G (IgG), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) titers often observed in individuals with periodic fever syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/6,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,28,29</a>].</p><p>The course of PFAPA syndrome is attenuated in patients with a single mutation in <em>MEFV</em>, the familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. PFAPA attacks in carriers of <em>MEFV </em>mutations were shorter and less likely to occur at regular intervals, and fewer patients had oral aphthae compared with patients without these mutations. A lower glucocorticoid dose was needed to abort the attacks in these patients as well. No differences were observed in other clinical and laboratory parameters. These data suggest that, in PFAPA, <em>MEFV</em> is a modifier gene associated with an attenuated disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Abdominal pain was reported by 45 to 60 percent but was never sufficiently severe to warrant surgical consultation. Diarrhea, arthralgia, cough, coryza, and rash were reported to a much lesser degree in the United States cohort and not at all in the Israeli cohort.

A child was diagnosed at the age of eight years as having PFAPA on the basis of recurrent attacks of fever with aphthous ulcers, pharyngitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy at variable intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. He had an apparent remission after tonsillectomy. However, as an adult he had attacks that included conjunctivitis, myalgia, flank, and abdominal pain in addition to pharyngitis and oral ulcers. These attacks lasted one to two weeks. At age 22 years he was diagnosed with tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) by genetic analysis. As pointed out in an editorial that accompanied the instructive case report, the childhood episodes had neither the periodicity nor the short duration that define PFAPA attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Most patients with cyclic neutropenia exhibit a 21-day cycle (range 14 to 35 days) compared with the 28-day (range 26 to 30) cycle for PFAPA, and the period is consistent within each patient. Patients may develop acute, extensive gingival disease compared with the more limited and intermittent aphthous ulcers seen in PFAPA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclic-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclic neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Recurrent fevers that are not periodic suggest hyper-immunoglobulin D (hyper-IgD) syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), or Muckle-Wells syndrome. A screening panel for mutations in seven genes that cause periodic fever syndromes is available through at least one reference laboratory.

An infectious disease or malignancy is rarely diagnosed in an individual who has predictably periodic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>A formula to help decide when to test a patient for mutations in genes associated with periodic fevers is available and is reviewed in greater detail separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This formula, the Gaslini diagnostic score, is based upon the results of genetic testing in 393 patients with periodic fevers. Higher frequencies of abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cutaneous rash, and arthralgia were seen in children with identifiable genetic explanations for their fevers. Genetically negative patients, on the other hand, had a higher frequency of exudative pharyngitis. This study supports our criteria and also validates the recommendation that genetic analysis needs be considered only in children who do not fulfill the criteria for PFAPA.

Given the favorable natural history, treatment of any kind is clearly optional, and the risks of symptomatic treatment must be weighed against adverse effects. Nearly half of children are not treated for febrile episodes on a regular basis. Clinical experience suggests that antipyretics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are ineffective in controlling the symptoms of PFAPA other than fever.

Questions to be considered in this decision include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can the child afford to miss four to five days a month of school?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can a parent or caregiver miss work to care for a febrile child?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does familial stress related to the illness justify the potential risk of treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H417372785\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We opt for observation if the patient and family wish <strong>not</strong> to treat, given that PFAPA is a self-limited disease with no long-term sequelae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112469\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112469 \">algorithm 1</a>). If the patient and family wish to treat episodes, we use oral glucocorticoids since treatment of PFAPA episodes with moderate doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> is effective in nearly all patients. Many parents worry about the potential side effects of glucocorticoid therapy. However, toxicity related to the low doses of glucocorticoids used in PFAPA, aside from possible restlessness and changes in mood on the days of administration of the drug, have not been reported in either the United States or Israeli cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The one significant complication noted with glucocorticoid treatment is an increase in the frequency of episodes. A trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">colchicine</a> is an option in these patients since treatment with colchicine is associated with an increased interval between episodes. For those patients and families who wish to try to prevent episodes rather than treat them as they occur, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cimetidine</a> is an option.

Some experts prefer treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a>, which they have found to be more effective in their clinical experience, although published data are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Prednisone treatment may result in shortening of the interval between attacks.

Many children suffered attacks as frequently as weekly for a few months before the frequency changed back to monthly despite continued administration of glucocorticoids at the onset of all episodes. For patients who do not revert to monthly episodes with ongoing glucocorticoid treatment, skipping a dose can cause a return to the previous rate of episodes. However, parents are often reluctant not to treat, due to suffering of the child during episodes.</p><p>In patients who have responded to a test dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> and whose caregivers wish to treat episodes, subsequent episodes may be treated with a single dose of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/prednisolone</span> 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> at fever onset. The dose is tapered (eg, decrease prednisolone by 3 mg or betamethasone 0.5 mg) with each episode until the last effective dose is reached (a dose is too small when fever recurs two to three days following administration of the glucocorticoid; fever recurring after one week should be considered a new episode).

However, patients continue to have episodes, and, in the author's experience, the effect of colchicine is short lived, and the drug has failed in a large number of cases.

All of these patients were being treated with glucocorticoids. The patients were followed for an average of two years (range 6 to 48 months). In eight of nine patients, treatment with colchicine was associated with an increased interval between episodes (the average interval increased from 1.7 to 8.4 weeks). In two patients, discontinuation of colchicine was associated with an increased frequency of episodes.

Supplementation with vitamin D during the winter months led to a decrease in the number and duration of febrile episodes.</p><p>At one center, prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">montelukast</a> 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for a period of three months resulted in a significant reduction in the frequency of episodes in up to 80 percent of the over 30 patients treated who suffered from weekly episodes of PFAPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Formal peer review of this data and further studies are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PFAPA syndrome is a disease of unknown etiology and uncertain pathogenesis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It usually presents in childhood and is characterized by periodic fevers at regular intervals of four to six weeks and by stereotypical clinical features of pharyngitis, aphthous ulcers, and cervical adenitis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PFAPA is based upon clinical criteria and the exclusion of other causes of recurrent fevers. In addition, a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> given at the onset of fever can be used as a diagnostic tool. Fever and pharyngitis resolve within a matter of hours but may recur in 48 to 72 hours. Clinical features that <strong>exclude</strong> PFAPA include the presence of neutropenia before or during an episode, the presence of atypical symptoms (ie, cough, coryza, severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, arthritis, or neurologic deficits) in association with most episodes, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) between attacks, impaired growth, or a family history of recurrent fever. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PFAPA is a self-limited disease with no long-term sequelae. A decision to treat PFAPA is based upon severity and duration of episodes, impact on quality of life, and preference of the child and their caregivers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112469\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112469 \">algorithm 1</a>). Effective education of caregivers may allow expectant management of febrile episodes without use of potentially toxic medications or surgery. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <span class=\"nowrap\">patients/families</span> who opt for episodic treatment and the patient has responded to an initial test dose of glucocorticoid, subsequent episodes may be treated with a single dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a></span> (starting dose 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> maximum dose 60 mg) or, if available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">betamethasone</a> (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> maximum dose 9 mg) at the onset of fever. The dose is tapered (eg, decrease prednisolone by 3 mg or betamethasone 0.5 mg) with each episode until the last effective dose is reached (a dose is too small when fever recurs two to three days following administration of the glucocorticoid). Treatment of episodes is continued until the patient stops having episodes or the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> wishes to do a trial off of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Episodic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Colchicine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cimetidine</a> are infrequently used daily therapies that may decrease episode frequency or lead to remission, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H1989978241\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of patients with a decreased episode interval after glucocorticoid therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Preventive treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tonsillectomy is effective in some patients with PFAPA. However, PFAPA is a benign and self-limited disease, and tonsillectomy has attendant significant risks. In addition, up to one-third of patients who undergo tonsillectomy can have a recurrence of PFAPA months to years later. Thus, tonsillectomy is reserved for patients with PFAPA who fail to respond to conservative management and who still wish to pursue treatment. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Tonsillectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periodic-fever-with-aphthous-stomatitis-pharyngitis-and-adenitis-pfapa-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Reiman HA.
