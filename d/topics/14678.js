It can happen at any age, but is most common in people between 40 and 60. It is more common in women than in men.</p><p>PG is more common in people with certain conditions. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digestive system diseases, such as Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood diseases and blood cancers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis</p><p/><p>Healthy people can also get PG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30389338\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of PG?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first symptom is usually a raised bump or blister. It might be filled with fluid or pus. It can spread out and form an open sore (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F85576\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85576 \">picture 1</a>). The edges sometimes look purple. PG blisters and sores can be very painful.</p><p>The symptoms of PG are most common on the legs. But bumps, blisters, and sores can also happen on other parts of the body. A person who had a colostomy can get PG around the opening called the &quot;stoma&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57774\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57774 \">figure 1</a>) where bowel movements leave the body. A few people get PG inside the body, but this is very rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30389353\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful bumps or blisters</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open sores that do not heal quickly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30389368\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It can be hard to tell for sure if someone has PG without doing tests. That's because many other conditions cause similar symptoms. The doctor or nurse will learn about your symptoms, do an exam, and order tests. The tests can check for diseases people with PG often have, or show if you have a condition that is not PG.</p><p>Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called a &quot;biopsy&quot; &ndash; In this test, a doctor takes a sample of tissue from the area with a blister or sore. Another doctor looks at the tissue under a microscope for signs of PG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; These can show if you have one of the conditions that people with PG often have.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called a &quot;colonoscopy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>) &ndash; During a colonoscopy, the doctor inserts a tube and a tiny camera into your anus and up to your colon. He or she can check your colon for signs of Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30389394\"><span class=\"h1\">How is PG treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescription creams</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pills you take by mouth - If one medicine does not work, your doctor can try something else.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An injection (shot) of medicine around the area with PG</p><p/><p>People with PG might need more than 1 treatment at a time. For example, doctors might prescribe a cream to put on the area and pills to take by mouth. Or a person might take 2 different types of pills.</p><p>Sometimes doctors prescribe medicines called &quot;biologics.&quot; One example is a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">infliximab</a>. These medicines seem to help some people with PG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30389409\"><span class=\"h1\">Can PG be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors do not yet know how to prevent PG. But if you already have it, avoiding cuts or scrapes could help prevent new blisters or sores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30389423\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PG takes several months or years to go away completely, so you might need treatment for a long time. When PG heals, it usually leaves scars. It can also come back later. Be sure to tell all of your doctors and nurses that you had PG. If you find new sores, bumps, or blisters, talk to a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30389438\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blisters-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blisters (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Crohn disease in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ulcerative colitis in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Crohn disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ulcerative colitis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
