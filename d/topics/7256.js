The flow-volume loop (also called a spirogram) is a plot of inspiratory and expiratory flow (on the Y-axis) against volume (on the X-axis) during the performance of maximally forced inspiratory and expiratory maneuvers.</p><p>The normal expiratory portion of the flow-volume curve is characterized by a rapid rise to the peak flow rate, followed by a nearly linear fall in flow as the patient exhales toward residual volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63544\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63544 \">figure 1</a>). The inspiratory curve, in contrast, is a relatively symmetrical, saddle-shaped curve. The flow rate at the midpoint of exhalation (between total lung capacity and residual volume) is normally approximately equivalent to the flow rate at the midpoint of inspiration.</p><p>Changes in the contour of the loop can aid in the diagnosis and localization of airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Characteristic flow-volume loop patterns are also often found in certain forms of restrictive disease, although flow-volume studies are not considered primary diagnostic aids in the evaluation of these disorders.</p><p>An overview of flow-volume loops will be presented here. A general review of pulmonary function testing, including the indications for spirometry, is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A frequently recognized abnormality in the flow-volume loop is the concave upward or &quot;scooped-out,&quot; or &quot;coved&quot; pattern encountered in asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55880\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55880 \">figure 2</a>). Maximal expiratory flow rates during the latter two-thirds of an expiratory maneuver are largely effort independent (ie, flow cannot be accelerated by increased expiratory effort), and vary directly with the elastic recoil of the lung and inversely with the airway resistance upstream of the equal pressure point.</p><p>Two changes are present in emphysema that will reduce flow rate during this phase of respiration: the elastic recoil of the lung is decreased due to loss of lung parenchyma; and airway resistance is increased due to secretions, bronchospasm, or loss of small airways.</p><p>The concave upward appearance of the flow-volume loop in obstructive lung disease probably results from the following two factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compression of the major central airway with a precipitous decline in flows. This process is often referred to as <strong>negative effort-dependence</strong> and results in premature airway closure. This may be more prominent in patients with emphysema, and is due to loss of airway support from the tethering effect of the surrounding parenchyma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A disproportionate decrease in flow later in expiration. Specifically, the heterogeneity of lung disease results in the more rapid and earlier emptying of areas with higher elastic recoil or lower airway resistance, compared to the slower emptying of more diseased areas.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of flow-volume loops for detection of obstructing lesions of the upper airway (defined as that portion of the airway extending from the mouth to the lower trachea) was first reported by Miller and Hyatt, who described three distinct patterns: variable extrathoracic obstruction; variable intrathoracic obstruction; and fixed obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The upper airway is divided into intra- and extrathoracic components by the thoracic inlet, which projects 1 to 3 cm above the suprasternal notch on the anterior chest at the level of the first thoracic vertebra.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Variable extrathoracic obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This flow-volume loop pattern is also known as dynamic or non-fixed extrathoracic obstruction. The pattern consists of a truncation of the envelope of the maximal <strong>inspiratory</strong> curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 3</a>). During thoracic expansion with inspiration, the combination of atmospheric extraluminal pressure and negative (subatmospheric) intraluminal pressure results in decreased luminal size of the extrathoracic portion of the upper airway, thus accentuating the effect of any obstructive lesion in this region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65386\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65386 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Turbulent flow and a Venturi effect also contribute to the drop in intratracheal pressure, producing further narrowing and flow limitation. In addition, the ratio of expiratory to inspiratory flow at 50 percent vital capacity, FEF (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent)/FIF</span> (50 percent), is elevated, with an average value of 2.2 (normal ratio: 1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Diseases that exhibit this pattern include laryngomalacia and tracheomalacia of the extrathoracic trachea, as well as structural or functional vocal cord abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paradoxical vocal fold motion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Variable intrathoracic obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This pattern, also known as dynamic or non-fixed intrathoracic obstruction, demonstrates truncation of the envelope of the maximal <strong>expiratory</strong> curve, resulting from expiratory flow limitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 3</a>). The pleural pressure surrounding the intrathoracic trachea is negative relative to the intratracheal pressure during inspiration, thereby producing no restraint to inspiratory airflow. In contrast, flow limitation is encountered during forced expiration, when the pleural pressure becomes positive relative to airway pressure, and the effect of any obstructive lesion in this region is accentuated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55931 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>Once again, turbulent flow and a Venturi effect may result in a further drop in airway pressure, leading to airway narrowing and flow limitation. The FEF (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent)/FIF</span> (50 percent) ratio is reduced, with an average value of 0.32 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This pattern may occur with tracheomalacia of the intrathoracic airway, bronchogenic cysts, or with tracheal lesions, which are often malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Additional findings in the context of structural or anatomic intrathoracic lesions include notching of the expiratory flow volume loop in the absence of cough, with a brief mid-expiratory dip in flow seen in 9 percent of subjects with tracheobronchomalacia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and an early expiratory notch in a patient with a glomus tumor of the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Fixed upper airway obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Firm tracheal lesions may limit the modulating effect of transmural pressures on airway luminal diameter. In this pattern, flow is limited during both <strong>inspiration and expiration</strong>, with flattening of both limbs of the flow-volume loop. An FEF (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent)/FIF</span> (50 percent) ratio close to 1 (average 0.9) has been observed as a characteristic of fixed upper airway obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Dynamic narrowing of airway segments adjacent to the obstructive lesion may skew this ratio depending upon its location. One report, for example, evaluated patients with rigid thoracic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A ratio greater than 1.3 was noted in three of six patients with rigid extrathoracic lesions. Cinefluoroscopy suggested that the greater inspiratory limitation resulted from dynamic compression of the normal extrathoracic trachea between the stenotic segment and the thoracic inlet (ie, caudad to the stenosis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A ratio below 0.5 was seen in one patient with rigid intrathoracic lesion. Cinefluoroscopy confirmed that the greater expiratory limitation was secondary to dynamic narrowing of the normal intrathoracic trachea between the stenotic segment and the thoracic inlet (ie, cephalad to the stenosis).</p><p/><p>A ratio of 1 would be expected for fixed lesions at the thoracic inlet or with a noncompliant trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Examples of fixed upper airway obstruction include tracheal stenosis (as from prolonged intubation) or a goiter compressing the trachea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Extraluminal airway obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extraluminal airway obstruction may cause a pattern of fixed airway obstruction or an atypical pattern of extrathoracic obstruction. As an example, one series described the flow-volume loops of patients with bulky mediastinal adenopathy due to Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. None of these patients had evidence of extrathoracic airway involvement on computed tomographic studies. Fourteen of 25 patients (56 percent) had abnormal flow-volume loops; the abnormalities consisted of flattening of both limbs of the flow-volume loop (seven patients) or flattening of the inspiratory loop only (seven patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811 \">figure 3</a>). While the former pattern is consistent with a fixed airway obstruction, the latter is unexpected in intrathoracic disease. Moreover, the FEF (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent)/FIF</span> (50 percent) was unexpectedly elevated in all, including those with a fixed pattern of obstruction, which is more typical of extrathoracic obstruction. It is possible that the bulky mediastinal adenopathy resulted in external splinting of the airway, which may have prevented the usual dynamic changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55931 \">figure 5</a>), limiting both the narrowing of the intrathoracic airway in expiration and the widening of the airway in inspiration&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Variable obstruction at the thoracic inlet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This form of upper airway obstruction may result in a double hump (also called twin hump) of the expiratory curve as the narrowing moves from an intrathoracic to a relative extrathoracic location toward the end of expiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54799\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54799 \">figure 6</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. Interestingly, repeated flow-volume loops may show first an intrathoracic and then an extrathoracic location, as the lesion moves within the chest with neck flexion and outside the thoracic inlet with neck extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78259\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78259 \">figure 7</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Examples of such lesions include low posttracheostomy scars or strictures that may be located at or above the suprasternal notch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. A similar double hump pattern in the contour of the expiratory curve has been described in a patient with vocal cord dysfunction characterized by initial adduction and subsequent abduction of the vocal cords in mid-expiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mainstem bronchial obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several abnormalities in the expiratory flow-volume loop have been described in patients with unilateral mainstem bronchial obstruction. Total functional obstruction of a mainstem bronchus results in an apparent restrictive ventilatory pattern of the expiratory curve, reflecting the loss of function of the affected side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76796\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76796 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, a partially occluded bronchus may result in a mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80922\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80922 \">figure 9</a>). This would presumably result from initial normal emptying of the unaffected side, followed by slow emptying of the affected side. The net effect is an increasing upward concavity at lower lung volumes, as occurs with asthma or emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, these patterns may be masked in patients with underlying emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Other patterns that may be seen with differential emptying include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An end-inspiratory tail (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74178\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74178 \">figure 10</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biphasic spirogram, with an initial normal curvature of the expiratory loop and a &quot;straight line&quot; appearance at end-expiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74178\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74178 \">figure 10</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A flattening or plateau of the initial portion of the expiratory flow curve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25782803\"><span class=\"h2\">Saw-tooth pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A so-called saw-tooth pattern has been described that consists of small, rapid oscillations in flow during both expiration and inspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56090\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56090 \">figure 11</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Detecting the saw-tooth pattern is subjective and artifacts in the resonance frequency of the recording equipment can have a similar appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Conditions associated with a saw-tooth pattern on the flow-volume loop include neuromuscular diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], laryngeal dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], pedunculated tumors of the upper airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], tracheobronchomalacia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/5,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24</a>], upper airway burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The saw-tooth pattern has also been described in 31 percent of snorers without sleep apnea and in 10 percent of normal individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Among 401 patients referred for evaluation of snoring, the sensitivity and specificity of the saw-tooth pattern for OSA were 11 and 94 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Another feature of flow-volume loops sometimes seen in patients with OSA is an increased ratio of forced expiratory flow at 50 percent of vital <span class=\"nowrap\">capacity/forced</span> inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity (FEF [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent]/FIF</span> [50 percent]). Normally, the FEF [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent]/FIF</span> [50 percent] is &le;1, but in patients with sleep apnea, it is often &gt;1. When this criterion was examined in a group of 405 patients referred for evaluation of OSA, the sensitivity and specificity were 12 and 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550420979\"><span class=\"h2\">&quot;Knee pattern&quot;</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the concave inflection noted in patients with obstructive lung disease, the &quot;knee&quot; pattern is a normal variant representing a convex inflection in the expiratory portion of a flow-volume loop (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F108135\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108135 \">figure 12</a>). The prevalence of this finding on post-bronchodilator loops is 70 percent at age 18, and decreases by age 38 to 58 percent in females and 41 percent in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The convexity in the expiratory flow has been attributed to a proximal flow-limiting (choke point) section of the bronchial tree that moves distally with age due to loss of parenchymal elastic recoil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Accuracy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flow-volume loop is an <strong>insensitive</strong> test for upper airway obstruction, as lesions must narrow the tracheal lumen to less than 8 mm (a reduction of the tracheal area by at least 80 percent) before abnormalities can be detected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73686\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73686 \">figure 13</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is supported by a report that found exertional dyspnea and a precipitous decline in peak expiratory flow rate occurred with tracheal diameters under 8 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence that flow-volume loops are insensitive for detecting upper airway obstruction includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 475 flow-volume loops, the aggregate sensitivity of several quantitative and visual criteria for upper airway obstruction was 69.4 percent and the areas of the receiver operating curves for all the individual criteria were low (ie, ROC &lt;0.522) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 226 patients who underwent laryngoscopy, the accuracy of flow-volume loops for detecting vocal cord dysfunction was evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Assessment of flow-volume loops by a pulmonologist had low predictive value (ROC &lt;0.68), leading to the conclusion that a normal flow-volume loop should not preempt laryngoscopy when vocal cord dysfunction is suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an evaluation of 76 flow-volume loops in subjects with symptomatic tracheobronchomalacia, 13 (17 percent) had no flow-volume loop abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>The flow-volume loop therefore indicates the functional (rather than anatomic) severity of the obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Despite this limitation, the test is simple and readily available, so that a flow-volume loop is useful whenever an upper airway lesion is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, its poor sensitivity suggests that further evaluation (such as imaging, bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy) is warranted when clinical suspicion is high despite a preserved flow-volume loop. In a retrospective review, 4.6 percent of the studies in a pulmonary function testing laboratory had abnormalities of the inspiratory flow-volume curve (consisting of truncation, flattening or absent loop). Although only 17 percent of the identified inspiratory abnormalities were subsequently evaluated, these evaluations led to a specific etiology in 52 percent, including vocal cord dysfunction, vocal cord paralysis, and other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The authors propose anatomic and functional evaluation of the airway if more than one inspiratory curve in a pulmonary function testing session is abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-volume-loops/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Upper airway obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The upper airway is defined as that portion of the airway extending from the mouth to the lower trachea and is further divided into intra- and extrathoracic components by the thoracic inlet, which projects 1 to 3 cm above the suprasternal notch on the anterior chest at the level of the first thoracic vertebra. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Upper airway obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, the flow-volume loop is an insensitive test for upper airway obstruction, as lesions must narrow the tracheal lumen to less than 8 mm (a reduction of the tracheal area by at least 80 percent) before abnormalities can be detected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73686\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73686 \">figure 13</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Accuracy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormal inspiratory flow-volume loop should prompt a clinical assessment and review of all the flow-volume loops of the testing session. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Accuracy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristic flow-volume loop pattern of restrictive disease (seen most frequently with interstitial lung disease) is a decrease in vital capacity combined with supernormal expiratory flows when corrected for lung volume. The resulting shape of the flow-volume curve is a tall, &quot;witch's hat&quot; appearance with a steep descending limb (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55880\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55880 \">figure 2</a>).
