They are related to the severity and, in particular, the rapidity of the change in the serum sodium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Patients with hyponatremia and hypernatremia may also have complaints related to concurrent volume depletion and possible underlying neurologic diseases that predispose to the electrolyte abnormality. These include a wide variety of neurologic disorders that can lead sequentially to either the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, water retention, and hyponatremia, or to the lack of expression of thirst, which is normally the major protective mechanism against the development of hypernatremia.</p><p>The cerebral adaptation and clinical manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia will be reviewed here.

In this setting, the associated fall in serum osmolality creates an osmolal gradient that favors water movement into the cells, leading to brain edema.</p><p>The development of cerebral edema in hyponatremic patients is dependent upon the transfer of water from plasma and cerebrospinal fluid into the brain. Insight into this process is provided by studies in mice without the genes for aquaporin-4, a water channel expressed at the interface between the brain and blood and between the brain and cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Compared with wild-type mice, knockout mice exhibit considerably less brain edema, morbidity, and mortality after the induction of acute hyponatremia, suggesting that aquaporin-4 mediates a substantial portion of osmotic water transport into the brain.</p><p>Hyponatremia-induced cerebral edema occurs primarily with rapid reductions in the serum sodium concentration, usually less than 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], as most often occurs in postoperative patients given large quantities of hypotonic fluid and in patients with self-induced water intoxication due to primary polydipsia or exercise-associated hyponatremia. Hypoxic brain injury also may contribute to the neurologic deficit if respiratory arrest has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-associated-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-associated hyponatremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H238335439\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of hypoosmolality in symptom development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyponatremia is almost always associated with hypoosmolality, and it is the fall in plasma osmolality that promotes the movement of water into the cells and the possible development of cerebral edema. The contribution of hyponatremia itself to the neurologic manifestations is uncertain. This is an important issue, since there are a variety of settings in which hyponatremia is associated with a normal or high measured serum osmolality. These disorders are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Hyponatremia with a high or normal serum osmolality'</a>.)</p><p>Summarized briefly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>pseudohyponatremia</strong>, both the serum osmolality and the concentration of sodium in plasma water are normal, and patients are asymptomatic. Such patients have either hyperproteinemia or hyperlipidemia, which reduce the fraction of the plasma that is water from the normal value of 93 percent (the remaining 7 percent is due to proteins and lipids with a small contribution from dissolved solutes) to a lower value that can be less than 80 percent. In such settings, the physiologically important sodium concentration per liter of plasma water is normal, although the sodium concentration per liter of plasma is reduced. The plasma osmolality is normal because osmometers measure the activity of solutes in plasma water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With moderate to advanced <strong>renal impairment</strong> or with <strong>ethanol intoxication</strong>, hyponatremic patients may have a higher osmolality than that predicted by their sodium concentration due to the contribution of urea or ethanol in the extracellular fluid. However, urea and ethanol are ineffective osmoles since they can freely cross cell membranes and therefore do not obligate water movement out of the cells. Thus, the effective serum osmolality (measured osmolality minus the contribution of urea or ethanol) in such patients is low. As a result, hyponatremic patients with renal failure or ethanol intoxication are as likely to develop symptoms at a given serum sodium concentration as patients without these conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Advanced renal failure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with <strong>uncontrolled diabetes</strong>, the serum osmolality is typically elevated. In contrast to urea, glucose is an effective osmole since it does not freely enter cells. The increase in effective serum osmolality pulls water out of the cells and lowers the serum sodium by dilution, an effect that may be at least partially reversed by the free water loss resulting from the associated glucosuria-induced osmotic diuresis. The neurologic symptoms in these patients are <strong>not</strong> generated by the hyponatremia since the effective plasma osmolality is usually increased rather than reduced.

Only a small quantity of this solution is usually absorbed systemically. However, large amounts of the irrigant are occasionally infused by accident into veins or body cavities. Severe isosmotic hyponatremia due to dilution can result (serum sodium less than 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> which can produce neurologic symptoms. In addition to hyponatremia, glycine toxicity and the accumulation of ammonia, serine, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glyoxylate from the metabolism of glycine may contribute to neurologic manifestations.

This protective response, which begins on the first day and is complete within several days, occurs in two major steps.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial cerebral edema raises the interstitial hydraulic pressure, creating a gradient for extracellular fluid movement out of the brain into the cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The brain cells then lose solutes, leading to the osmotic movement of water out of the cells and a decrease in brain swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/4,5,12,14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,12,14-18</a>]. Brain cell potassium is lost rapidly through normally quiescent cation channels in the cell membrane that are activated by cell swelling. Subsequently, organic solutes (called organic osmolytes) are lost via swelling-activated membrane channels that also transport chloride and other anions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. Substantial depletion of brain organic osmolytes occurs within 24 hours, and additional losses occur over two to three days owing to downregulation of the synthesis and uptake of these solutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p>These processes are reversed with correction of the hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/4,5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,18</a>]. However, the reuptake of brain solutes during correction occurs more slowly than the loss of brain solutes during the onset of hyponatremia.</p><p>Organic osmolytes account for approximately one-third of the solute loss in chronic hyponatremia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71152 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Reducing the intracellular content of these solutes has the advantage of restoring cell volume without interfering with protein function. By comparison, there would be a potentially deleterious effect on protein function if the volume adaptation were mediated entirely by changes in the cell cation (potassium plus sodium) concentration.</p><p>Studies in hyponatremic animals have shown that the major osmolytes lost from the brain cells are the amino acids glutamine, glutamate, and taurine, and, to a lesser degree, the carbohydrate myoinositol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/5,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,17</a>]. A study using proton NMR spectroscopy found a slightly different pattern in humans with chronic hyponatremia; myoinositol and choline compounds were the primary organic solutes lost, with a smaller change occurring in glutamine and glutamate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Myoinositol also appears to be the primary osmolyte taken up by the brain as part of the protective response in patients with hypernatremia.

Nausea and vomiting can be ominous symptoms of life-threatening cerebral edema in patients with acute hyponatremia; by contrast, in chronic hyponatremia, these symptoms are not associated with adverse outcomes. Seizures and coma are uncommon and often reflect an acute exacerbation of the hyponatremia. Symptomatic chronic hyponatremia is rarely, if ever, associated with cerebral edema severe enough to cause herniation of the brain. In a series of 223 patients hospitalized for symptomatic chronic hyponatremia due to thiazide diuretics, there was a 1 percent incidence of seizures and no cases of herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, at the time of the study, the consequences of overly rapid correction were unknown.

Gradually raising the serum sodium with tolvaptan was associated with significant improvement on the Mental Component of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey at 30 days. This benefit was significant only in patients with a serum sodium concentration between 120 and 129 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and was not seen with correction of mild hyponatremia (130 to 134 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> or in the placebo group.

In addition to a higher risk of falls, patients with hyponatremia are more likely to have osteoporosis than patients without hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The higher prevalence of osteoporosis may be due at least in part to loss of bone sodium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Possible risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Hyponatremia, even if mild, is associated with increased mortality in both hospitalized and ambulatory patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. Mortality risk in hospitalized patients with hyponatremia is increased across virtually all clinical subgroups and persists after hospital discharge, regardless of the underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A meta-analysis of 15 studies encompassing 13,816 hyponatremic patients found that an improvement in the serum sodium concentration was associated with a decreased mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This finding likely resulted from simultaneous improvements in underlying comorbidities, rather than a cause-effect relationship between serum sodium and mortality.</p><p>However, the association between serum sodium concentration and morality in hospitalized patients is nonlinear. Several studies have found that mortality risk increases as serum sodium decreases to approximately 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L;</span> below 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> patients have lower rather than higher mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. The explanation for this paradox may be that extremely low serum sodium concentrations are most commonly drug induced, whereas mild to moderate hyponatremia is more likely to be associated with a life-threatening underlying disease (malignancy, oliguric renal failure, heart failure, or hepatic cirrhosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Similarly, drug-induced hyponatremia tends to resolve spontaneously when the drug is discontinued, while hyponatremia associated with a severe underlying disease tends to persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Hyponatremia, even if mild, is also associated with increased morbidity in hospitalized patients. As an example, in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database, the 75,423 patients with preoperative hyponatremia (sodium level of &lt;135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> compared with 888,840 patients with normonatremia had significantly higher perioperative 30-day mortality (5.2 versus 1.3 percent), major coronary events (1.8 versus 0.7 percent), wound infection (7.4 versus 4.6 percent), and pneumonia (3.7 versus 1.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Susceptibility of premenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premenopausal women and young children with acute postoperative hyponatremia may progress rapidly from minimal symptoms (headache and nausea) to respiratory arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/7,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,38</a>]. Cerebral edema and herniation have been found at autopsy, leading some authors to suggest a possible hormonally-mediated decrease in the degree of osmotic adaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/7,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,39</a>]. The observation that prepubertal boys and girls are at equal risk of symptomatic hyponatremia is compatible with the importance of sex hormones in conferring susceptibility to adult women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Other factors may play a role, such as the size of the brain in relationship to the capacity of the cranial vault, and a more rapid onset of hyponatremia because of smaller body size with less muscle to &quot;buffer&quot; the excess water.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Osmotic demyelination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adaptation that returns the brain volume toward normal in chronic hyponatremia protects against the development of cerebral edema but also creates a potential problem when the serum sodium is therapeutically or spontaneously corrected. In this setting, an overly rapid increase in the serum sodium concentration can lead to an osmotic demyelination syndrome (also called central pontine myelinolysis, although demyelination is often more diffuse and does not necessarily involve the pons). These changes can lead to potentially severe neurologic symptoms that are usually delayed for two to six days after correction and may be irreversible. Thus, patients with symptomatic hyponatremia may initially demonstrate neurologic improvement with correction of the serum sodium but then show late deterioration.

The latter response involves an initial uptake of sodium and potassium salts, followed by the later accumulation of osmolytes, which in animals consists primarily of myoinositol, the amino acids glutamine, glutamate, and taurine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. Myoinositol and taurine are taken up from the extracellular fluid via an increase in the number of sodium-myoinositol and sodium-taurine cotransporters in the cell membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]; the source of glutamine and glutamate (uptake from the extracellular fluid or production within the cells) is unknown. The net effect is that these osmolytes, which do not interfere with protein function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], account for approximately 35 percent of the new cell solute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>A report of an infant with an initial serum sodium concentration of 195 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> confirmed the general applicability of these observations to humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Assessment of symptoms attributable to hypernatremia is often difficult because most affected adults have underlying neurologic disease. The latter is required to diminish the protective thirst mechanism that normally prevents the development of hypernatremia, even in patients with diabetes insipidus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Like hyponatremia, hypernatremia, even if mild, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. A cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) compared 20,029 patients with preoperative hypernatremia (&gt;144 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> to 888,840 patients with a normal baseline serum sodium (135 to 144 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Preoperative hypernatremia was associated with increased perioperative 30-day mortality (5.2 versus 1.3 percent), perioperative major coronary events (1.6 versus 0.7 percent), pneumonia (3.4 versus 1.5 percent), and venous thromboembolism (1.8 versus 0.9 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correction of chronic hypernatremia must occur slowly to prevent rapid fluid movement into the brain and cerebral edema, changes that can lead to seizures and coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Although the brain cells can rapidly lose potassium and sodium in response to cell swelling, the loss of accumulated osmolytes and the water they obligate occurs more slowly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/5,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,52</a>]. The loss of myoinositol, for example, requires both a reduction in the synthesis of new sodium-inositol cotransporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] and the activation of a specific inositol efflux mechanism in the cell membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The delayed clearance of osmolytes from the cell can predispose to cerebral edema if the serum sodium concentration is lowered too rapidly. As a result, the rate of correction in asymptomatic patients should be less than 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. However, fear of cerebral edema from overly rapid correction of hypernatremia, which has only been reported in infants, should not deter vigorous rehydration of adults with acute hypernatremia who are at risk of developing osmotic demyelination or brain hemorrhage from untreated hypernatremia. Unlike hyponatremia, there is little risk of inadvertent overcorrection in patients with hypernatremia, and adults with hypernatremia are often undertreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/1,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,61,62</a>].

There is preliminary evidence that hyperosmolality, perhaps via stress on the cytoskeleton as the cell volume falls, activates a specific protein kinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. This kinase, via protein phosphorylation, may then lead to activation of transporters, such as the sodium-inositol cotransporter, that promote solute uptake into the cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H117803785\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Nausea and malaise are the earliest findings, and may be seen at a serum sodium concentration below 125 to 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Headache, lethargy, obtundation and eventually seizures, coma, and respiratory arrest may occur if the serum sodium concentration falls below 115 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Hyponatremic encephalopathy may be reversible or permanent. Premenopausal women appear to be at greater risk for severe hyponatremic symptoms and for residual neurologic injury.
