Nonetheless, selection of appropriate candidates for reperfusion demands a neurologic evaluation and a neuroimaging study. In addition, reperfusion therapy for acute stroke requires a system that coordinates emergency services, stroke neurology, intensive care services, neuroimaging, and neurosurgery to provide optimal treatment.</p><p>This topic will review the use of reperfusion therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke, focusing on early thrombolytic therapy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a>. The administration of intravenous alteplase for acute ischemic stroke is reviewed in detail separately.

The long-term goal is to improve outcome by reducing stroke-related disability and mortality.</p><p>There are two options for reperfusion therapy that are proven effective: intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> and mechanical thrombectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2187332181\"><span class=\"h2\">Alteplase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or tPA) is the mainstay of treatment for acute ischemic stroke, provided that treatment is initiated within 4.5 hours of clearly defined symptom onset (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 1</a>). Because the benefit of alteplase is time dependent, it is critical to treat patients as quickly as possible. Alteplase initiates local fibrinolysis by binding to fibrin in a thrombus (clot) and converting entrapped plasminogen to plasmin. In turn, plasmin breaks up the thrombus into fibrin degradation products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H938416610\"><span class=\"h3\">Benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> improves functional outcome at three to six months when given within 4.5 hours of ischemic stroke onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>].</p><p>The benefit of intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke decreases continuously over time from symptom onset, as shown in meta-analyses of randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>] and a registry that analyzed data from over 58,000 patients treated with tPA within 4.5 hours of ischemic stroke symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the registry, each 15-minute reduction in the time to initiation of tPA treatment was associated with an <strong>increase</strong> in the odds of walking independently at discharge (4 percent) and being discharged to home rather than an institution (3 percent); in addition, the same 15-minute reduction in time to tPA treatment was associated with a <strong>decrease</strong> in the odds of death before discharge (4 percent) and symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation of infarction (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A 2014 meta-analysis evaluated individual patient data from 6756 subjects (including more than 1700 subjects older than age 80 years) who were allocated to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> or control within 3 to 6 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset in the NINDS, ATLANTIS, ECASS (1, 2, and 3), EPITHET, and IST-3 trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Alteplase also increased the risk of fatal intracranial hemorrhage within seven days (2.7 versus 0.4 percent, OR 7.14, 95% CI 3.98-12.79, NNH 44); this risk was similar regardless of age, stroke severity, or treatment delay. Alteplase treatment had no significant effect on other early or late causes of death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death at 90 days was slightly higher in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> group (17.9 percent, versus 16.5 percent in the control group, hazard ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.99-1.25), a result that just missed statistical significance.</p><p/><p>In agreement with other meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1,3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,7</a>], these observations confirm that the sooner intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> treatment is initiated, the more likely it is to be beneficial, and that the benefit extends to treatment started within 4.5 hours of stroke onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The results also show that alteplase is beneficial regardless of patient age, stroke severity, or the associated increased risk of symptomatic or fatal intracranial hemorrhage in the first days after alteplase treatment. The odds of a favorable three-month outcome decrease as the interval from stroke onset to start of alteplase treatment increases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66764\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66764 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In clinical trials of intravenous alteplase, the rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were 5 to 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>], using the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) definition. In addition, most community-based studies of intravenous alteplase have shown similar rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. These studies suggest that intravenous alteplase can be used safely to treat acute ischemic stroke in routine clinical practice.</p><p>The NINDS trial definition of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage includes any hemorrhagic transformation temporally related to any neurologic worsening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], which may be overly inclusive because it captures small petechial hemorrhages associated with minimal neurologic deterioration that are unlikely to have altered long-term functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In contrast, the ECASS 2 and SITS-MOST definitions of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage includes only hemorrhage associated with substantial clinical worsening of &ge;4 points on the NIHSS stroke scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], which may be more predictive of intracerebral hemorrhages that adversely affect long-term outcome. As an example, the SITS-MOST study enrolled over 30,000 patients, mainly from Europe, who were treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> at 669 centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage by the NINDS definition occurred in 7.4 percent, and by the SITS-MOST definition in 1.8 percent.</p><p>Several risk assessment methods, including the HAT score, DRAGON score, SEDAN score, Stroke-Thrombolytic Predictive Instrument, SPAN-100 index, and the SITS SICH risk score, have been devised to predict the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prognosis for patients with acute stroke who are treated with intravenous thrombolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/14,17-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17-25</a>].

The ability to recanalize in experimental embolic stroke is related to the amount of red cells in the emboli and inversely related to the volume of emboli and to the fibrin content and density of the clots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

These include age, sex, stroke severity, and early ischemic change on CT or MRI. However, these factors do not necessarily predict which patients will or will not benefit from intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a>.

However, stroke severity alone cannot be used to select or exclude patients for intravenous thrombolysis.

Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (tPA) is the mainstay of reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke. Mechanical thrombectomy is indicated for patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by an intracranial large artery occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation. (See <a href=\"#H510877031\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> improves functional outcome at three to six months when given within 4.5 hours of ischemic stroke onset. (See <a href=\"#H2187332181\" class=\"local\">'Alteplase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke should be rapidly screened for treatment with intravenous thrombolytic therapy. Simultaneously, patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke involving the anterior circulation should be evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy. (See <a href=\"#H3301330430\" class=\"local\">'Rapid evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For eligible patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 1</a>) with acute ischemic stroke causing a potentially disabling neurologic deficit, we recommend intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> therapy, provided that treatment is initiated within 3 hours of clearly defined symptom onset (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For otherwise eligible patients who cannot be treated in less than 3 hours, we suggest intravenous alteplase therapy, provided that treatment is initiated within 3 to 4.5 hours of clearly defined symptom onset (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3923506290\" class=\"local\">'Less than 3 hours'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3115618621\" class=\"local\">'3 to 4.5 hours'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute ischemic stroke due to a proximal large artery occlusion who can be treated within 24 hours of time last known to be at neurologic baseline should be evaluated for treatment with mechanical thrombectomy.
