As a result, most uric acid circulates as the urate anion.</p><p>The vast majority of other mammalian species have extremely low serum urate levels (about 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> because uric acid is converted to allantoin, a highly soluble excretory product. By contrast, uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans, because the human homolog of the mammalian uricase (urate oxidase) gene is structurally modified to an unexpressed (pseudogene) state. Thus, normal humans have serum urate concentrations approaching the theoretical limit of solubility of urate in serum (6.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and regularly excrete urine that is supersaturated with respect to uric acid. As an example, the mean serum urate concentration was formerly reported to be between 5 and 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> among healthy adult white men in the United States, and the prevalence of hyperuricemia in this group was estimated to be at least 5 to 8 percent. However, subsequent epidemiologic data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 to 2008 indicate that hyperuricemia (as defined in that study by a single urate determination exceeding 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> is much more prevalent, occurring in up to 21.4 percent of adults in the surveyed US adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asymptomatic-hyperuricemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asymptomatic hyperuricemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The normal adult male has a total body urate pool of approximately 1200 mg, about twice that of the normal adult female. This gender difference may be explained by an enhancement of renal urate excretion in women of childbearing age due to the effects of estrogenic compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], which likely reduce the number of active renal urate transporters, resulting in lesser renal tubular uric acid reabsorption and thus increased urate clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Normally, all urate measured in the body pool is believed to be soluble urate. When insoluble urate crystal deposition occurs (in gout), body pool measurements underestimate the body urate pool. Under normal steady state conditions, daily turnover of about 60 percent of the urate pool is achieved by balanced production and elimination of uric acid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">URIC ACID PRODUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uric acid is not typically ingested; the major site of uric acid production is the liver, from the degradation of dietary and endogenously synthesized purine compounds. Dietary intake appears to provide a significant source of urate precursors, as a purine-free formula diet reduces urinary excretion of uric acid by approximately 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The urate production process (purine degradation) involves the breakdown of the purine mononucleotides, guanylic acid (GMP), inosinic acid (IMP), and adenylic acid (AMP), ultimately into the purine bases, guanine and hypoxanthine. These latter two compounds are then metabolized to xanthine. In the final step, catalyzed by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, xanthine is irreversibly oxidized to produce uric acid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F75554\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75554 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">URIC ACID DISPOSAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Under normal physiologic circumstances, metabolism of uric acid is negligible in human tissues and is limited to minor nonspecific oxidation by peroxidases and catalases. Thus, to maintain homeostasis, urate must be excreted intact by the gut and the kidney. (See <a href=\"#H291958327\" class=\"local\">'Urate metabolism in pathophysiologic circumstances'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The entry of urate into the intestine has historically been regarded as a passive process that varies with serum urate concentration. However, studies of urate transporters have provided convincing evidence that urate efflux into the gut lumen is an active process mediated by urate transporters, of which the best studied to date is ABCG2 (also called the breast cancer resistance protein or BCRP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>ABCG2 is a high-capacity urate transporter encoded by the <em>ABCG2</em> gene (chromosome 4) and expressed in intestinal epithelium as well as on the luminal surface of renal proximal tubule epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Intestinal tract bacteria are able to degrade uric acid. This breakdown process (intestinal uricolysis) is responsible for approximately one-third of total urate disposal, which comprises nearly all the urate disposed of by extrarenal routes. Under normal conditions, uric acid in the gut is almost completely degraded by colonic bacteria, with little being found in the stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary uric acid excretion normally accounts for the remaining two-thirds of the daily uric acid disposal. Distinct processes involved in uric acid excretion by the human kidney were originally operationally defined by means of pharmacologic and physiologic studies in experimental animals and in humans. The results of these studies were interpreted as consistent with a &quot;four-compartment&quot; model for renal urate handling comprised of glomerular filtration; presecretory reabsorption; secretion; and postsecretory reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], with the last three steps occurring in the proximal tubule. Subsequent studies confirmed that urate circulates with only a small proportion (less than 5 percent) bound to serum proteins.</p><p>Thus, all or nearly all urate is readily available for filtration at the glomerulus. However, renal clearance of uric acid in normal adults is only 7 to 12 percent of the filtered load, indicating that, under usual circumstances, there is net tubular reabsorption of about 90 percent of filtered urate. Understanding of the dynamics of urate handling between glomerular filtration and urinary excretion is now recognized as involving multiple tubular reabsorptive and secretory processes mediated by urate transporters that may be colinear as well as sequential in their actions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2250606303\"><span class=\"h1\">REGULATION OF SERUM URATE LEVELS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A matter of particular interest is how two net reabsorptive transporters, URAT1 and GLUT9, members of the organic acid transporter (OAT) family, and ABCG2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>], a secretory transporter, expressed in the gut as well as the kidney, affect regulation of serum urate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/3,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,13</a>].</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">urate/organic</span> anion exchanger (URAT1) was the first urate transporter identified and characterized in detail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. URAT1 is a highly urate-specific and distinct organic anion exchanger and is encoded by <em>SLC22A12</em>, a gene residing on chromosome 11q13. The URAT1 protein is localized to the luminal membrane of proximal renal tubular epithelial cells but is not present on distal tubular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] or confirmed to be elsewhere in the body in humans. Urate transport via URAT1 is independent of direct sodium-urate cotransport and is not driven by membrane potential.</p><p>URAT1-mediated transport is, however, inhibited selectively by organic anions, including metabolites: lactate, nicotinate, acetoacetate, hydroxybutyrate, and succinate. Intracellular accumulation of organic anions, for which URAT1 has affinity, favors the reabsorption of urate in exchange for these anions, which move down their electrochemical gradients into the tubular lumen. This scheme provides a basis for the hyperuricemia associated with increased levels of these anions.</p><p>Certain drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a>, phenylbutazone, sulfinpyrazone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a>, benzbromarone, and diuretics, also affect urate transport.</p><p>Drugs or metabolites with affinity for URAT1 will be uricosuric when acting from the tubular lumen but will be urico-retentive when acting from the intracellular space, providing a basis for URAT1-mediated regulation of blood urate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Mutations in <em>SLC22A12</em> have been demonstrated in affected members of families with inherited renal tubular defects resulting in hypouricemia, increased excretion of urate, susceptibility to exercise-induced acute renal failure, and chronic renal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypouricemia-causes-and-clinical-significance#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypouricemia: Causes and clinical significance&quot;, section on 'Familial renal hypouricemia'</a>.)</p><p>Although the functional characteristics of URAT1 appear to explain much of the dynamics of renal tubular uric acid handling and many of the effects of drugs and metabolites on uric acid transport in the kidney, knowledge of these processes remained incomplete. URAT1 did not uniquely explain renal urate transport in either normal individuals or primary gout patients.</p><p>First, studies of the structure and function of URAT1 in patients with primary gout did not confirm that a major proportion of primary gout with uric acid underexcretion results from increased expression of URAT1, either as a result of structural alterations in the transporter or its gene (as with genetic polymorphisms) or from increased numbers of transporter molecules due to altered function of an effector(s) of URAT1 turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In fact, gout and hyperuricemia were associated with a number of renal urate transporter genes in addition to <em>SLC22A12</em>. These include <em>SLC2A9</em> (the gene encoding GLUT9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/3,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,18</a>], <em>ABCG2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/8,11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,18</a>], <em>SLC17A1</em> (the gene encoding a sodium-phosphate cotransporter, NPT1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], <em>SLC17A3</em> (the gene encoding another sodium-phosphate cotransporter, NPT4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], <em>SLC22A11</em> (the gene encoding an organic acid transporter, OAT4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and <em>SLC16A9</em> (the gene encoding monocarboxylic acid transporter 9, MCT9). In addition, genetic associations between serum urate levels and the <em>PDZK1</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>] further support the importance of a URAT1-PDZ-NPT1 complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] in the control of net urate <span class=\"nowrap\">reabsorption/secretion</span>.</p><p>Second, the finding that the fractional renal excretion of urate (FEur = uric acid <span class=\"nowrap\">clearance/creatinine</span> clearance x 100) in <em>URAT1</em> knockout mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] remains substantially less than 1.0 suggests that mechanisms of uric acid reabsorption other than URAT1 contribute to this process.</p><p>In support of this view, a large, well-powered human genome-wide scan revealed associations of three genes encoding renal urate transporters other than <em>SLC22A12</em> (<em>SLC2A9</em>, <em>ABCG2</em>, and <em>SLC17A3</em>) with serum urate concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Of these urate transporter genes, <em>SLC2A9</em> has the strongest effect on serum urate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The product of the <em>SLC2A9</em> gene on chromosome 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>] is glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9), a voltage-driven urate efflux transporter that mediates urate reabsorption from the tubular cell to the circulation. In man, GLUT9 exists in two isoforms: GLUT9a, identified on the basolateral aspect of the proximal renal tubular epithelial cell, and GLUT9b on the apical surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/13,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23,24</a>]. As with URAT1, the reabsorption of urate by GLUT9 is inhibited by the uricosuric agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a> and benzbromarone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>GLUT9, when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, has strong uric acid transporting ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and had previously been identified as a fructose transporter. It is possible that this finding may contribute to an understanding of the associations of hyperuricemia, gout, and components of the metabolic syndrome with diets rich in high fructose-containing corn syrup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].</p><p>A substantial role for <em>SLC2A9</em> in the physiologic regulation of serum or plasma urate levels is further suggested by the results of genome-wide association and genotyping studies confirming that the <em>SLC2A9</em> locus and certain polymorphisms in <em>SLC2A9</em> are associated with an increased risk for hyperuricemia and gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/3,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,18</a>]. Mutations of GLUT9 have also been linked with renal hypouricemia, in patients with intact URAT1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Two genes, <em>ABCG2</em> and <em>SLC17A</em>1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/7,11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,18</a>], which have been identified by genome-wide association studies as associated with gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>], also encode renal proximal tubular epithelium luminal surface urate transporters involved in urate efflux (luminal secretion). The mechanisms by which common variants of these genes are associated with serum urate elevations, however, appear to differ. A mutation affecting the <em>SLC17A1</em> gene product (NPT1) is associated with increased risk of hyperuricemia and substantially reduces apical vesicle urate transport compared with that of wild-type NPT1. This reduction is presumed to lead to a dominance of reabsorption across the proximal tubule, leading to hyperuricemia.</p><p>By contrast, hyperuricemic patients with graded levels of ABCG2 dysfunction, grouped on the basis of genotype for dysfunctional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have what superficially appears to be hyperuricemia due to uric acid overproduction on the basis of elevated urinary urate excretion and fractional uric acid excretion of &gt;5.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Intestinal urate excretion is reduced by more than 50 percent in <em>ABCG2</em> knockout mice. Hence, by extension, what would appear to be overproduction hyperuricemia in humans with ABCG2 dysfunction is more accurately characterized as renal overload hyperuricemia due to reduced intestinal secretion of urate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. ABCG2 dysfunction also appears to cause renal underexcretion of urate in patients with lesser degrees of functional impairment, classified again on the basis of genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Of additional interest, the product of the <em>SLC17A4</em> gene has been identified on the luminal membrane of the human small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Heterologous expression of this gene product indicates that it possesses transporter characteristics, indicating it may also play a role in intestinal urate secretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H291958327\"><span class=\"h2\">Urate metabolism in pathophysiologic circumstances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept that uric acid is an inert biochemical end product with clinical consequences arising only when saturating concentrations result in symptomatic urate or uric acid crystal deposition (gout, urolithiasis, acute uric acid nephropathy) has been increasingly challenged over several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Several hypotheses have been presented to explain why the evolution of hominids has favored higher urate levels in humans and other primate species, and emphasis has been directed to the considerable evidence that gout and otherwise &quot;asymptomatic&quot; hyperuricemia are apparent risk factors for major metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/25,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33,34</a>].</p><p>Although causal roles for hyperuricemia or gout in these diseases have yet to be established, considerable evidence has been published supporting the view that urate formation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metabolism play roles in the activation of inflammatory and other pathogenetic mechanisms suspected to contribute to the development or progression of these comorbid disorders. These mechanisms include activation of the renin-angiotensin pathway, restriction of nitric oxide availability, promotion of oxidative stress, and dysfunction of intra-hepatic fructose metabolism.</p><p>In this regard, two aspects of urate metabolism have been identified as contributors, to oxidative stress and, ultimately, inflammation. First, uric acid is a substrate for myeloperoxidase (MPO), an oxidative enzyme expressed in activated neutrophils and monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], which in the presence of hydrogen peroxide catalyzes formation of the reactive O<sub>2</sub> species (5-hydroxyurate, hydroperoxide, and the urate radical) that in turn accelerate oxidation of reduced glutathione. The result is generation of a proinflammatory state impairing the function of antiinflammatory molecules (eg, high-density lipoprotein, HDL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and, potentially, endothelial cells. Second, uric acid formation generates superoxide, which can combine with nitric oxide to form the long-acting pro-oxidative peroxynitrite radical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Thus, in pathophysiologic states, metabolism of urate is enhanced, although it seems likely that the functional effects of the products of the respective reactions are of more clinical importance than their effects on uric acid balance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERURICEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased efficiency of renal uric acid excretion is responsible for about 85 to 90 percent of primary or secondary hyperuricemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This observation is not surprising based on the complexity of renal uric acid handling and the sensitivity of the kidney to endogenous metabolites, alterations in volume status, and drugs. Volume depletion due to diuretics, for example, is a common cause of hyperuricemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diuretic-induced-hyperuricemia-and-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diuretic-induced hyperuricemia and gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to appreciate, however, that &quot;underexcretors&quot; actually have normal rates of urinary uric acid excretion since this is required to maintain the steady state in which urate production and disposal are relatively equal (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H838162389\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'The steady state'</a>). It is the reduced efficiency of urate excretion that obligates a higher serum urate concentration in order to achieve the necessary rate of urinary uric acid excretion.</p><p>The remaining 10 to 15 percent of patients with hyperuricemia ostensibly overproduce uric acid. These disorders are often due to inherited defects in regulation of purine nucleotide synthesis, disordered adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolism, or disorders resulting in increased rates of cell turnover. However, even among those whose daily excretion of uric acid is higher than normal, decreased efficiency of renal uric acid excretion may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Several studies provide a likely mechanistic basis for this latter finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In some gout patients with a <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperuricemia/gout</span> risk allele (polymorphism) for the high-capacity urate transporter ABCG2, daily excretion of uric acid in the urine was paradoxically well within the normal range and often in a range (&gt;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> implying uric acid overproduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Since the gene product, Abcg2, is expressed in the gut as well as the renal proximal tubule, this paradox apparently results from the genetically determined underexcretion of uric acid in the gut, with consequent compensatory (but still relatively reduced) uric acid clearance at the kidney. This view was supported by the finding that patients with two risk alleles showed higher serum urate and urinary uric acid levels, implying that reduction of intestinal urate excretion directly correlated with increases in uric acid blood and urine burdens. Excessive daily urinary uric acid excretion thus does not unequivocally imply uric acid overproduction. Rather, overexcretion of urinary uric acid may result from either &quot;extra-renal urate underexcretion&quot; or from genuine urate overproduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asymptomatic-hyperuricemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asymptomatic hyperuricemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOURICEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar pathogenetic considerations apply to hypouricemia. This biochemical aberration can be induced by decreased production (primarily due to rare enzyme defects) or to increased urinary excretion. The latter can result from a genetic defect in the urate-organic anion countertransporter URAT1 in the proximal tubule (encoded by the <em>SLC22A12</em> gene) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>], a loss of function genetic defect in the high-capacity renal urate transporter GLUT9 (encoded by SLC2A9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urate-balance/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], the Fanconi syndrome, with volume expansion in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, in some malignancies (especially Hodgkin lymphoma), and in the syndrome of cerebral salt wasting.

The entry of urate into the intestine is mediated at least in part by the high-capacity urate efflux transporter, ABCG2, the product of the <em>ABCG2</em> gene, which is also expressed in proximal renal tubular epithelium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intestinal tract bacteria degrade uric acid. This process (intestinal uricolysis) is responsible for approximately one-third of total urate disposal. Urinary uric acid excretion accounts for the remaining two-thirds of the daily uric acid disposal. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Uric acid disposal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Molecular genetic and physiologic studies of urate transport have identified multiple renal urate transporters operating in the proximal renal tubule and have established polymorphisms in the genes encoding several of these transporters, as well as effects of pharmacologic agents that underlie disordered uric acid balance. The major reabsorptive transporters of urate in the renal tubule are URAT1 (product of the <em>SLC22A12</em> gene) and GLUT9 (SLC2A9). Polymorphisms of several renal urate transporters impart an increased risk for hyperuricemia and gout. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Uric acid disposal'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal tract'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Urinary excretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased efficiency of renal uric acid excretion is responsible for about 85 to 90 percent of primary or secondary hyperuricemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799 \">table 1</a>). This results from a reduced efficiency of urate excretion that obligates a higher serum urate concentration in order to achieve the necessary rate of urinary uric acid excretion. &quot;Underexcretors&quot; actually have normal rates of urinary uric acid excretion since this is required to maintain the steady state in which urate production and disposal are relatively equal. The remaining 10 to 15 percent of patients with hyperuricemia overexcrete uric acid in the daily urine: in some instances, this reflects inherited defects in regulation of purine nucleotide synthesis, disordered adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolism, or disorders resulting in increased rates of cell turnover. In other instances, overexcretion of urinary urate results from extra-renal urate underexcretion due to genetically determined defects in <em>ABCG2 </em>urate efflux into the gut. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hyperuricemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypouricemia can be induced by decreased production (primarily due to rare enzyme defects) or to increased urinary excretion of uric acid.
