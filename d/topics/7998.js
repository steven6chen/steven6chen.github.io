Two of the most common types of headaches in children are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tension-type headaches</strong> &ndash; Tension-type headaches cause pressure or tightness on both the left and right sides of the head. Tension headaches are usually not severe enough to keep children from doing their daily activities, such as going to school.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Migraine headaches</strong> &ndash; Migraine headaches often start off mild and then get worse. They might affect just one side of the head or both. They can cause your child to feel sick or vomit or make your child sensitive to light and sound. They can also cause temporary problems with vision. For example, before getting a migraine, some children see spots or colored lights. When they have a migraine, children are often not able to do their normal daily activities, such as go to school.</p><p/><p>Children also tend to get headaches that go along with a cold, the flu, a sore throat, or a sinus infection</p><p>In rare cases headaches in children are caused by a serious infection (such as meningitis), severe high blood pressure, or brain tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868644\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or a nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should take your child to the doctor right away (without giving any medicine) if he or she has a headache that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts after a head injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wakes him or her up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is sudden and severe and happens with other symptoms, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neck pain or stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Double vision or changes in vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss of balance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever of 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher</p><p/><p>You should also take your child to see a doctor or nurse if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets headaches more than once a month</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a headache and is younger than 3 years old</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a headache and has certain medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease, bleeding problems, immune system problems, genetic problems, heart problems, or cancer</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868661\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to help my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your child's headache does not fit the descriptions above, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child rest in a quiet dark room with a cool cloth on his or her forehead</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encourage your child to sleep, if he or she wants to. Sleep can help, especially with migraine headaches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give your child pain medicine, such as children's <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or children's <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin). Never give your child <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>. In children, aspirin can cause a life-threatening condition called Reye syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868678\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests my child should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Most headaches in children are not caused by a serious problem.</p><p>Your child's doctor or nurse will probably be able to tell what is wrong with your child by doing an exam and by learning about his or her symptoms. But if your child's doctor or nurse suspects a serious infection or problem, he or she might order an imaging test such as an MRI or a CT scan. Imaging tests create images of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868693\"><span class=\"h1\">How are headaches in children treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many types of medicines used to treat and to prevent headaches. Your child's doctor or nurse will talk with you about which medicine, if any, would work best for your child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868710\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to keep my child from getting headaches?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some headaches can be triggered by certain foods or things that children do. Keep a &quot;headache diary&quot; for your child. In the diary, write down every time your child has a headache and what he or she ate and did before it started. That way, you can find out if there is anything he or she should avoid.</p><p>Some common headache triggers are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skipping meals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not drinking enough fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having too little or too much caffeine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeping too much or too little</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain foods, such as bologna or hot dogs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15868727\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Head injury in children and adolescents (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-causes-and-diagnosis-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache causes and diagnosis in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Migraine headaches in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a> </p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
