The diagnosis of hypertension is made in this setting only after an elevated and properly measured blood pressure has been confirmed on multiple occasions or, preferably, if an elevated blood pressure obtained in the office is confirmed by out-of-office measurements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F105050\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105050 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hypertensive-adult/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Simply asking the patient &quot;How long have you had high blood pressure?&quot; may lead to a misleading answer. Suppose, as an example, that the patient says two years.

Thus, the patient may have had undiagnosed hypertension for many years.</p><p>Another important consideration, particularly in the patient with very high blood pressures <span class=\"nowrap\">(&ge;180/&ge;120</span> mmHg), is the history of prior treatment for hypertension and nonadherence to antihypertensive medications since this is a common finding in patients with severe hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper technique for measurement of blood pressure is detailed elsewhere.
