However, without additional cytotoxic therapy, virtually all of these patients will relapse within a few weeks or months. In contrast, patients who receive post-remission therapy may expect five-year survival rates up to 60 percent in adults with standard risk disease.</p><p>Induction therapy aims to reduce the total body leukemia cell population from approximately 10<sup>12</sup> to below the cytologically detectable level of about 10<sup>9</sup> cells. It is generally assumed, however, that a substantial burden of leukemia cells persists undetected in patients in initial clinical and morphologic CR (ie, &quot;minimal residual disease&quot;), leading to relapse within a few weeks or months if no further therapy were administered.</p><p>The primary aim of post-remission therapy (eg, consolidation, intensification) is to eradicate this minimal residual disease. There are three basic options for post-remission therapy (in order of increasing intensity): consolidation plus maintenance chemotherapy, autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), or allogeneic HCT. The choice among these for an individual patient depends upon a number of factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expected rate of relapse with consolidation chemotherapy alone (influenced strongly by the patient and tumor characteristics)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expected morbidity and mortality associated with treatment options (as determined by patient characteristics such as age and comorbidities)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salvage (or rescue) therapies available for the treatment of relapsed disease</p><p/><p>In general, a risk-adapted treatment approach is used that offers more intensive therapy to patients with a higher risk of relapse.

Patients should be evaluated at the time of first complete remission (CR1) to determine their expected risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H771935297\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying high risk disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, patients are categorized as having standard or high risk disease based upon a combination of clinical features and tumor characteristics. There is increasing evidence regarding the prognostic importance of end of induction minimal residual disease (MRD, also called measurable residual disease) level. While MRD measurement is not available at all centers, it can be incorporated into this assessment when available. &#160;</p><p>While many variations in risk stratification have been proposed, we use the following risk stratification system (ie, a modification of the Hoelzer risk criteria).</p><p>Patients with any of the following characteristics are considered to have high risk disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High white blood cell count at diagnosis (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;30,000/microL</span> in B-ALL or <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL</span> in T-ALL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities &ndash; t(4;11), t(1;19), t(9;22), or BCR-ABL gene positivity.

This risk stratification system was developed based upon analyses of prognostic factors in patients enrolled on prospective trials and many of these characteristics have been used in other prospective trials that have tested a risk-adapted approach to consolidation therapy. </p><p>While MRD after induction can define a group of patients with ALL at high risk for relapse, the following caveats must be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of MRD is predictive of shorter disease-free survival using conventional treatment regimens. Its importance is likely therapy-dependent and may change as better therapies are developed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no randomized trials evaluating the efficacy of altering treatment based on MRD after induction in adults with ALL.

Thus, this laboratory measurement does not discriminate perfectly.</p><p/><p>The effect of these clinical features on relapse risk is described below. The effect of cytogenetic abnormalities on relapse risk is described separately.

The high-risk subset varies somewhat from study to study and is in part treatment-dependent. However, older age and the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome have been universally identified as markers of poor prognosis.

As an example, a controlled trial of 2090 children with ALL randomly assigned to receive either standard or intensified therapy reported that the blast percentage on day eight of therapy was a significant predictor of prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients with 25 percent or fewer bone marrow blasts on day eight had higher rates of progression-free survival at three years (eg, 74 versus 62 percent, respectively).</p><p>Although not available at all centers, a post-remission minimal residual disease (MRD, also called measurable residual disease) level &ge;10<sup>-4 </sup>or &ge;10<sup>-3 </sup>is an independent marker of high risk disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. The prognostic value of MRD in this setting is discussed in detail separately.

This is largely due to two factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unfavorable genetic features are more common in older adults (more Ph+ cases; fewer cases of T cell ALL) &ndash; The impact of these unfavorable genetic features is likely to change as the prognosis for Ph+ ALL has improved with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in combination with less intensive chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-remission therapy for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients do not tolerate very well the intensive and prolonged chemotherapy used in younger adults &ndash; Mainstays of ALL treatment, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, asparaginase, and corticosteroids, are not well tolerated by older adults, and doses are often reduced or eliminated. Older patients also cannot tolerate myeloablative conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Less intensive conditioning regimens, better donor matching and availability of unrelated donors, and better immunosuppressive agents and supportive care strategies have made transplant more feasible in this population.</p><p/><p>As such, it is important to remember that &quot;risk factors&quot; are always relative to available treatments, and fortunately these are improving, both for chemoimmunotherapy for ALL and for allogeneic transplantation. Chronological age alone is probably not a high risk factor but only a surrogate for inability to tolerate curative treatment for subtypes of ALL that are biologically relatively resistant to conventional chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSOLIDATION AND INTENSIFICATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63940798\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, the three main options for consolidation therapy (in order of increasing intensity) are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consolidation chemotherapy &ndash; Nonmyeloablative chemotherapy has a low treatment-related mortality rate (less than 5 percent). Common major side effects are generally short-term and include pancytopenia, infection, hepatic impairment, and neuropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) &ndash; Autologous HCT allows the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and is not associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but does not provide the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect seen with allogeneic HCT. Treatment-related morbidity and mortality are relatively low (&le;6 percent). Prospective randomized trials have reported that event-free and overall survival rates with autologous HCT are either similar or inferior to those obtained with consolidation chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allogeneic HCT &ndash; Allogeneic HCT targets cancer cells both by administering intensive and sometimes myeloablative chemotherapy and by harnessing a GVL effect. Treatment-related mortality is high on average (approximately 20 percent), but varies in individuals according to patient-related transplantation risk factors (eg, age, comorbid conditions). In addition, allogeneic HCT can result in significant morbidity associated with GVHD, chronic cytopenias, second malignancies, cataracts, and sterility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quality of life following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>There is great variability in practice and it remains controversial how intensive post-remission therapy should be, but most clinicians use a risk-adapted treatment approach where patients with disease at high risk for relapse are treated with more aggressive therapy (eg, allogeneic HCT) than patients at standard risk for relapse. This approach minimizes exposure to potentially toxic therapies in patients expected to respond well to conventional chemotherapy while providing maximum antitumor activity for patients with more difficult-to-treat disease.</p><p>The following sections describe our approach to the treatment of standard and high risk disease. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL require specialized therapy and this is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard risk disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no clear consensus regarding the optimal consolidation therapy for patients with standard risk ALL. Consolidation chemotherapy produces four-year survival rates of 40 to 60 percent. Common major side effects include pancytopenia, infection, liver toxicity, and neuropathy. The majority of deaths are due to relapsed disease and long-term complications from therapy are rare. Alternatively, allogeneic HCT results in a lower relapse rate, but higher rates of treatment-related mortality and morbidity resulting in similar rates of long-term survival. In contrast, autologous HCT does not appear to improve on the results seen with consolidation chemotherapy or allogeneic HCT in this population.</p><p>There have been no randomized trials directly comparing consolidation chemotherapy with allogeneic HCT. Other analyses have had mixed results with some suggesting that allogeneic HCT may result in higher long-term overall survival and others reporting that it does not. Given this uncertainty, all patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. We offer the following guidance for the treatment of patients who are either not candidates for clinical trials or choose not to participate.</p><p>For most patients with standard risk ALL in CR1, we suggest the use of consolidation chemotherapy rather than either allogeneic or autologous HCT. This preference places a relatively high value on avoiding the higher short-term mortality and long-term morbidity associated with HCT and a low value on the potential, but uncertain, ability of the more intensive transplant therapy to eliminate residual disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consolidation chemotherapy for ALL consists of a variety of chemotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action administered in combinations over several courses at short intervals that span a total of approximately seven months. The individual drugs used vary by protocol, but typically include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, 6-mercaptopurine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67471 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81231\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81231 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54375\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54375 \">table 3</a>). Central nervous system prophylaxis with either intrathecal chemotherapy or radiation therapy is incorporated as well. The goal is to deliver high doses of these agents without causing severe cytopenias that lead to treatment delays.</p><p>These regimens have evolved empirically with few of the individual components tested rigorously in randomized trials. Thus, it is difficult to analyze critically the absolute contribution of each drug or dose schedule to the ultimate outcome. Numerous nonrandomized trials have attempted to answer these questions, but multiple alterations in study design between sequential trials have made it difficult to assess the exact merit of each modification.</p><p>Several nonrandomized studies strongly suggest a benefit from intensive multiagent postremission chemotherapy. In contrast, prospective studies evaluating even more intensive chemotherapy regimens have not demonstrated improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/5,6,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,18-22</a>].

As such, there is no single best regimen for post-remission therapy. In general, the consolidation chemotherapy regimen should be consistent with the induction regimen that was chosen at the time of diagnosis.

Instead, investigators have relied on a &quot;genetic randomization&quot; in which patients are assigned to treatment with or without allogeneic HCT based upon the presence or absence of an HLA-matched sibling donor. Patients without an HLA-matched sibling are assigned to treatment with either chemotherapy alone or autologous HCT, depending upon the trial design. Results are then evaluated by an intention-to-treat analysis for &quot;donor&quot; and &quot;no donor&quot; (available) treatment groups. As with randomized trials, not all patients in the &quot;donor&quot; group ultimately receive an allogeneic HCT, but they would still be included in the &quot;donor&quot; group for the statistical analysis.</p><p>There is clearly more treatment-related mortality as well as later morbidity after allogeneic HCT than after chemotherapy alone. However, the relapse rate is reduced by allogeneic transplantation. Younger age (&lt;35 years), better transplantation methods, and availability of an optimal donor may favor allogeneic HCT in CR1. This is discussed in more detail separately.

It is associated with fewer treatment-related complications, largely due to the lack of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In addition, developments in technology and supportive care have made autologous HCT available for larger numbers of patients, including older adults. However, autologous HCT does not have a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, which is a key component of the transplantation process. As described above, prospective randomized trials have reported that event-free and overall survival rates with auto-HCT are either similar or inferior to those obtained with consolidation chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/27-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-34</a>] (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy versus allogeneic transplant'</a> above.)</p><p>As an example, in the French LALA-87 trial described above, patients 15 to 40 years of age who lacked an HLA-identical sibling, and those 40 to 50 years of age and still in CR1 after two courses of consolidation chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to auto-HCT or to maintenance chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. There were no differences in overall survival (34 versus 29 percent in the chemotherapy arm) or in survival in either the high-risk (16 versus 11 percent) or standard risk (49 versus 40 percent) subgroups.</p><p>The main cause for failure after auto-HCT for ALL is a high relapse rate. The factors implicated in this process include the inefficiency of the conditioning regimen in eradicating leukemia, the lack of <span class=\"nowrap\">GVHD/GVL,</span> and contamination of the stem cell graft by leukemic cells. Data indicate that the autograft can be the source of recurrent ALL cells in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, it is equally likely that many relapses arise from residual disease in the subject, not from graft contamination. This may be the main reason why purging bone marrow in vitro has no detectable impact on relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Maintenance chemotherapy has not commonly been used after auto-HCT, although one study reported a probability of survival of 53 percent at 10 years when auto-HCT was followed by two years of maintenance chemotherapy for adults in CR1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. On the other hand, a randomized trial evaluating interleukin (IL)-2 after auto-HCT showed no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive care is a critical component to the treatment of patients with acute leukemia. This includes the management of cytopenias, infections, tumor lysis, and other complications that accompany the treatment of acute leukemia. These are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia in younger adults&quot;, section on 'Supportive care'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">High risk disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with high risk disease, as defined above, do poorly when treated with consolidation chemotherapy alone after attainment of a complete remission (CR1); rates of 10-year overall survival with this approach are approximately 10 percent. In contrast, treatment with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) provides an additional graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect together with myeloablative chemotherapy, resulting in superior survival rates of approximately 45 percent at 10 years.</p><p>For young patients with high-risk ALL in CR1 who have an HLA-matched donor, we recommend allogeneic HCT rather than consolidation chemotherapy or autologous HCT. Unfortunately, many patients achieving a CR are excluded from HCT due to early relapse, comorbid medical conditions, lack of insurance, or lack of a suitable HLA-matched donor. For patients with high-risk ALL in CR1 who are not candidates for allogeneic HCT, we suggest consolidation chemotherapy rather than autologous HCT. Alternatively, these patients may be considered for reduced-intensity allogeneic HCT as part of a clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>For some older adults with high-risk ALL in CR1, allogeneic transplantation, when compared with standard chemotherapy, offers the advantage of an intensive therapy administered over a shorter period of time with a more rapid recovery of blood counts from the donor's normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. This compares with two to three years of continuous immunosuppression required for standard chemotherapy to have a good chance of curing their leukemia. Thus, some older patients may benefit from an allogeneic transplant in CR1 when they are otherwise healthy and well nourished with minimal residual disease, rather than attempt a transplant later after a relapse when they are sicker and may have more refractory disease present. Nevertheless, transplantation has morbidities that are not present with chemotherapy, such as graft&ndash;versus-host disease, which, if it occurs, can be quite difficult for older patients to survive. Less intensive conditioning regimens, better donor matching and availability of unrelated donors, and better immunosuppressive agents and supportive care strategies have extended the transplant eligibility age up to about 70 years.</p><p>Patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL require specialized therapy; this is discussed in more detail separately.

Instead, investigators have relied on a &quot;genetic randomization&quot; in which patients are assigned to treatment with or without allogeneic HCT based upon the presence or absence of an HLA-matched sibling donor. Patients without an HLA-matched sibling are assigned to treatment with either chemotherapy alone or autologous HCT, depending upon the trial design. Results are then evaluated by an intention-to-treat analysis for &quot;donor&quot; and &quot;no donor&quot; (available) treatment groups. As with randomized trials, not all patients in the &quot;donor&quot; group ultimately receive an allogeneic HCT, but they would still be included in the &quot;donor&quot; group for the statistical analysis.

Patients aged 15 to 40 years underwent HLA-typing and 116 had an HLA-identical sibling, 98 of whom underwent a matched sibling HCT. Those without an HLA-identical sibling and patients 40 to 50 years old were randomly assigned treatment with either auto HCT (95 patients) or chemotherapy (96 patients). All patients over 50 years were treated with chemotherapy alone (58 patients).

(See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'High risk disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are still in CR1 after completing consolidation chemotherapy, we recommend two to three years of maintenance chemotherapy rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The most commonly used regimen is daily 6-mercaptopurine given in the evening, weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and monthly pulses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (ie, POMP) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> administered for three years.
