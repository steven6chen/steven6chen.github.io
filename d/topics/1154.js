Additional advice can be obtained from the Division of Immunization at the CDC (1-404-639-8225).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF IMMUNIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors are important when administering vaccines to healthy adults. These issues include the type of immunization to be used, safety, the responsibilities of the individual giving the vaccination, and proper storage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most vaccinations induce active immunity by promoting the development of antibody in the recipient, a response which is expected to be durable. Passive immunization, which usually involves the administration of a globulin product, produces transient immunity for a specific exposure through the transfer of antibody directly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Active</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of active immunization of a vaccine or toxoid is to stimulate the host to produce a primary immune response (usually by inducing B-cell proliferation, antibody response, and T-cell sensitization). If an individual is subsequently exposed to the pathogen against which the vaccine is directed, the exposure results in a secondary response that includes increased proliferation of B cells and formation of antibodies. The secondary response protects the individual from developing disease, ideally for life.</p><p>Some vaccines require boosters to sustain protection. Vaccines used for active immunization are derived from whole killed bacteria, live attenuated bacteria or viruses, or antigenic subunits of organisms. Vaccines recommended for healthy adults are the pneumococcal, influenza, hepatitis B, MMR, varicella, and hepatitis A vaccines.</p><p>Toxoids used for active immunization are bacterial toxins that are modified to render them nontoxic. Toxoids induce the formation of antitoxin antibody. If the host is exposed to the bacterial toxin after immunization, the antitoxin antibody binds to the bacterial toxin, thereby preventing toxin-mediated disease. Toxoids recommended for healthy adults are tetanus and diphtheria toxoid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Passive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Passive immunization involves administration of antibodies (as intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> derived from pooled human serum or antitoxin derived from serum harvested from immunized animals). Passive immunization offers short-term protection to people who have been or will be exposed to a specific pathogen and is typically used by immunocompromised patients who are unable to produce an effective immune response with active immunization. Passive immunization is not routinely recommended for healthy adults because the majority of adults are capable of producing a durable immune response through active immunization. Passive immunization is occasionally used for healthcare workers, pregnant women, and international travelers (See appropriate topic reviews).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommended method of storage, preparation, and route of administration of each vaccine is described in the package insert; these instructions must be followed precisely (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81508\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81508 \">table 1</a>). Recommendations regarding practical issues, such as vaccination spacing and timing, injection techniques, and storage and handling, are also available in the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines, which are available at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncird/&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsQX1UTuOik55WL0aueUfYbISYwbVj062mu0pnQwgzkAi&amp;TOPIC_ID=3884\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Most adult vaccines are administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, usually in or over the deltoid muscle. Deltoid intramuscular injections should be given with a 1 to 1.5 inch needle to achieve at least 5 mm of muscle penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The buttock should be avoided for routine vaccine administration, except for large volume injections of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, because immunogenicity of the hepatitis B vaccine, at least, is significantly lower when given in the buttock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Subcutaneous injection should be given with a 23 to 25 gauge needle with a needle length of <span class=\"nowrap\">5/8</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4</span> inch. Use of doses other than those specified in the package insert is not recommended.</p><p>While every effort should be made to adhere to the recommended immunization schedule, it is not necessary to restart the series of any vaccine, even when the interval between doses is prolonged. Subsequent immunizations should continue on the originally recommended immunization schedule.</p><p>Most widely used vaccines can be administered simultaneously at different sites without compromising efficacy. For adults of all ages, coadministration of the pneumococcal and influenza vaccine appears safe and does not compromise efficacy of either vaccine. In a Finnish study of 9336 individuals ages 65 years and older, the group of 4755 who received simultaneous pneumococcal and influenza vaccines experienced approximately double the number of mild local reactions and fevers compared to the 4581 receiving influenza vaccine alone (441 per 1000 vaccinations versus 284 per 1000 for local reactions and 10 per 1000 versus 24 per 1000 for fever) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Providers are expected to use vaccine information statements available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local or state health departments for MMR, polio, and pertussis vaccines as well as tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (pertussis vaccine is recommended for children, not adults).</p><p>It is also vital to maintain permanent immunization records that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of vaccine and dose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The site and route of administration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The date that the vaccine was administered</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The date that the next dose is due</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The manufacturer and lot number</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The name, address, and title of the person administering the vaccine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most vaccines are safe to administer, causing only minor side effects. The more common problem with immunization is the missed opportunity to vaccinate based in part upon public misconceptions about the safety of immunization. Many vaccines and toxoids cause side effects such as fever, local reactions at the site of injection, or even serum sickness-like reactions. These adverse reactions can be caused by the immunogenic moiety in the vaccine or by trace amounts of antibiotics, preservatives, stabilizers, and residual animal proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These side effects are not considered true contraindications to vaccination.</p><p>True contraindications to vaccination are rare and include severe hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis and severe neurologic complications. Administration of live virus vaccines to immunocompromised patients is also contraindicated. Vaccination should be avoided only if true contraindications are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75067 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].

The national goals of Healthy People 2020 focus on increasing immunization rates and reducing preventable infectious diseases in adults as well as children. Specific goals directed at adults include increasing coverage of 17 vaccines administered across the life span [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Administration of the vaccines included in this topic review is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Medicare Part B reimburses for both the influenza and pneumococcal vaccine. Despite the institutional support for immunization, vaccine delivery to adults is poor. Barriers to immunization of adults include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Missed opportunities during contacts with healthcare providers in offices, outpatient clinics, and hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of vaccine delivery systems in the public and private sectors that can reach adults in different settings (eg, the workplace)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient and provider fears about adverse events following vaccination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provider concerns about efficacy of individual vaccines</p><p/><p>There are limited data on the effectiveness of various strategies to improve adult immunization and many unanswered questions.

Health maintenance sheets can be placed at the front of all patient charts and can be used to generate standing orders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital-based strategies &ndash; Using a standing order (eg, on admission or discharge), rather than requiring a physician's signature, has been successfully used by certain institutions for high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. High-risk patients can be identified by physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and infection control practitioners or by computerized systems searching for high-risk diagnoses and patient age. By contrast, inclusion of a guideline to administer pneumococcal vaccine prior to discharge as part of a pneumonia clinical pathway in Connecticut did not result in increased vaccination rates among adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Community-based programs &ndash; Vaccine coverage improves when public health departments specifically promote and offer vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunization as a measure of quality of care &ndash; The Infectious Diseases Society of America issued an Executive Summary on Immunization Coverage in the US, which cited the need to promote immunization as an important indicator of healthcare quality in managed care and other organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>A meta-analysis of 41 studies on the use of reminders to patients found that immunization rates improved for those reminded in 80 percent of the studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].
