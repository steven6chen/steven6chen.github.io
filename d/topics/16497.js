The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation) restores circulation. The event is called SCD if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>SCA and SCD occur most commonly in patients with structural heart disease (including previously undiagnosed heart disease), particularly coronary artery disease. SCD in the apparently normal heart (at autopsy) is less common and is responsible for 10 to 15 percent of cases of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. SCA with an apparently normal heart is more common in younger arrest victims. The majority of SCD patients without apparent structural heart disease likely do not actually have &quot;normal&quot; hearts, but our diagnostic tools limit identification of structural or functional abnormalities. In the past, the etiology of many of these deaths was unknown and deemed &quot;idiopathic.&quot; However, more complete evaluation has identified the cause of death as a primary electrical disorder (ie, long QT, Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW], catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT], and Brugada syndrome) in many of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

The incidence of SCD is increased six- to ten-fold in the presence of clinically recognized heart disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52309 \">figure 1</a>); it also increases with age and is two to three times more common in men than women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59028\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59028 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Although the risk of SCD is higher in patients with structural heart disease, SCD events occur in individuals with apparently normal hearts. In a series of 121 SCD cases where data on left ventricular function was available, 48 percent had normal left ventricular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among these patients, one-half had no history of established coronary heart disease.</p><p>Autopsy studies of subjects with a presumed diagnosis of SCD have shown high variability in the numbers of subject without a demonstrable cardiac abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/1,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-10</a>]. A lower value of about 5 percent has been described in autopsy studies and among survivors of SCD when older patients are included, a population in which coronary heart disease (CHD) is more prevalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. In an autopsy series of 902 cases of SCD (mean age 38 years), 187 (21 percent) had no evidence of cardiac pathology that could cause SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a separate autopsy series of 967 cases of SCD referred to a tertiary cardiac pathologist between 1994 and 2010, 45 percent of cases had a normal cardiac postmortem examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Atherosclerotic CHD at autopsy is much more commonly found in SCD victims who are older than 35 years (incidence 13.7 per 100,000 person-years versus 0.7 per 100,000 person years without CHD), yet causality is not always clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The distribution of cardiac causes of SCD varies with age, the population studied, and geography. While coronary heart disease (CAD) is listed as the underlying cause of SCD on the majority of death certificates among the general population in the United States, younger patients, athletes, and those without known prior disease often have a different distribution of causes. The etiology of SCD is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

Ischemia is the cause in the majority of these patients, and thus prompt evaluation for cardiac ischemia is warranted. In those without cardiac ischemia, CPVT, an inherited channelopathy, may be the cause. Affected patients typically present with life-threatening VT or ventricular fibrillation occurring during emotional or physical stress, with syncope often being the first manifestation of the disease. Although sporadic cases occur, this is a largely familial disease. The majority of known cases are due to mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor, which is the cardiac sarcoplasmic calcium release channel. One report suggested that this disorder may account for at least one in seven cases of sudden unexplained death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Brugada syndrome is due to a functional abnormality in repolarization. There may be some overlap with an early subclinical manifestation of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). The Brugada syndrome occurs in families, with genetic transmission consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A, have been found in several families.

This disorder is closely related and indeed may be the same as Brugada syndrome since a majority of affected patients have the ECG manifestations of the Brugada syndrome and the same mutations in the sodium channel gene.

Affected patients have no underlying heart disease and there is no structural damage to the chest wall, thoracic cavity, or the heart. Early defibrillation of commotio victims is lifesaving, despite historical evidence that resuscitation may be more difficult in commotio cordis than in other forms of SCD. Commotio cordis is discussed in detail separately.

The frequency with which this occurs was assessed in a report of 290 patients with aborted SCD. The mechanism was an arrhythmia associated with the WPW syndrome in 2.1 percent; atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response was the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A similar incidence of preexcitation (3.6 percent) was noted in a report of 273 children and young adults with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In contrast to long QT syndrome, ion channel defects associated with SQTS lead to abnormal abbreviation of repolarization, predisposing affected individuals to a risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. SQTS is discussed in detail separately.

In 2008 a higher frequency of early repolarization was described in 206 survivors of cardiac arrest without apparent heart disease (31 to 5 percent of controls; p&lt;0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These survivors tended to have increased incidences of recurrent VF compared with those SCA survivors with normal hearts and no early repolarization. Subsequent studies have confirmed the higher incidence of early repolarization in SCA survivors with normal hearts. Early repolarization in the inferior and lateral leads is associated with an increased risk of SCA. However, large population studies continue to describe a 5 to 10 percent incidence of early repolarization, and when found in the absence of a SCA it is thought benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

However, the absolute increase in risk is quite small since primary SCD is rare in the general population. The increase in risk is incompletely understood. Some of these families have an inherited cardiac disease, as illustrated in a report in which 147 first-degree relatives of 32 patients with SCD underwent detailed cardiac assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Autopsies may demonstrate that there was an underlying heart disease such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), congenital heart disease coronary anomalies, coronary artery disease, or dilated cardiomyopathies. Subtle cases of these diseases may be missed, particularly with standard autopsies. As noted, inherited arrhythmia syndromes are common in individuals who experience SCD but whose autopsy reveals no evidence of structural heart disease. Diagnosing such a syndrome would have significant implications for surviving family members, particularly if a specific genetic defect could be identified.

Although interpretation may be limited by the large number of candidate genes, the number of known mutations in each of these genes and variable gene expression and penetrance, continued development and knowledge of the gene pool database will be important for the management of the surviving relatives.</p><p>As both genetic testing techniques and our understanding of these heritable disorders improve, genetic screening at specialized centers has yielded diagnoses in up to one-third of young SCD victims without structural heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/12,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,31-33</a>].</p><p>In the largest reported series of 302 cases of sudden death with negative autopsy and negative toxicologic evaluation (median age 24 years, 65 percent male), molecular autopsy was performed, with sequencing for a panel of 77 genes associated with primary electrical disorders and cardiomyopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 40 patients (13 percent), most commonly variants associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and congenital long QT syndrome (17 and 11 patients, respectively). When results from the molecular autopsy were combined with clinical evaluation in the screening of surviving family members, the likelihood of making a significant clinical diagnosis increased from 26 to 39 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF SURVIVORS OF SCD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in patients with apparently normal hearts involves a variety of tests, including genetic analysis. These tests are performed in an effort to exclude underlying structural heart disease, primary electrical diseases, and drug or toxin exposure which may have contributed to SCA. In addition, a rigorous search for the known causes of SCA should be performed in the apparently healthy person prior to making the diagnosis of idiopathic VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An extensive discussion of the evaluation of SCA survivors is presented separately.

In families of victims of unexplained SCD, a general cardiology evaluation of first- and second-degree relatives can yield diagnosis of a heritable disease in up to 40 percent of families. A discussion of the evaluation of family members of victims of unexplained SCD is presented separately.

SCD is the most common cause of cardiovascular death in the developed world. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the risk of SCD is higher in patients with structural heart disease, as many as 10 to 15 percent of SCDs occur in individuals with apparently normal hearts.

In young patients, if there is no clear diagnosis after autopsy, genetic testing now can yield a diagnosis in up to one third of young SCD victims and should generally be performed. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Autopsy and molecular genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) should undergo extensive testing to exclude drug or toxin exposure or underlying structural heart disease that may have contributed to SCA. Therapy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should generally be recommended in survivors of SCA.
