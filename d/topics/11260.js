MMS provides high cure rates with maximal preservation of unaffected tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In contrast to standard excision, in which only a small portion of the margins are evaluated, in MMS, specimens are cut in horizontal sections that allow the evaluation of the entire peripheral and deep margins of the tumor.</p><p>The most common malignancies treated with MMS are basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). MMS is also used to remove other skin malignancies such as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), microcystic adnexal carcinoma, extramammary Paget disease (EMPD), and lentigo maligna.</p><p>The MMS technique and its indications will be discussed in this topic review.

It involved the overnight application of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc chloride</a> paste to the tumor, which produced tissue necrosis but retained the microscopic architecture. The devitalized, preserved tissue was subsequently excised in a saucer-shaped layer and marked with colored dyes for orientation and correlation on a map. The specimens were then manually flattened, sectioned in the horizontal plane, and stained for histologic examination. In areas of residual tumor, zinc chloride was reapplied overnight and the process repeated until clear margins were achieved.</p><p>In the following years, Mohs surgery evolved from the fixed-tissue to a &quot;fresh-tissue technique&quot; that used frozen sections of the excised tissue and was initially employed to treat eyelid cancers with a five-year cure rate of 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The fresh-tissue technique allows single-day excision and repair of the surgical defect in most cases and has become the standard technique for Mohs surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9314583\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H887631\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is performed under local anesthesia by a dermatologic surgeon formally trained in dermatology and fellowship trained in MMS, cutaneous oncology, and dermatologic surgery. The tumor is excised at an oblique angle, and the beveled specimen is mapped for orientation, sectioned, and processed into frozen, horizontal sections for microscopic evaluation of the entire peripheral and deep margins. Residual tumor identified on histologic examination is marked on a pictorial map to guide the removal in subsequent stages until negative margins are achieved. Immediate reconstruction is performed in most cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2779618\"><span class=\"h2\">Excision and mapping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical margins of the biopsy-proven skin cancer are carefully marked with a surgical pen using bright illumination. The skin is prepared with an antiseptic, and the site is anesthetized with a local anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 1% combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> 1:100,000 for vasoconstriction). The tumor can be debulked with a semi-sharp instrument (curette) for a better delineation of the tumor extent. Curetting, however, is not effective for morpheaform basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or other nonfriable tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>A saucerized or beveled excision of the tumor is performed with a margin of normal-appearing tissue using a scalpel angled at 45 degrees to the skin surface. The margin and depth of tissue initially excised depend upon tumor features and histologic subtype. Narrow margins of 1 to 2 mm are taken in sensitive areas, whereas larger margins may be necessary for bulky or recurrent tumors.</p><p>For superficial tumors, the initial excision is shallow, whereas for deeply infiltrating cancers the excision depth may extend to the subcutaneous tissue. Before removing the tissue, reference nicks are placed extending from the tissue onto wound edges (eg, at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions) to maintain precise anatomic orientation. A diagram (Mohs map) of the surgical defect with anatomic landmarks and location of reference nicks is created (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F51769\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51769 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The excised tissue and Mohs map are transferred to the Mohs laboratory for frozen tissue processing with careful attention to preserving tissue orientation. The surgical defect is bandaged, and the patient awaits margin examination results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p>Residual tumor identified on histologic examination is marked on a pictorial map to guide the removal in subsequent stages until negative margins are achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2779625\"><span class=\"h2\">Frozen tissue processing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The excised tissue is processed in an adjacent Mohs laboratory by a specially trained histotechnician under the supervision of the Mohs surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The tissue is first subdivided into smaller pieces as necessary to fit onto a cryostat chuck and microscope slide. The pieces are sequentially numbered, and cut edges are color coded with two or more dyes for accurate orientation and identification. The subdivision, numbering, and inking pattern are carefully recorded on the Mohs map.</p><p>To allow the complete examination of the peripheral and deep surgical margins, the angled skin edge is flattened, and the tissue is inverted and oriented such that the deep margin and skin edge are aligned in a horizontal plane. Tissue is cut in a cryostat in the horizontal plane into frozen sections 5 to 7 microns thick. Sectioned tissue is then fixed and stained with routine hematoxylin and eosin or toluidine blue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2779632\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgeon evaluates the frozen section margins for residual skin cancer and marks subclinical tumor extensions on the map. A second layer of tissue is excised from the wound at the exact location of the residual tumor with preservation of uninvolved tissue. The process is repeated until a tumor-free plane is achieved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58386\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58386 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471696\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunostaining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In high-risk skin cancers, immunohistochemical staining may be required for the evaluation of the surgical margins in conjunction with standard staining of frozen sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Rapid immunostains for frozen sections are available, including cytokeratins for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), melan-A (MART-1), microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) for lentigo maligna, and CD34 for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471703\"><span class=\"h2\">Technical pitfalls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The success of MMS can be compromised by pitfalls occurring in any of the many steps of the procedure, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Debulking &ndash; The pre-excision curettage may remove tissue in a nonuniform way, creating jagged margins and floaters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excising &ndash; A bevel angle &gt;45 degrees may interfere with tissue flattening and require relaxing incisions that can interrupt the margin continuity and confuse orientation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creating the map &ndash; There is no standardized way to create a map. Hand-drawn pictures are used by most surgeons to map and orient specimens, although this method may not provide a reliable size and shape of the excised area. Alternative maps such as photographs and pre-drawn diagrams may also be used at the discretion of the surgeon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subdivision and inking &ndash; Tissue lacerations may occur during sectioning and be mistaken for hash marks; ink may be placed on the wrong margin or run over the wrong section.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue processing &ndash; Pitfalls can also occur during flattening, freezing, sectioning, slide fixation, and staining.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2779639\"><span class=\"h1\">RECONSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once Mohs margins are free of cancerous cells, the defect is analyzed to determine the optimal repair technique. Tumor characteristics, location and size of the defect, patient comorbidities, and aesthetic considerations guide the choice of the repair technique.</p><p>Many Mohs surgical defects can be repaired in a linear manner. Superficial wounds in concave areas such as the medial canthus heal well by second intention. Second intention healing may also be an option for skin cancers at high risk for recurrence in which reconstruction may make tumor surveillance difficult.</p><p>Larger defects in anatomically sensitive areas require repair with a full-thickness skin graft or local flap.</p><p>For complex cases with defects involving vital structures, collaboration with a reconstructive surgeon specializing in oculoplastics, otorhinolaryngology, or plastic surgery may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1574000248\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10633554\"><span class=\"h2\">General indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is primarily indicated for the treatment of locally aggressive tumors at high risk for recurrence. The high-risk nature of a cutaneous tumor is determined by tumor characteristics, patient risk factors, and anatomic site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54886\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54886 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Certain anatomic locations offer less resistance to tumor invasion and are associated with deeper and more irregular growth patterns.

High-risk BCCs include tumors &ge;6 mm located in high-risk areas (central face, nose, lips, eyelids, eyebrows, periorbital skin, chin, mandible, ears, preauricular and postauricular areas, temples, hands, feet); &ge;10 mm in other areas of the face (cheeks, forehead, scalp, and neck); tumors &ge;20 mm on trunk or limbs; or tumors with aggressive pathologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence#H12329758\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of basal cell carcinomas at high risk for recurrence&quot;, section on 'Features associated with high risk for recurrence'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma</strong> &ndash; Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common skin cancer treated with MMS. High-risk SCCs (eg, tumors &ge;20 mm, involving high-risk areas of the face such as ears and lips, or tumors showing perineural invasion or poor histologic differentiation) are effectively treated with MMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Because the microscopic extension of DFSP is unpredictable, large defects and numerous tissue sections are often required to achieve negative margins. Reconstruction frequently is delayed by the need for excision of a &quot;final&quot; margin that is sent for paraffin-embedded permanent sections and immunohistochemistry. Some surgeons perform a modified &quot;slow&quot; MMS that uses paraffin-embedded permanent sections. However, in contrast to the frozen section processing time of one to two hours, paraffin sections require a minimum of 24 to 48 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microcystic adnexal carcinoma</strong> &ndash; Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare tumor of sweat glands that typically occurs in the head and neck region of older adults. This deeply infiltrative tumor with frequent perineural invasion has a locally aggressive behavior and a high tendency to recur after wide local excision (WLE). Recurrence rates with MMS range from 0 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microcystic adnexal carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extramammary Paget disease</strong> &ndash; Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a slow-growing, rare apocrine carcinoma that usually occurs on the genitalia and less commonly the axilla. The recurrence rate is high after WLE, despite negative margins. Observational studies indicate that treatment with MMS may be associated with lower recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-cancer-epidemiology-diagnosis-histopathology-and-treatment-of-rare-histologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar cancer: Epidemiology, diagnosis, histopathology, and treatment of rare histologies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Melanoma</strong> &ndash; The use of Mohs surgery for treatment of melanoma remains controversial. There are no clinical trials comparing WLE with MMS. In a consecutive series of 625 patients with head and neck melanoma treated with MMS and followed up for a mean of 58 months, recurrence, metastasis, and disease-specific survival rates were similar or better than historical controls treated with WLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Similar results were observed in a single-institution retrospective study comparing the outcome of 277 patients with melanoma in situ treated with WLE with that of 385 patients treated with MMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. After a median follow-up time of 8.6 years (range 0.2 to 37 years), the overall recurrence rates and the melanoma-specific mortality rates were not significantly different for patients treated with WLE and those treated with MMS (5.7 versus 1.8 percent and 3.4 versus 0.7 percent, respectively). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;, section on 'Experimental approaches'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lentigo</strong> <strong>maligna</strong> &ndash; MMS may be a treatment option for lentigo maligna, a type of melanoma in situ, because of its poorly defined clinical borders, unpredictable subclinical extension, head and neck location requiring tissue conservation, and propensity for recurrence. However, margin assessment with frozen sections can be problematic in lentigo maligna [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a study of 167 patients with melanoma in situ or lentigo maligna, approximately 5 percent of samples with negative margins on frozen sections were positive on permanent sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. To overcome the limitations of frozen sections, some Mohs surgeons excise and map lentigo maligna with the Mohs technique but process the tissue with en face paraffin-embedded permanent sections (&quot;slow&quot; MMS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lentigo-maligna-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lentigo maligna: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other tumors</strong> &ndash; Mohs surgery has been used to treat many other skin tumors, including sebaceous carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, verrucous carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, angiosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sebaceous-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sebaceous carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atypical-fibroxanthoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atypical fibroxanthoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keratoacanthoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keratoacanthoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-sarcomas#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Angiosarcoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Detailed criteria for appropriate use of MMS covering 270 clinical scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice have been developed by the American Academy of Dermatology in collaboration with the American College of Mohs Surgery, the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery Association, and the American Society for Mohs Surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9483386\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9483394\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Mohs technique offers several advantages over standard surgical excision and pathology processing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71211\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71211 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Better clinicopathologic management of skin cancer.

It requires a highly qualified clinician with expertise in the management of high-risk skin cancers, an experienced histotechnician with specific training in Mohs frozen tissue processing, a fully certified Mohs laboratory, and well-trained nursing staff.</p><p>MMS is also a time-consuming process that requires patient cooperation and understanding. A typical procedure lasts two to four hours, and more complicated cases can take longer. A significant amount of the total time is spent on histologic preparation and analysis. If the patient has serious and labile medical problems or is unwilling to undergo surgery, nonsurgical alternatives such as radiation may be warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9483408\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some instances, complete tumor eradication is not possible with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). This may occur when an aggressive skin cancer invades a vital structure and further excision with local anesthesia alone is not feasible in an office setting. In those cases, referral to a specialized surgical oncologist is necessary.</p><p>Skin cancers with perineural invasion, such as squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), can recur despite achieving tumor-free margins on Mohs frozen sections. A break in tumor continuity can result in a false-negative Mohs margin and occurs most frequently in recurrent tumors with scar tissue and fibrosis obscuring residual tumor. False-negative Mohs margins can also occur in tumors with potential for skip areas such as superficial basal cell carcinomas (BCC).</p><p>Frozen section slides may be more difficult to interpret than paraffin-embedded permanent sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mohs-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Dense inflammation can be confused with cancer cells or can mask cancerous tissue. Differentiating a BCC from a benign basaloid proliferation or an adnexal structure (eg, trichoepithelioma or tangentially sectioned hair follicle) may be difficult.

(See <a href=\"#H18481607\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), tumors are excised under local anesthesia at an oblique angle and mapped on a diagram of the surgical defect. The excised tissue is processed into frozen horizontal sections that allow the histologic evaluation of the entire peripheral and deep margins. Subclinical tumor extensions are precisely marked on the map. A second layer of tissue is subsequently excised at the exact location of the residual tumor with preservation of uninvolved tissue. The process is repeated until negative margins are achieved. Immediate reconstruction is performed in most cases. (See <a href=\"#H887631\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mohs surgery is most commonly performed to treat basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas (BCC and SCC) at high risk of recurrence. Mohs surgery is also indicated for other skin malignancies such as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), microcystic adnexal carcinoma, and extramammary Paget disease (EMPD), and for lentigo maligna. (See <a href=\"#H1574000248\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-basal-cell-carcinomas-at-high-risk-for-recurrence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of basal cell carcinomas at high risk for recurrence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition and management of high-risk (aggressive) cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microcystic-adnexal-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microcystic adnexal carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lentigo-maligna-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lentigo maligna: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mohs surgery offers several advantages over standard surgical excision, including lower recurrence rates for high-risk tumors, maximal tissue preservation in cosmetically and anatomically sensitive areas, and immediate reconstruction in most cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71211\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71211 \">table 2</a>). However, Mohs surgery is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that requires a highly qualified clinician with expertise in the management of high-risk skin cancers, a fully certified Mohs laboratory, and specifically trained histotechnician and nursing staff. (See <a href=\"#H9483386\" class=\"local\">'Advantages and disadvantages'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mohs surgery is generally a safe procedure with overall complication rates lower than 3 percent. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not needed in most Mohs surgery procedures. However, we suggest antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at high risk of surgical-site infection; patients at high risk of infective endocarditis or hematogenous total joint infection, if surgery involves the oral mucosa; or if the surgical site is infected before the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H473134\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulation is generally safe in patients undergoing MMS if the international normalized ratio (INR) is maintained within the therapeutic range. The reported rates of local complications among patients undergoing Mohs surgery while on anticoagulants range from 1 to 3 percent. In contrast, the risk of thromboembolic events increases even after a short period of suspension of anticoagulant therapy. Given the balance of risks and benefits, we suggest that anticoagulant therapy be continued for patients undergoing Mohs surgery.
