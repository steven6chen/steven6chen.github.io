This parasite is carried by a certain kind of bug, called a &quot;triatomine bug&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F97524\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97524 \">picture 1</a>). These are sometimes called &quot;reduviid bugs&quot; or &quot;kissing bugs.&quot;</p><p>Chagas disease is common in Mexico, Central America, and South America. It is very rare to get the disease in the United States or other parts of the world. Chagas disease is also called &quot;American trypanosomiasis.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1902918734\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Chagas disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chagas disease has two phases, the &quot;acute phase&quot; and the &quot;chronic phase.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute phase</strong> &ndash; The acute phase happens soon after a person is infected, and lasts for up to a few months. During this time, the infected person might not have any symptoms or might just feel tired or unwell. Some people get swelling where the infection entered the body through the skin. In <strong>very rare</strong> cases, acute Chagas disease leads to inflammation in the heart or brain. This can be serious.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic phase</strong> &ndash; The chronic phase begins once there are no (or very few) parasites left in the person's system. Most people have no symptoms during this time. But some people (2 or 3 out of every 10) will eventually have problems, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heart problems &ndash; These can include an irregular heartbeat, heart failure (when the heart does not pump as well as it should), blood clots, and chest pain. Heart problems can also cause dizziness or fainting. In some cases, the heart can stop beating suddenly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Digestive problems &ndash; The muscles in the digestive tract can stop working normally. The esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) and the colon (large intestine) can bulge out and get wider than usual. This can cause problems with eating and digesting food.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1902918768\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you live in an area where Chagas disease is common, and you think you might have it, call your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1902918788\"><span class=\"h1\">How does Chagas disease spread?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common way to get infected is to be bitten by a bug that has the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The bugs often live in houses made of mud or clay, where there are cracks in the floors, walls, or ceilings.</p><p>Chagas disease can also be spread through:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mother passing it on to her baby (when the baby is born)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receiving blood or organs from someone who was infected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating or drinking something with the parasite in it</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1902918801\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I worry about Chagas disease if I am traveling?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Most people who get Chagas disease have spent years living around the bugs that carry the infection. You are very unlikely to get it from taking a trip to Mexico, Central America, or South America.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1902918814\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Chagas disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There is a blood test that can check a person's blood for the parasite that causes Chagas disease. If it has been several months since the person was infected, he or she is probably in the &quot;chronic phase.&quot; In this case, there are different blood tests that can tell if a person has the disease.</p><p>If blood tests show that you have Chagas disease, your doctor or nurse will probably do other tests, too. These include imaging tests to check for problems with your heart or digestive system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1902918827\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Chagas disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are medicines available to treat Chagas disease. These medicines kill the parasite that causes the infection. They are available in most countries where Chagas disease is common. In the United States, they are only available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>These medicines are usually given to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anyone with Chagas disease in the acute phase</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children (under 18) with Chagas disease in the chronic phase. Some adults with early chronic Chagas disease might also get these medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Babies who were infected with Chagas disease at birth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with Chagas disease who also have other problems with their immune systems (for example, HIV infection)</p><p/><p>Medicines that kill parasites do <strong>not</strong> fix the heart or digestive problems caused by Chagas disease. Once these problems have happened, they are permanent. But there are treatments that can help with the symptoms. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of heart problems &ndash; These might include medicines to treat heart failure or an abnormal heartbeat, or to prevent blood clots. Some people might need a pacemaker (a device that helps the heart beat normally).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of digestive problems &ndash; These might include medicines, changes in diet, or surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1902918841\"><span class=\"h1\">Can Chagas disease be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are things you can do to help prevent Chagas disease. If you live in a place where the disease is common, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sleeping in buildings made of mud or clay, where infected bugs often live. If you can't avoid it, you can protect your bed or sleeping area with netting that has been treated with bug spray.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your home sprayed with chemicals to kill bugs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1987991660\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-and-atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure and atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pacemakers (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilated-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dilated cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donation-and-transfusion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood donation and transfusion (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
