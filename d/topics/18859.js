These observations led to the clinical use of glucocorticoids to reverse severe renal transplant rejection.</p><p>The combined administration of glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> was subsequently introduced as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Significant benefits with this regimen helped transform transplantation from an experimental, infrequently used procedure to a widespread, extremely successful clinical option.</p><p>Most transplant centers administer large doses of glucocorticoids perioperatively and immediately postoperatively. This usually consists of a &quot;pulse&quot; intraoperative dose of 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, which is followed by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. This is subsequently tapered to approximately 0.05 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of prednisone by one year or less. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the immunosuppressive benefits derived from this glucocorticoid regimen are counterbalanced by the possible induction of numerous major adverse effects (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>). These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortical bone mass quickly declines, possibly leading to osteopenia, skeletal fractures, and avascular necrosis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other significant adverse effects include an enhanced risk of cataract formation, hypertension, and obesity.</p><p>To minimize toxicity and decrease overall immunosuppression, tapering and ultimate withdrawal of glucocorticoids has been attempted. Cessation of glucocorticoid therapy is often associated with a fall in blood pressure and, in diabetic patients, better glycemic control; total cholesterol levels also fall, but there is an equivalent reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and, therefore, an uncertain effect on cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities after renal transplantation&quot;</a>). Prevention of osteopenia and aseptic necrosis of bone are other potential benefits; there are, however, limited data to confirm these results.</p><p>Minimizing glucocorticoid use in the setting of organ transplantation has therefore been a goal for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In the United States, in 2004, glucocorticoid avoidance regimens were administered to 23 percent of all first kidney transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among those discharged on glucocorticoids (approximately 77 percent), approximately 10 percent had glucocorticoids completely withdrawn by one year posttransplant. Further, in 2007, approximately 30 percent of kidney transplant recipients were discharged on an immunosuppressive regimen that did not include corticosteroids, and this percentage has remained constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Thus, although glucocorticoids are administered to the majority of kidney transplant recipients, strategies aimed at minimizing or avoiding these agents are increasingly used.</p><p>A review of glucocorticoid withdrawal or avoidance in the renal transplant patient with stable renal function is presented here. Withdrawal of immunosuppression in the patient with a failed renal allograft is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withdrawal-of-immunosuppression-after-renal-transplant-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withdrawal of immunosuppression after renal transplant failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MINIMIZING GLUCOCORTICOID USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with conventional immunosuppressive regimens, exposure to glucocorticoids can be further minimized via several different strategies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower doses administered earlier after transplantation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete withdrawal, which can either be performed early after transplantation (approximately three to six months postsurgery) or at a later time (after one year)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete avoidance, which most frequently has been utilized with a calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimen and polyclonal antibody induction therapy</p><p/><p>The effectiveness of such strategies is dependent in part upon the ability of the remaining nonglucocorticoid immunosuppressive agents to suppress the anti-allograft immune response. The continuing introduction of more selective and possibly improved immunosuppressive agents (compared with traditional drugs), such as targeted-antibody preparations, may eventually permit a completely glucocorticoid-free maintenance regimen.</p><p>An increasingly large number of registry studies and meta-analyses have been published concerning the outcomes associated with minimizing glucocorticoid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. In general, the risk of acute rejection is markedly increased with the withdrawal of corticosteroids weeks to months after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, some claim that overall benefits may be found in certain patients if corticosteroids are discontinued during the first week after transplantation. As an example, the 2009 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines suggest that corticosteroids may be discontinued during the first week after transplantation in patients who are at low immunologic risk and who also receive induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>We do not agree with the KDIGO guidelines. Overall, we consider that the published evidence suggests that low-dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued indefinitely at low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> of 5 mg per day. Many of the trials that have shown benefit with glucocorticoid avoidance or are ongoing have evaluated short-term outcomes in patients at relatively low risk of adverse outcomes. Many of these avoidance trials are also enrolling a low number of African Americans, a group at particularly high risk of rejection. Outcomes are significantly affected by these strategies, a subject that is discussed in the relevant sections elsewhere within this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Very low dose maintenance therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As previously mentioned, most centers attempt to taper glucocorticoids to approximately 0.05 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (or even less) by one year or sooner. In the absence of acute rejection, for example, we generally reduce glucocorticoids to a dose of 5 mg per day by one month following kidney transplantation. Overall, the benefit of maintenance low-dose glucocorticoids at the doses utilized may include improved immunosuppression, modulation of calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ability to avoid calcineurin inhibitor use.</p><p>Such doses are associated with decreased rejection and avoidance of chronic kidney allograft nephropathy compared with early steroid <span class=\"nowrap\">withdrawal/avoidance</span>. This was best shown in the only prospective, well-designed study that compared very early steroid cessation to low-dose, long-term steroid therapy in kidney recipients receiving modern maintenance immunosuppression. In this trial, 386 patients were randomly assigned to corticosteroid withdrawal at one week posttransplant (CSWD) or continuance of corticosteroids (CCS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. All patients received antibody induction therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a> (68 percent) or intereukin-2 receptor antibody (32 percent). Maintenance therapy consisted of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, and seven days of corticosteroids followed by blinded randomization to either the CSWD group or a CCS group that was tapered to 5 milligrams of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> daily by six months after transplant.</p><p>At follow-up at five years, the following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no significant difference in the primary composite endpoint (death, allograft loss, or <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> rejection) or in any of the individual components.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The very early withdrawal group was associated with significant increases in the incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy (10 versus 4 percent), as well as biopsy-proven acute rejection (18 versus 11 percent). Given that the rate of <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> rejection was similar in the two groups, these findings suggest that very early withdrawal increased the risk of mild rejection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In terms of corticosteroid-associated side effects, there were no significant differences in blood pressure, new-onset diabetes, serum cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and rates of bone fracture or cataracts.</p><p/><p>Although the authors concluded that very early withdrawal is safe and provides similar five-year renal allograft outcomes, this strategy resulted in double the rate of chronic allograft nephropathy compared with continuance of corticosteroid therapy. These findings suggest that continued maintenance therapy is preferred to very early withdrawal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Summary and recommendations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawal several weeks to months after surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of glucocorticoid withdrawal within several weeks to months after surgery were quickly realized to be accompanied by a significantly increased risk of acute rejection and possible decreased long-term allograft survival. This is particularly true if withdrawal is performed less than three to six months after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>In general, early cessation of glucocorticoids is associated with an increased incidence of acute rejection and a possible decrease in long-term (more than two years) graft survival. As a result, early glucocorticoid withdrawal or avoidance has been abandoned by most transplant centers for the majority of patients. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Summary and recommendations'</a> below.)</p><p>The adverse effects of early withdrawal upon allograft survival appear to emerge only after an extended period of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/18,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,21</a>]. In some studies, such immunosuppressive strategies did not affect early (less than two years) allograft survival. By comparison, significantly decreased long-term survival was reported in a multicenter Canadian trial, which evaluated the outcome of 523 stable transplant recipients who were randomly assigned at day 90 following renal transplant to placebo or alternate-day <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Adverse allograft survival results associated with total glucocorticoid withdrawal were not evident until follow-up at <strong>five</strong> years (73 and 85 percent for the placebo and prednisone groups, respectively).</p><p>The success with glucocorticoid withdrawal may depend in part upon the effectiveness of the remaining agents that constitute the immunosuppressive regimen. Studies evaluating glucocorticoid withdrawal in patients treated with calcineurin inhibitors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil have largely shown worse outcomes, except in patients receiving antilymphocyte induction therapy or in patients at low to standard risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/21,23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawal years after transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of studies evaluating withdrawal at later time points are conflicting, demonstrating the need for caution concerning any glucocorticoid withdrawal regimen. We believe that there is little long-term benefit and a small but clear <strong>risk</strong> observed in patients withdrawn from small doses of glucocorticoids after one year. Patients chosen for glucocorticoid withdrawal at our center have a low risk profile and an identifiable potential benefit for withdrawal. Thus, we have withdrawn glucocorticoids after one year in less than 1 percent of renal transplant patients at our center.</p><p>The following is an overview of some of the studies that have examined this issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/11,29-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29-36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis published in 2000 of 20 glucocorticoid withdrawal studies reported that withdrawal was also associated with a <strong>higher</strong> relative risk of graft failure (relative risk = 1.34) and an <strong>increased</strong> risk of acute rejection (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These adverse results were worse than those from studies evaluating the outcomes of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> withdrawal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large, prospective, but nonrandomized, European study reported that glucocorticoid withdrawal may result in improved graft and patient survival versus that observed with matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In this multicenter study, 1110 cadaveric kidney recipients underwent slow glucocorticoid withdrawal after at least six months posttransplantation. Matched controls selected from the database by the investigators were derived from the Collaborative Transplant study database. Both groups were similar, including a low risk for rejection, except that the controls had lower serum creatinine concentrations (less than 1.47 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [130 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> versus less than 2.94 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [260 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> for the withdrawal patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At seven years, superior benefits with withdrawal were noted for graft survival (82 versus 75 percent), patient survival (89 versus 84 percent), and death-censored graft survival (92 versus 88 percent). There were no differences in rates of acute rejection and allograft dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although intriguing because of demonstrable clinical benefit (better bone density in the withdrawal group), significant limitations of this study include the lack of randomization, heterogeneous immunosuppressive regimens, and loose guidelines for timing and duration of glucocorticoid withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

In one study, 212 patients receiving triple immunosuppressive therapy consisting of mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg twice daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (trough level of 125 to 175 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (without antibody induction therapy) were randomly assigned at six months posttransplant to prednisone withdrawal, cyclosporine withdrawal, or continued triple therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. At two years posttransplant, the incidence of biopsy-proven acute and chronic rejection was higher in the prednisone-withdrawal than the control group (4 and 1.4 percent for acute and 5 and 1.4 percent for chronic rejection, respectively); by comparison, the cyclosporine-withdrawal group had a significantly higher incidence of acute and chronic rejection (22 and 14 percent, respectively). At 18 months after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy, the prednisone-withdrawal group, compared with controls, had a lower mean blood pressure and similar renal function and patient and graft survival.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid-free regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although glucocorticoid avoidance is popular, it is unlikely to provide the best overall risk-to-benefit ratio with maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation.

Several centers routinely discontinue glucocorticoids, while others continue maintenance glucocorticoids indefinitely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/72-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-75</a>]. The use of polyclonal antibody induction therapy appears to facilitate glucocorticoid withdrawal.</p><p>Our policy is to individualize therapy based upon a careful assessment of the risk-benefit ratio. In general, our opinion is that, in most patients, long-term calcineurin inhibitor toxicity outweighs the long-term toxicity of low-dose glucocorticoids. We therefore administer low-dose glucocorticoid therapy indefinitely as part of the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid minimization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of acute rejection, there is little utility in maintaining patients on large doses of glucocorticoids or in tapering glucocorticoids over prolonged periods of time. We therefore reduce the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose to 20 mg daily on postoperative day 3, with tapering to 5 mg daily by five weeks following transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawal several months after surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not recommend early withdrawal (less than six months following transplantation) in the majority of patients. This is because the benefits of withdrawal have not been consistently reproduced, and there is a clear risk of acute rejection and decreased renal function. The long-term effect of glucocorticoid withdrawal is unknown.</p><p>If early glucocorticoid withdrawal is attempted, it seems prudent to only do so in those who have received lymphocyte-depleting therapy with antithymocyte globulin and possibly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>. The data to support alemtuzumab are limited. It is thus prudent to monitor these patients aggressively, perhaps even with protocol biopsies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Late withdrawal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is less clear whether late withdrawal (greater than one year) should or should not be recommended. The failure of withdrawal in up to 40 percent of patients in most studies emphasizes the need for caution. Late withdrawal has been successfully performed in some centers, but its effect upon long-term allograft function and the risk of chronic rejection has not been conclusively evaluated. Several studies have also suggested that many patients do not obtain any substantial, clinically significant benefit by eliminating low-dose glucocorticoid therapy. In addition, methods of identifying candidates who will suffer adverse renal consequences from withdrawal are not available.</p><p>Successful withdrawal protocols use a slow taper over a two- to four-month period. With stable patients, one successful regimen is to taper the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> every week until the dose is 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> which is then changed to 10 mg every other day, with a weekly reduction of 1 mg every other day until the dose is completely tapered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A second protocol reduces the dose every two weeks by 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> until the prednisone dose is tapered to zero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>We believe that there is little long-term benefit and a small but clear <strong>risk</strong> observed in patients withdrawn from small doses of glucocorticoids after one year. Patients chosen for glucocorticoid withdrawal at our center have a low risk profile and an identifiable potential benefit for withdrawal. Thus, we have withdrawn glucocorticoids after one year in less than 1 percent of renal transplant patients at our center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid avoidance may eventually be found to provide the best overall risk-to-benefit ratio with maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation. Glucocorticoid avoidance protocols have been used successfully and are undergoing extensive evaluation.</p><p>However, many of these protocols, although not all, and other anecdotal reports have chosen low-risk individuals and utilized aggressive lymphocyte-depleting induction therapy. In addition, if decreases in the intensity of immunosuppression are needed in some patients with these regimens (consisting of dual therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor and an antimetabolite) because of an infectious event or drug toxicity, the next alternative for maintenance immunosuppressive therapy is monotherapy. We cannot universally recommend glucocorticoid&ndash;free immunosuppressive regimens based on the best evidence-based data.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Brent LA.
