The clinical assessment of wounds begins with a determination of whether the wound is acute or chronic in nature. Acute wounds are those in which healing is anticipated to progress through an orderly physiologic sequence of inflammation, proliferation, and maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-wounds/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. A chronic wound may be defined as one that is physiologically impaired because of inadequate angiogenesis, impaired innervation, or impaired cellular migration, among other reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-wounds/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Examples of chronic wounds include ischemic ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and infected wounds, including surgical site infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-wounds/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Healed chronic wounds, particularly diabetic foot ulcers, should be considered &quot;wounds in remission&quot; and at very high risk for recurrence. &#160;</p><p>The clinical assessment of acute and chronic wounds, including differentiating the most common chronic ulcers, will be reviewed.

Have there been any qualitative changes (size, drainage) to the wound over time? What is the current wound care regimen? Have any other treatments been tried? Is the wound painful? How severe is the pain? It is important to realize that patients with neuropathy can have pain, which may indicate involvement of deeper structures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior wound history &ndash; Ask the patient about the presence of prior wounds or ulcers.

Photography may be helpful for documentation and can be an important part of ongoing wound assessment. The use of objective wound photography decreases interobserver variability and allows for consistent and accurate assessment of changes in wound area over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-wounds/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Wound location, length, width, depth, and the presence and position of undermining, dried necrotic wound surface (ie, eschar) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109446\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109446 \">picture 1</a>), presence of cellulitis, and drainage (amount, type, color, odor) should also be documented. A subjective assessment of greatest depth of tissue penetration should also be performed. Has the wound penetrated the dermis or a deep fascial layer? Does the wound probe to the level of bone? Probing to bone is best performed with a metal-tipped probe; a wooden probe (eg, cotton-tip applicator) often does not adequately differentiate between bone and other periosseous structures. </p><p>Calculation of wound area or volume should be performed and documented at each patient visit. After sharp debridement, measure and record the longest wound length, width, and depth. The rate of wound healing, as assessed by the percent change in wound area over time, may be predictive of wound healing potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-wounds/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1296099921\"><span class=\"h3\">Signs of serious infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute wounds, including those from suspected surgical site infections, should be clinically assessed in the same manner with particular attention directed to the surrounding skin. Virtually all wounds are colonized with bacteria, and a diagnosis of acute, invasive infection is a clinical diagnosis and not a microbiological one. Periwound induration, cellulitis extending &gt;2 cm beyond the margin of the wound, increased local temperature, pain on palpation, and drainage from the site are all signs of acute infection and may indicate an underlying abscess that would benefit from decompression, drainage, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> debridement.

A thorough vascular exam should be performed. Signs of arterial obstruction include lack of peripheral pulses with poor capillary refill, thin atrophic skin, lack of hair on the feet and lower leg, and hypertrophic deformed nails. </p><p>Noninvasive diagnostic options for arterial assessment include the ankle-brachial index, duplex ultrasound, segmental blood pressures, and plethysmography. Noninvasive vascular testing should be performed in patients who present with a wound and have an abnormal pulse examination and in patients with a nonhealing extremity wound or ulcer.

Prealbumin and albumin are not perfect markers of nutritional status but should be evaluated for any patient with a nonhealing wound. &#160;</p><p>Wound cultures should only be obtained in the presence of acute local signs of infection (as described above) to help guide antibiotic therapy. Wound infection is a clinical diagnosis, and wound cultures should not be used as a substitute for clinical judgment. If a culture is indicated, the sample should be obtained after a wound has been thoroughly cleansed and debrided; collection of deep tissue for culture is recommended over superficially swabbing the wound base or collecting drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-wounds/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55267256\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIATION OF CHRONIC ULCERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to differentiate the various types of chronic ulcers since their pathophysiology and, thus, management pathways differ. Characteristic clinical location and appearance usually allow for clear distinction between venous, pressure-related, diabetic, and ischemic ulcers. In addition, although there are many potential etiologies of chronic wounds with varying characteristics, wound biopsy should be considered in any wound that has been present for greater than approximately three months to rule out malignancy such as squamous cell carcinoma.

Nonischemic diabetic foot ulcers are due to a combination of foot deformities and neuropathy preventing the sensation of pain in areas of the foot that are traumatized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the diabetic foot&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Characteristics of nonischemic diabetic foot ulcers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location at areas of repeated trauma, such as the plantar metatarsal heads or dorsal interphalangeal joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overgrowth of hyperkeratotic tissue (corns or callouses) on other regions of the foot.

This assessment (Wound, Ischemia, Foot Infection), takes on the acronym &quot;WIfI.&quot; Each part of the assessment can be graded as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). This then provides a simple, validated method of communication between clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-wounds/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Up to 40 percent will recur at one year, nearly 66 percent at three years, 75 percent at five years, and 80 to 100 percent at a decade. Therefore, the term &quot;diabetic foot remission&quot; is used during this period, with the expressed goal of increasing ulcer-free and activity-rich days. This can be done with a host of technologies and treatments, including shoes, insoles, bracing, surgery, physical therapy, and home temperature monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-wounds/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1073280441\" class=\"local\">'Wound assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further vascular testing may be indicated for patients with chronic wounds who have an abnormal pulse examination or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H441345442\" class=\"local\">'Vascular assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For consistent and accurate assessment of changes in wound area over time with treatment, we suggest using objective wound photography, which decreases interobserver variability (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1073280441\" class=\"local\">'Wound assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differentiation of the various types of chronic ulcers is important since pathophysiology, and thus management, differs. Characteristic clinical location and appearance usually allow clear distinction between venous ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and ischemic ulcers. (See <a href=\"#H55267256\" class=\"local\">'Differentiation of chronic ulcers'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management#H55268937\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;, section on 'Management of specific wounds'</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-assessment-of-wounds/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Atiyeh BS, Ioannovich J, Al-Amm CA, El-Musa KA.
