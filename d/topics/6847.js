Almost everyone has experienced vertigo as the transient spinning dizziness immediately after turning around rapidly several times. Vertigo can also be a sense of swaying or tilting. Some perceive self-motion whereas others perceive motion of the environment.</p><p>Vertigo is a symptom, not a diagnosis. It arises because of asymmetry in the vestibular system due to damage to or dysfunction of the labyrinth, vestibular nerve, or central vestibular structures in the brainstem.</p><p>Vertigo is a troubling problem for many clinicians because it is symptomatic of a large range of diagnoses from benign to immediately life threatening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66539\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66539 \">table 1</a>). However, in most cases, the clinical history, especially the tempo of the symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81596 \">table 2</a>), with examination findings that distinguish between central and peripheral etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76359 \">table 3</a>) identify those patients that require urgent diagnostic evaluation.</p><p>Vertigo is only one type of dizziness. Other symptoms that patients may identify as dizziness include presyncopal faintness, disequilibrium, and nonspecific or ill-defined light-headedness. The initial approach to the patient who complains of dizziness is to localize the cause of the symptom into one of these broad categories. This is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-dizziness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with dizziness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical approach to a patient with vertigo. The pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment of vertigo are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-etiology-and-differential-diagnosis-of-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, etiology, and differential diagnosis of vertigo&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19187820\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19187879\"><span class=\"h2\">Vertigo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vertigo is the predominant symptom of vestibular dysfunction. Patients often experience vertigo as an illusion of motion; some interpret this as self-motion, others as motion of the environment. The most common motion illusion is a spinning sensation. A spinning sensation is not required; vertigo can also be a sense of swaying or tilting. Also, not all patients are able to describe their vertigo in such concrete terms. Vague dizziness, imbalance, or disorientation may eventually prove to be due to a vestibular problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. On the other hand, some patients with presyncope sometimes interpret the woozy, faint feeling as a spinning sensation. Thus, a symptom of vertigo is not a perfectly sensitive or specific for a vestibular problem.</p><p>Severe vertigo may occur with both acute central and peripheral lesions. However, when symptoms are less pronounced, particularly when there is pronounced nystagmus out of proportion to the severity of vertigo, this strongly suggests a brainstem rather than a peripheral lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19187899\"><span class=\"h2\">Nausea and vomiting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nausea and vomiting are typical with acute vertigo, unless it is mild or very brief, as with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vomiting can be severe, causing dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Severe nausea and vomiting are more common with peripheral than central lesions but can occur with both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19187919\"><span class=\"h2\">Postural and gait instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postural stability can be affected in patients with vertigo. The vestibular nuclei send signals to the vestibulospinal tract, which in turn stimulates antigravity muscles that maintain posture.</p><p>The effects of unilateral lesions of the vestibular apparatus upon postural stability are variable. In general, vertigo of central origin impairs gait and posture to a greater degree than does vertigo of peripheral origin, probably because central etiologies likely also impair other pathways involved in balance and posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Patients with vertigo of peripheral origin are usually able to walk, but may be very reluctant to move.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19188085\"><span class=\"h2\">Other symptoms of vestibular dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with vestibular injury may not complain of vertigo. In fact, vertigo is unusual in chronic vestibular injury or acute, bilaterally symmetric vestibular injury. Other symptoms of vestibular injury may include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19188091\"><span class=\"h3\">Tilt illusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A tilt illusion in which patients feel that they and their environment are tilted with respect to gravity, even to the point of being upside down, usually reflects damage to otolithic organs (utricle and saccule) or their central connections. Otolith dysfunction may also cause lateropulsion or the tendency to fall to the side of the lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19188097\"><span class=\"h3\">Drop attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with drop attacks of vestibular origin often have a sensation of being pushed or pulled to the ground [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Unlike presyncope and seizures, there is no faintness or loss of consciousness with drop attacks. </p><p>Drop attacks are often attributed to a sudden loss of tone mediated by vestibulospinal reflexes, but can have other causes as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in older adults: Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Drop attacks'</a>.)</p><p>Drop attacks are an unusual feature of Meniere disease. Sometimes called Tumarkins' otolithic crises, this symptom is usually seen only in advanced cases. Superior canal dehiscence and aminoglycoside toxicity are also associated with this presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19188155\"><span class=\"h3\">Spatial disorientation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fleeting spatial disorientation with rapid head turns often remains after the patient has recovered from an acute attack of vertigo. The most astute patients will observe that this is more pronounced with head turns to the side of the lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19188161\"><span class=\"h3\">Oscillopsia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oscillopsia, a visual illusion of to-and-fro environmental motion, and blurred vision whenever the head is in motion is a manifestation of an impaired vestibuloocular reflex. Affected patients notice that everything jiggles when they are walking or driving on rough pavement; they often have to stop and stand still to read signs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19188167\"><span class=\"h3\">Impaired balance without vertigo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is a common manifestation of acute simultaneous bilateral vestibular loss such as that occurring with aminoglycoside antibiotic toxicity. Vertigo does not occur because there is no marked vestibular asymmetry. Most patients have oscillopsia during passive head movement, as when walking or riding in a car over rough terrain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Imbalance is most marked in the dark when visual cues to position in space are not available. Aminoglycoside toxicity is the most common identified etiology of bilateral vestibulopathy, followed by Meniere disease and meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Bilateral vestibular failure is also a key feature of CANVAS (cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Most cases, however, are cryptogenic in origin. This presentation is also characteristic of acute midline cerebellar lesions or thiamine deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wernicke-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wernicke encephalopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cerebellar-ataxia-in-adults#H3280968\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cerebellar ataxia in adults&quot;, section on 'Autosomal recessive ataxias'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19188199\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should allow the clinician to distinguish vertigo from other types of dizziness and to make a hypothesis about the site and type of lesion. It is customary to organize causes of vertigo into peripheral and central disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66539\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66539 \">table 1</a>). These have distinctive clinical features, but with some overlap. The clinical features of the most common disorders are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81596 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Time course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vertigo is never a permanent, continuous symptom. Even when the vestibular lesion is permanent, the central nervous system adapts to the defect so that vertigo subsides over days or weeks. Constant dizziness lasting months is not vestibular. However, some patients describe constant dizziness but actually mean that they have a constant susceptibility to frequent episodic dizziness.</p><p>Vertigo can occur as single or recurrent episodes and may last seconds, hours, or days. This time course of symptoms provides one of the best clues to the underlying pathophysiology of vertigo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81596 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent vertigo lasting under one minute is usually benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single episode of vertigo lasting several minutes to hours may be due to migraine or to transient ischemia of the labyrinth or brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recurrent episodes of vertigo associated with Meniere disease or recurrent vestibulopathy also typically last hours but can be briefer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More prolonged, severe episodes of vertigo that occur with vestibular neuritis can last for days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Many patients in the midst of a vertiginous attack may be petrified to move. If head motion does not worsen the feeling, it is probably another type of dizziness. This feature does not distinguish causes of vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Attacks of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are often provoked with specific head movements or postures (eg, rolling over in bed, extending the neck).</p><p>Vertigo aggravated by coughing, sneezing, exertion, or loud noises (Tullio phenomenon) should raise suspicion of either a perilymphatic fistula, in which there is an abnormal connection between the middle ear and the perilymphatic space of the inner ear, or a superior canal dehiscence, in which there is a defect in the roof of the superior canal. Both conditions allow pressure to be transmitted from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space to the inner ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-etiology-and-differential-diagnosis-of-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, etiology, and differential diagnosis of vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Head trauma is an important historical feature and can produce vertigo by a variety of mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;</a>.) Barotrauma, middle ear surgery, and straining with weight lifting and bowel movements have also been reported to produce a perilymphatic fistula.</p><p>Recent hyperextension injury to the neck, usually with persistent neck pain, suggests the possibility of vertebral artery dissection with brainstem or labyrinthine ischemia.</p><p>Recent viral symptoms may suggest acute vestibular neuritis, which is believed to be produced by viral or postviral inflammation of the eighth cranial nerve. However, a history of recent viral illness is both nonspecific and insensitive; less than one-half of patients with vestibular neuritis will report this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/14,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of associated symptoms may help to distinguish the etiology of vertigo:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute vertigo due to a vertebrobasilar stroke is almost always accompanied by other evidence of brainstem ischemia such as diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, weakness, or numbness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, infarction of the cerebellum may present as vertigo with no other symptoms. Focal neck pain may suggest vertebral artery dissection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertigo in patients with multiple sclerosis may also be preceded by or associated with other neurologic dysfunction depending on the locus of demyelination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deafness and tinnitus suggest a peripheral lesion of the inner ear. A sensation of aural fullness typically accompanies attacks of Meniere disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meniere-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meniere disease&quot;</a>.) A pressure sensation in the ear and high frequency sensorineural hearing loss can be associated with the development of a traumatic perilymphatic fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache, photophobia, and sonophobia suggest migrainous vertigo.

Features most helpful in distinguishing central and peripheral vertigo are shown in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76359 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Nystagmus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nystagmus is a rhythmic oscillation of the eyes. There are many types of nystagmus. Some types of nystagmus suggest that a patient's complaint of vertigo originates from pathology in the vestibular system. </p><p>An important role of the vestibular system is to maintain gaze during head movement through the vestibular ocular reflexes. Acute unilateral vestibular lesions lead to a pathologic asymmetry in vestibular activity. This results in a slow drift of the eyes away from the target in one direction, followed by a fast corrective movement in the reverse direction. The eyes appear to &quot;beat&quot; in the direction of the fast phase. This nystagmus, which is often labeled &ldquo;spontaneous nystagmus&rdquo;, continues until the asymmetry of vestibular activity is restored to normal or until the central nervous system adapts to the vestibular lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nystagmus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a patient with acute vertigo, nystagmus is usually visible with the patient looking straight ahead. If the lesion is peripheral, the fast phase is away from the affected side. Usually, nystagmus increases in frequency and amplitude with gaze toward the side of the fast phase, eg, leftward gaze increases left-beating nystagmus, if present.</p><p>Other features of the nystagmus have localizing value for central versus peripheral vertigo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76359 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of nystagmus. A mixed horizontal-torsional nystagmus results if a peripheral lesion affects all three semicircular canals on one side. The horizontal fast phases beat toward the normal ear, as do the upper poles of the eyes for the torsional fast phases. The nystagmus from peripheral disease occasionally appears purely horizontal, but it is never purely torsional or vertical. The nystagmus with central lesions may have any trajectory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual fixation tends to suppress nystagmus that is due to a peripheral lesion, but it does not usually suppress nystagmus from a central lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It may be useful to inhibit visual fixation to test whether the nystagmus is central or peripheral in origin. Frenzel lenses are large magnifiers that blur vision and prevent visual fixation. A peripheral lesion is likely if nystagmus increases when Frenzel lenses are in place. The effect of fixation can also be determined during ophthalmoscopy if the examiner covers and uncovers the other eye. One group of investigators has proposed that examination with a penlight (substituting for the ophthalmoscope) may also allow examination for nystagmus with and without fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A peripheral disorder is likely if nystagmus increases on covering the fixating eye. In the ophthalmoscopic examination, the direction of nystagmus appears reversed, because the optic nerve head is behind the center of eye rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing nystagmus in different gaze positions can provide other localizing clues. In peripheral lesions, the predominant direction of nystagmus remains the same in all directions of gaze. Nystagmus that reverses direction when the patient looks right then left suggests a central abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the absence of this feature does not rule out a central cause of vertigo. Nystagmus that reverses direction with convergence also suggests a central lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Balance and gait</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to stand or walk unsupported and the direction of falling may provide useful clues to the origin of vertigo, although it may be difficult to persuade a patient with severe vertigo to attempt to walk.</p><p>Unilateral peripheral disorders generally cause patients to lean or fall toward the side of the lesion. Patients may be uncomfortable and reluctant to move because of their vertigo, but they are still able to walk. Romberg testing will cause the patients to fall or tilt to one side.</p><p>Patients with an acute cerebellar stroke are often unable to walk without falling. The direction of tilting or falling with Romberg testing may vary.</p><p>The sensitivity of balance testing may be increased by other variables such as eye-closing, standing on foam, and performing head movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Other neurologic signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A careful neurologic examination should be performed since the presence of additional neurologic abnormalities strongly suggests the presence of a central lesion. A search should be made for cranial nerve abnormalities, motor or sensory changes, dysmetria, or abnormal reflexes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.) In particular, the abnormal facial sensation, ptosis, and diplopia of a lateral medullary infarction may be overlooked by both patients and clinicians when the vertigo is profound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-etiology-and-differential-diagnosis-of-vertigo#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, etiology, and differential diagnosis of vertigo&quot;, section on 'Wallenberg syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-circulation-cerebrovascular-syndromes#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes&quot;, section on 'Lateral medullary infarction'</a>.)</p><p>However, the absence of other neurologic signs does not exclude a central process. In particular, a midline or inferior cerebellar infarction may produce no neurologic signs other than nystagmus and gait instability on examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Office hearing tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bedside tests of hearing and an examination of the tympanic membrane can be useful in distinguishing the etiology of vertigo. The otoscopic examination provides evidence of acute or chronic otitis media.</p><p>The examiner can easily test hearing by several methods. One is to softly whisper into each ear and then ask the patient to repeat what was whispered. Another is to hold the examiner's hands next to the patient's ears but out of the patient's eyesight. The examiner then rubs the fingers together on one side, with a sham rubbing movement on the opposite side, and asks the patient to report when the finger scratching sound is heard and from which ear it is heard. Another method is to vibrate a 512 Hz tuning fork, placing it close to one ear and then the other in rapid succession so that the patient can compare the loudness.</p><p>The Weber and Rinne tests are used to distinguish conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74212 \">table 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Weber test, a vibrating tuning fork is placed on the forehead in the midline. With normal hearing, the sound is heard equally in both ears. With sensorineural hearing loss, the sound localizes to the normal ear.

The tuning fork is placed on the mastoid bone behind the ear of the affected side in order to test bone conduction of sound. The vibrating tuning fork is then placed about 2.5 cm from the ear to test air conduction. Normally, air conduction of sound is better than bone conduction, and the sound is heard louder next to the ear than when placed on the mastoid. With conductive hearing loss, the tuning fork is heard less well or not at all when the tuning fork is adjacent to the ear. With sensorineural hearing loss, both air and bone conduction may be quantitatively decreased, but air conduction remains better than bone conduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58032 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74212 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p>Unilateral sensorineural hearing loss suggests a peripheral lesion; audiometry is required for confirmation.

These maneuvers are most useful in patients who do not have symptoms or nystagmus at rest. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver tests for canalithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal, which is the most common cause of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other maneuvers are used to provoke the nystagmus of less common variants of BPPV (anterior canal, horizontal canal). These are discussed separately.

The patient is then placed supine rapidly, so that the head hangs over the edge of the bed. The patient is kept in this position until 30 seconds have passed if no nystagmus occurs. The patient is then returned to upright, observed for another 30 seconds for nystagmus, and the maneuver is repeated with the head turned to the other side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52232\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52232 \">figure 2</a>). A video demonstrating this maneuver can be viewed at <a href=\"http://www.neurology.org/content/70/22/2067/suppl/DC2&amp;token=mfudhrLzJxQ3YoHmX3q9PF5vJtvBr9faqPD9HoOtZlvbd6cROsg5IV1Xi9nwkV8EOOKB45cUxD8ECfAV+Gnn4g==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5094\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.neurology.org/content/70/22/2067/suppl/DC2</a> (video 1). </p><p>The Dix-Hallpike maneuver will usually provoke paroxysmal vertigo and nystagmus if posterior canal dysfunction is present in the lower ear. The nystagmus and vertigo usually appear after a latency of a few seconds and last less than 30 seconds. It has a typical trajectory, beating upward and torsionally, with the upper poles of the eyes beating toward the ground. After the patient sits up, the nystagmus will recur but in the opposite direction. The maneuver should be repeated to the same side; with each repetition the intensity and duration of nystagmus will diminish, confirming the fatigable nature of the phenomenon. However, repetition of the maneuver can interfere with the ability to immediately perform a therapeutic particle repositioning maneuver; repetition may be deferred when this is being considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo&quot;, section on 'Particle repositioning maneuvers'</a>.)</p><p>The latency, transience, and fatigability, coupled with the typical mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">horizontal/rotatory</span> direction, are important in diagnosing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo due to posterior canalithiasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73213\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73213 \">table 5</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The abnormal response is that the eyes are dragged off of the target by the head turn (in one direction), followed by a saccade back to the target after the head turn; this response indicates a deficient vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) on the side of the head turn, implying a peripheral vestibular lesion (inner ear or vestibular nerve) on that side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/15,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,29</a>].

However, the use of caloric testing as the gold standard in these studies may not be appropriate and may underestimate sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In one report, flexing the head forward 30&ordm; during the test increased sensitivity to as high as 71 to 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The clinical and diagnostic utility of most of these signs is not known, as they have not been systematically studied against a gold standard.</p><p>These tests are often categorized as to those indicating static vestibular imbalance (spontaneous nystagmus, skew deviation, ocular tilt reaction, and tilt of the subjective visual vertical) and those indicating dynamic vestibular imbalance. The latter implies functional impairment of the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR), which acts to keep the line of sight steady during head movements. This can be detected clinically in four ways: head impulse test, head shaking visual acuity, post-head shaking nystagmus, and caloric tests.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skew deviation</strong> &mdash; A skew deviation is a vertical misalignment of the two eyes resulting from a supranuclear (relative to the ocular motor nuclei) pathology, usually located in the brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This may also be caused by a vestibular lesion because of imbalance in otolithic-ocular reflexes. The vertical separation can be tested by placing a red lens over one eye, shining a white point-light at the patient, and asking him or her to note the relative position of the red spot to the white spot. The light should be moved to see how the separation changes with lateral and vertical gaze. Skew deviation is often &quot;comitant,&quot; meaning that gaze direction has little effect upon the distance between the images. When it is incomitant, it needs to be differentiated from other problems such as cranial nerve IV nerve palsies.

SVV tilt can be measured at the bedside using a simple device made from a bucket with a straight line drawn on the bottom (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66460 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].<br/><br/>Skew deviation, OTR, and tilt of the SVV can occur with acute peripheral vestibular lesions or with acute central lesions involving the cerebellum or brainstem vestibular pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. Lesions of the peripheral vestibular system or medulla cause a skew deviation with the ipsilateral eye lower and extorted (ipsiversive), along with an ipsiversive tilt of SVV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Lesions of the midbrain cause the opposite (contraversive). Cerebellar lesions, which involve the dentate nucleus, also cause contraversive OTR, while those that spare the dentate nucleus can cause an ipsiversive OTR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/46,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,49</a>]. Patients with these manifestations may complain of vertical diplopia but may also experience a tilt illusion of their vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Head shaking visual acuity</strong> &mdash; Head shaking visual acuity is tested by having the patient look at an eye chart in the distance wearing his or her customary distance vision eyeglasses. Customary eyeglasses are important since the VOR is calibrated for a given rotational magnification that varies with different strengths of glasses. The patient reads the eye chart while his or her head is shaken continuously over a small range at about 2 Hz. Then, the patient reads the chart again while his or her head is still. Head shaking acuity that is more than four lines worse than the head still acuity indicates a poor VOR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Head shaking nystagmus</strong> &mdash; Head shaking nystagmus is elicited by the patient shaking the head from side to side for 15 to 40 seconds with eyes closed or Frenzel lenses in place. The shaking causes vigorous stimulation of the horizontal semicircular canals of both sides; their velocity data are stored in the cerebellum, decaying slowly after the head stops moving. When the shaking stops, the patient then opens his or her eyes and attempts to look straight ahead. If both sides were equally activated, the decay of velocity information will be balanced, and the eyes will be still. If there is unilateral labyrinthine damage, the asymmetrical neural output will generate a nystagmus that beats away from the damaged side. This test will be normal in patients with bilateral symmetric disease, unlike rapid head thrusts or caloric responses. The test is abnormal in patients with unilateral central vestibular lesions.<br/><br/>Using caloric testing as the gold standard, head shaking nystagmus has a sensitivity of 46 percent and a specificity of 75 percent for the detection of unilateral peripheral or central vestibular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In series of patients with vestibular neuritis, head shaking nystagmus was present in 95 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].<br/><br/>Head shaking nystagmus may also differentiate central and peripheral lesions. While the induced nystagmus is contralateral to the lesion in peripheral vestibulopathy, nystagmus produced by head shaking in patients with medullary lesions is ipsilateral to the lesion, even in cases in which the spontaneous nystagmus is contralateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Caloric testing</strong> &mdash; Caloric testing is performed by infusing warm or cold water into the ear. Otoscopy should be performed first to ensure that cerumen is not obstructing the flow of water to the tympanic membrane and to verify that there is no tympanic membrane perforation. The head of the patient should be tilted at 30&ordm; up from supine for optimal stimulation of the horizontal semicircular canals.<br/><br/>When warm water at 44&ordm;C is infused into an ear, the normal response is nystagmus with the fast component toward the infused ear. The opposite response occurs when cold water at 30&ordm;C is infused; the normal response is nystagmus with the fast component away from the cold water-infused ear. <br/><br/>Lack of a response to warm or cold water on one side suggests disease on that side, usually in peripheral lesions. Central vestibular disorders may also cause caloric hyposensitivity, especially if they involve the vestibular root entry in the medulla. This test can cause significant distress, including nausea and vomiting in awake patients; it is rarely performed in the office evaluation of vertigo but may be useful in the vestibular laboratory (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Electronystagmography and video nystagmography'</a> below). Caloric testing is also used in the evaluation of coma.

The indications for this more specialized testing (as well as indications for specialist referral) are not precise. The relatively low prevalence of serious disorders should be balanced against their prognostic and treatment implications when deciding whether to order these tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Brain imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is indicated in selected patients when the history and examination suggest either a central cause of vertigo or a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76359\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76359 \">table 3</a>).

While the latter has a benign course, the former can be acutely life threatening. A younger patient with acute sustained vertigo, with no other neurologic signs or symptoms, and with nystagmus and an examination that is consistent with a peripheral origin (suppression with visual fixation, falling in opposite direction to nystagmus, <span class=\"nowrap\">horizontal/torsional</span> nystagmus) does not need immediate imaging if there is improvement within 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, neuroimaging is indicated if the examination is not entirely consistent with a peripheral lesion, if there are prominent risk factors for stroke, if there are neurologic signs or symptoms, or if there is a new headache accompanying the vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/14,23,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23,57</a>].</p><p>The procedure of choice is MRI and MR angiography (MRA).

The scan is usually normal in the first hours after an infarct and is overall a less sensitive test than MRI for early infarcts and small mass lesions. However, intraparenchymal hemorrhage will usually be evident immediately. A brain CT scan should therefore be performed if the clinical picture is compatible with cerebellar hemorrhage and the MRI scan is not immediately available. In one emergency room-based study, the diagnostic yield of head CT was low compared to MRI (2 versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Electronystagmography and video nystagmography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electronystagmography (ENG) uses electrodes to record eye movements.

Nevertheless, the audiogram is sensitive enough to detect unilateral hearing loss in almost all cases of vestibular schwannoma, and may be a useful screening test for this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].

Clinicians use the presence of cerebrovascular risk factors and associated neurologic deficits to determine the relative probability of a cerebrovascular etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The HINTS examination, in particular the head impulse test, can also be particularly useful in this setting to distinguish a peripheral cause of vertigo (eg, vestibular neuritis) from a central, cerebrovascular cause. In a young patient without cerebrovascular risk factors in whom a normal head impulse test suggests a localization within the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis might be more likely. However, the utility of the head impulse test or the HINTS examination has not been specifically studied in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H19188844\" class=\"local\">'Head impulse test'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Other vestibular signs'</a> above.). <br/><br/>An MRI should be performed when a cerebrovascular etiology is suspected. This is discussed in detail separately.

The Dix-Hallpike maneuver can help confirm this diagnosis.

As examples, associated headache suggests migrainous vertigo; hearing loss, tinnitus, ear fullness suggest Meniere disease; and other brainstem neurologic deficits suggest vertebrobasilar transient ischemia. The diagnosis of these conditions are discussed separately.

The presence of nystagmus helps confirm that the patient&rsquo;s complaint is vertigo, rather than an alternative form of dizziness. Its absence does not rule out vertigo.
