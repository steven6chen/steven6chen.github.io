Pregnancy-related changes in motility are present throughout the gastrointestinal tract and are related to increased levels of progesterone. In addition, the enlarging uterus displaces bowel, which can affect the presentation of disorders such as appendicitis. Knowledge of the gastrointestinal adaptation to pregnancy is necessary for accurate interpretation of laboratory tests as well as imaging studies in the gravid patient.</p><p>This topic will review maternal gastrointestinal tract changes during pregnancy and common gastrointestinal disorders related to pregnancy.

Gingival inflammatory symptoms are frequently aggravated during pregnancy; prevalence rates of 40 to 100 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The cause of pregnancy-induced gingivitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82278\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82278 \">picture 1</a>) is likely multifactorial and includes pregnancy hormone-related vascular and inflammatory changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].</p><p>Optimal oral hygiene can reduce gingival swelling, erythema, and bleeding tendencies; therefore, frequent brushing and flossing are important. Women with moderate to severe symptoms should consult with a dental professional.

It is a small, soft, pink or red, smooth or lobulated, exophytic growth on a pedunculated or sessile base that develops over a few days to weeks and bleeds easily due to its vascularity. It is thought to arise in response to local <span class=\"nowrap\">irritation/trauma</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hormonal factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Spontaneous resolution usually occurs postpartum so no intervention is typically performed for small lesions. Larger lesions can require excision.

Symptoms generally abate in the second trimester, although they can continue to term. Salivary volumes range from 1.5 L to 2 L per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The mechanism in pregnancy is not known, and ptyalism is commonly associated with nausea and vomiting as well as hyperemesis gravidarum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

For women with a potential identified cause, treatment or removal of the underlying cause reduces excessive salivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/14,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,18</a>]. For women with symptoms resulting only from pregnancy, treatment is mainly aimed at lessening symptoms. Women have reported relief with frequent expectoration, chewing gum or using lozenges, frequent drinks of water, and antiemetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>&quot;Pseudo&quot;-sialorrhea is caused by failure to swallow saliva that is being secreted at a normal rate.

Gastric emptying is not affected by pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. During labor, however, gastric emptying is prolonged if sedative or opiate drugs are administered. A combination of factors related to pregnancy, supine position, and analgesia and anesthesia put pregnant women at high risk of aspiration during labor and delivery.</p><p>In contrast to the stomach, transit time is prolonged in the small and large intestine. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Bloating and constipation'</a> below.)</p><p>Women with diabetes may have gastroparesis.

Most studies report an increasing prevalence of symptoms from the first to the third trimester, with relief postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Gastroesophageal reflux tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies, and similarly affects multiparous and nulliparous women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux during pregnancy involves both mechanical and intrinsic factors that adversely affect lower esophageal sphincter tone. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure is below the lower limits of normal in all trimesters, returning to normal in the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. A study of women during early pregnancy and six weeks after pregnancy termination also demonstrated an inappropriate response of the sphincter to injections with pentagastrin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, or a protein meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, it appears that pregnancy is associated with both decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure and inhibition of the adaptive responses of the sphincter.</p><p>Animal and human experiments have helped elucidate the effects of female sex hormones on the lower esophageal sphincter. In vivo models (using the opossum) showed a substantial reduction of lower esophageal tone with the administration of both estradiol and progesterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Whether the decrease in tone was due to estrogen, progesterone, or both is unclear. Some studies suggest that progesterone is the mediator of lower esophageal sphincter muscle relaxation; however, estrogen is likely needed as a primer because estrogen induces the progesterone receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>When present, GERD typically lasts throughout pregnancy and resolves postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. While symptoms can be severe, erosive gastritis and other complications are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

They are at highest risk of occurrence during labor or soon after delivery, presumably as a consequence of sedation and assumption of a recumbent position. Aspiration may also occur as a complication of general anesthesia and intubation for an emergent cesarean delivery. Aspiration pneumonia, acute bronchospasm, or the acute respiratory distress syndrome may ensue. Ideally pregnant women should be fasting for up to eight hours prior to a scheduled <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elective surgical procedure.

The enlarging uterus causes a progressive upward displacement of the diaphragm, to a maximum of 4 cm, and the liver is forced up further into the chest as well. A palpable liver is an abnormal finding. On ultrasound examination, the biliary tract is usually normal. Because of hemodilution, serum albumin levels decrease during the first trimester, and this decrement becomes more accentuated with advancing gestation.</p><p>Multiple blood chemicals change as a result of pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114668\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114668 \">table 2</a>). Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations increase markedly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Reported ranges vary among studies. In one large series, the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the distributions in the second and the third trimesters were total triglyceride 254 and 415 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.87 and 4.68 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> respectively; total cholesterol 319 and 380 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.24 and 9.83 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> respectively; LDL-cholesterol 217 and 251 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.61 and 6.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> respectively; and the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of HDL-cholesterol distribution was 42 and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.09 and 1.04 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As these lipid changes with pregnancy are physiologic, treatment is not indicated. Women who are receiving statin therapy for hypercholesterolemia that predates pregnancy ideally should stop statin treatment three months prior to conception.

Serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is significantly reduced and 5'-nucleotidase is slightly increased. The other liver biochemical tests are either normal or slightly increased or decreased, but remain within the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, an increase in serum aminotransferase, bilirubin, or fasting total bile acid concentrations during pregnancy may be pathologic and should prompt further evaluation. The prothrombin time is unchanged during pregnancy, and serum fibrinogen increases in late pregnancy.</p><p>Additional issues regarding the effect of pregnancy on the liver are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-liver-disease-occurring-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to liver disease occurring during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intercurrent hepatobiliary disease during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrahepatic-cholestasis-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-pre-existing-chronic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with pre-existing chronic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-fatty-liver-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute fatty liver of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">GALLBLADDER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy decreases gallbladder motility and increases the lithogenicity of bile.

Prospective longitudinal studies of pregnant women using Rome II criteria to define constipation reported the prevalence of constipation ranged from 16 to 39 percent in each trimester of pregnancy and 6 to 12 weeks postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. This is higher than the baseline rate of constipation (7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]) in nonpregnant women of similar age.</p><p>Abdominal bloating and constipation during pregnancy are likely caused by hormonal changes that affect small bowel and colonic motility. Increased progesterone concentration plays the major role in decreasing the activity of colonic smooth muscle, but other hormones may be involved. Animal and human studies evaluating gastrointestinal transit during pregnancy, and in relation to hormonal changes during the estrus cycle, support this concept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. For example, a study that measured gastrointestinal transit time and sex hormone concentrations in 15 women during their third trimester of pregnancy and four to six weeks postpartum found that small bowel transit time was significantly longer during pregnancy when progesterone and estradiol levels were increased compared to the postpartum period when the hormonal levels had fallen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Another study noted that intestinal transit times were prolonged in both the second and third trimesters of pregnancy compared to the first trimester or the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A third study showed that progesterone inhibited both the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous colon muscle activity, while estrogen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> had no effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>However, other factors may also contribute to the prolongation in transit time. The plasma concentration of motilin (a stimulatory gastrointestinal hormone) is reduced during pregnancy, possibly because progesterone may inhibit motilin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In addition, the gravid uterus can cause mechanical impedance to small bowel transit, particularly late in gestation. Pregnant women also become constipated for the same reasons as the general population; in addition, pregnancy-related factors, such as bed-rest and iron supplements, can promote constipation.

Conditions such as gallstone pancreatitis, appendicitis, cholelithiasis with cholecystitis, and acute hepatitis require urgent consultation from a GI expert. Additionally refractory nausea with vomiting and persistent inability to tolerate oral intake resulting in malnutrition may require non-urgent consultation from a GI specialist with expertise regarding intravenous hyperalimentation or total parental nutrition. Severe dyspepsia that does not resolve with medical therapy may require upper endoscopy, which can be performed safely by a gastroenterologist and is not contraindicated during pregnancy. Ongoing rectal bleeding in the absence of hemorrhoids or pre-existing irritable bowel disease warrants a non-urgent referral to a GI specialist and colonoscopy may be warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Oropharynx'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal reflux is common in pregnancy because of decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure and inhibition of the adaptive responses of the sphincter. Most studies report an increasing prevalence of symptoms from the first to the third trimester, with relief postpartum. Gastroesophageal reflux tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies, and similarly affects multiparous and nulliparous women. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gastroesophageal reflux'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women are predisposed to gastric aspiration due to increased intraabdominal pressure and relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. They are at highest risk of occurrence during labor or soon after delivery, presumably as a consequence of sedation and assumption of a recumbent position. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Aspiration of gastric contents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum aminotransferase, bilirubin, and fasting total bile acid concentrations remain within the normal range during pregnancy. Serum albumin and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels are significantly reduced, whereas lipids and alkaline phosphatase levels are significantly increased. Treatment of elevated lipid levels is not indicated during pregnancy and women who are receiving statin therapy for hypercholesterolemia that predates pregnancy ideally should stop statin treatment three months prior to conception. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Liver'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallbladder volume and the lithogenicity of bile are increased. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Gallbladder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amylase levels appear to remain in the normal range or be slightly elevated. Acute pancreatitis during pregnancy is rare. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pancreas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal bloating and constipation during pregnancy are likely caused by hormonal changes (increased progesterone concentration) that reduce small bowel and colonic motility, in addition to the bowel compression caused by the growing uterus. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Bloating and constipation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fecal incontinence and flatus are more common during pregnancy.
