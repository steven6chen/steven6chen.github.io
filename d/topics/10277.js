DM, unlike PM, is characterized by the presence of various cutaneous manifestations. DM and PM may also be associated with inflammatory arthritis, interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, and the presence of autoantibodies.</p><p>An association between inflammatory myopathy and cancer has been recognized since the report of two cases of PM and gastric cancer in 1916 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The association is stronger for patients with DM than PM. The evidence for an association between cancer and inflammatory myopathy includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic evidence from large population studies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporal relationship between the diagnosis of cancer and myopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The improvement or resolution of myopathy after treatment of the cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapse or development of myopathy associated with relapse of the cancer</p><p/><p>The increased frequency of cancer in patients with inflammatory myopathy is consistent with the concept that paraneoplastic processes linked to oncogenesis and autoimmunity contribute to the disease in a subset of DM and PM cases.</p><p>Issues related to malignancy in patients with DM and PM will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of both the adult and juvenile forms of these disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-treatment-complications-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Treatment, complications, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise links between malignancy and inflammatory myopathy remain incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, the temporal relationship in some patients between the development of cancer and diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy is reminiscent of that seen in neurologic paraneoplastic disorders in which the antigens targeted for an immune response are expressed at high levels in both the inciting tumor and the affected neuronal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regenerating cells in myositis muscle but not in normal muscle express high levels of myositis-specific autoantigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These same antigens are expressed at high levels in several cancers known to be associated with the development of inflammatory myopathy, but not in corresponding normal tissue. These observations suggest that the link between malignancy and inflammatory myopathy relates to the expression of common autoantigens between cancer tissue and muscle tissue in some patients with dermatomyositis (DM) or polymyositis (PM), and that the immune response directed at tumor cells may also target similar autoantigens in muscle tissue resulting in muscle damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association between malignancy and inflammatory myopathy has been supported by numerous epidemiologic studies, with the strongest association occurring in those with dermatomyositis (DM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/6-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86590943\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review of 258 cases of DM and cancer reported in the literature from 1916 through the mid-1970s estimated that the incidence of cancer for patients with DM was increased five- to seven-fold compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The increased risk has subsequently been confirmed in population-based studies from a variety of countries. Standardized incidence ratios from population-based studies from Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] range from approximately 3.0 to 6.0. The largest population study from Taiwan included 1,012 DM and 643 polymyositis (PM) patients from the National Health Insurance Database from 1997-2007. Among the DM patients, the frequency of cancer was 9.4 percent and the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 5.11 (95% CI 5.01-5.22). In the PM group, the frequency of cancer was 4.4 percent with an SIR of 2.15 (95% CI 2.08-2.22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The cancer rates reported with PM are consistently lower than that of DM. Some investigators have questioned whether the modestly increased incidence in PM indicates a true increase in cancer risk or may reflect increased surveillance in PM patients compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86590009\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of malignancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenocarcinomas of the cervix, lung, ovaries, pancreas, bladder, and stomach account for approximately 70 percent of the cancers associated with inflammatory myopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/6,8,12,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,12,15-17</a>].

In some populations, the types of malignancy associated with DM or PM reflect cancers found in particularly high prevalence within that population. As an example, Southeast Asian patients with DM are at increased risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporal relationship</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer can be diagnosed before, simultaneously with, or after the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The peak incidence of a cancer diagnosis in DM and PM occurs simultaneously with and during the first year after the diagnosis of the muscle disease, and falls off gradually over the subsequent five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/8,11,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,18,19</a>], although there may still be some increased risk beyond five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-in-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis/abstract/11,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19</a>].</p><p>In some patients, the inflammatory myopathy is diagnosed at the time of recurrence of previously diagnosed cancer.
