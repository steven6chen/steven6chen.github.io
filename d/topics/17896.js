The management of women with primary dysmenorrhea will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary dysmenorrhea in adult women: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OVERVIEW</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28816153\"><span class=\"h2\">Goal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of treatment is to provide adequate relief of pain. At a minimum, pain relief should be sufficient to allow the woman to perform most, if not all, of her usual activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28816178\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea can be initiated empirically. Laboratory tests, imaging studies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laparoscopy are not required to definitively exclude causes of secondary dysmenorrhea when a detailed history and physical examination strongly support the diagnosis. Relief of symptoms with standard treatments, as reviewed below, further supports the diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea. If symptoms do not sufficiently respond to standard treatments, we begin an evaluation for causes of secondary dysmenorrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary dysmenorrhea in adult women: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H52181508\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary dysmenorrhea in adult women: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>General measures for management include patient education and reassurance. Treatment is supportive and should be guided by individual needs, as the severity of pain and degree of limitation of activity vary widely among women with dysmenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65347 \">table 1</a>). The initial approach includes a discussion of nonpharmacologic interventions that can be helpful, such as application of a heat pack to the lower abdomen, exercise, and relaxation techniques. First-line pharmacologic therapy includes nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> estrogen-progestin contraceptives (cyclic, long-cycle, or continuous), depending on the clinical needs of the patient. For women with primary dysmenorrhea desiring contraception, estrogen-progestin contraceptives are a logical choice. For women who prefer not to use hormonal treatment, NSAIDs are a logical choice. However, some women may need both types of treatment. Patient specific factors, such as personal treatment goals and the cost and convenience of various treatments, help guide treatment selection. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>Women who do not achieve adequate pain relief after three months of treatment with NSAIDs and hormonal contraceptives may have secondary dysmenorrhea due to endometriosis or other conditions. Clinical factors suggesting that a diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea is not accurate includes persistent symptoms resistant to standard treatment, missing work or school, and multiple visits to the emergency department for pain with menses. Treatment options for these women can range from empiric GnRH agonist or progestin therapy to diagnostic laparoscopy. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices can help some women. Further discussion of treatment options are presented below and discussions of the evaluation and treatment of endometriosis are presented separately. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Management of treatment failure'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Surgical management of pelvic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SELF-CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is reasonable to discuss self-care approaches to pain relief, especially for women who want to avoid drug therapy. Heat therapy is the most effective of these approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Heat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In randomized trials, application of heat to the lower abdomen was effective for relief of dysmenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Heat was as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most women find applying heat more cumbersome than taking oral medications, but it has no side effects. Heat therapy may improve the efficacy of other treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial randomly assigned 84 women to receive a heated patch plus placebo tablet, an unheated patch plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> (400 mg), a heated patch plus ibuprofen, or an unheated patch and placebo tablet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Women assigned a heated abdominal patch or ibuprofen achieved comparable pain relief and significantly greater pain relief than those assigned an unheated patch and placebo tablet. The combination of a heated abdominal patch plus ibuprofen did not provide greater total pain relief than an unheated abdominal patch plus ibuprofen. However, the combination of a heated abdominal patch plus ibuprofen reduced the time to noticeable pain relief compared to an unheated abdominal patch plus ibuprofen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial by the same group randomly assigned 367 women with dysmenorrhea to an abdominal heat wrap (40 degrees Celsius) which was worn for eight hours, a placebo wrap, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> (1000 mg every five hours, four times per day for one day), or placebo pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The heat wrap provided better pain relief than acetaminophen and was well tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A different trial of 115 women with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea reported that women treated with a device that combined heat and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation reported significantly lower dysmenorrhea scores compared with controls using a sham device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These devices are available in the United States, though they are generally not labeled for dysmenorrhea treatments. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H832071\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise and sexual activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic review on the use of exercise for relief of dysmenorrhea included a single randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] that provided evidence that exercise reduces menstrual symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most observational studies have reported decreased prevalence of dysmenorrhea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> improved symptomatology with exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the quality of this trial and these studies was low. As there are multiple health benefits to exercise, increasing physical activity is a reasonable approach, especially for sedentary women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Yoga [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] and sexual activity may be helpful. Anecdotal experience suggests menses-related discomfort is relieved by orgasm in some women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H832078\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral interventions include attempts at modification of the way the patient thinks about her pain (eg, desensitization based procedures, hypnotherapy, imagery, coping strategies) and attempts at modification of her response to pain (eg, biofeedback, electromyographic training, Lamaze exercises, relaxation training). There is no high quality evidence to support or refute use of these modalities; a systematic review of randomized trials concluded some women may be helped by them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet and vitamins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of dietary changes and vitamin therapies has been reported to reduce the severity of menstrual pain, but data are limited to a few small studies. Although the limited available data appear promising, we would like to see confirmatory data from additional trials before suggesting these interventions for our patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one clinical trial, 33 women with primary dysmenorrhea and premenstrual symptoms were randomly assigned, in a crossover design, to receive a <strong>low fat-vegetarian diet</strong> for two months or a placebo dietary supplement pill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While on the vegetarian diet, the women noted a statistically significant decrease in menstrual pain intensity and duration, and they had a mean weight loss of 1.8 kg. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A self-report study of dietary <strong>dairy intake</strong> in 127 female university students indicated that women who consumed three or four servings of dairy products per day had lower rates of dysmenorrhea than women who consumed no dairy products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two randomized trials reported that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> alone (500 units per day or 200 units twice per day, beginning two days before menses and continuing through the first three days of bleeding) was more effective than placebo for relieving dysmenorrhea in adolescents randomly assigned to either therapy, although both active drug and placebo reduced pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic review including mostly single small trials, <strong>vitamin B1</strong> (100 mg daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a> (200 mg daily), and <strong>fish oil supplement</strong> (1080 mg eicosapentaenoic acid, 720 mg docosahexaenoic acid, and 1.5 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>) were each more effective for reducing pain than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial of 40 women with dysmenorrhea and a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level &lt;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> found that a single large dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d3-cholecalciferol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin D3</a> (oral, 300,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/1</span> mL) given five days prior to the expected first day of the menstrual cycle resulted in a statistically significant decrease in pain scores compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, this trial had several major limitations. The serum vitamin D level used was higher than the usual threshold for vitamin D supplementation (&lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. In addition, the safety of the administration of a large dose of vitamin D is uncertain; a large randomized trial found that administration of 500,000 IU resulted in more fractures than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Given these limitations, additional studies are needed before this therapy is used clinically. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of three trials totaling 170 women that compared the efficacy of <strong>ginger</strong> with placebo for reducing dysmenorrhea, consumption of 750 to 2000 mg of ginger powder on days 1 to 3 of the menstrual cycle was associated with a mean 2-point reduction in 10-point pain visual analogue scores for women receiving ginger compared with placebo treatment (mean difference -2.3, 95% CI -3.5 to -1.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Limitations of this analysis include small total sample size and lack of information on how the ginger powder was prepared for consumption. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best evidence for achieving pain relief of primary dysmenorrhea is based on randomized trials of drug therapies. A placebo effect is particularly strong in primary dysmenorrhea trials, especially in the first month of treatment. However, the effects of placebo treatment appear to fade quickly. This was illustrated in a study in which placebo therapy was associated with self-reported improvement in symptoms in the first, second, third, and fourth months of treatment in 84, 29, 16, and 10 percent of women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. By comparison, active treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) produced an 80 to 86 percent response rate that was maintained throughout the four months of treatment. These results underscore that, optimally, treatment of primary dysmenorrhea is informed by prospective, double-blind trials in which treatment is administered over several cycles.</p><p>NSAIDs and hormonal contraceptives represent the mainstays of drug therapy. No randomized trials have compared the efficacy of NSAIDs versus hormonal contraception for treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. If treatment with one of these agents fails after two or three months, we suggest a course of treatment with the other. Treatment with both hormonal contraception and NSAIDs may be effective in women who remain symptomatic on either drug alone. In addition, reevaluation of the original diagnosis is always indicated when therapies do not result in the anticipated level of response (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Management of treatment failure'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence from randomized trials has consistently demonstrated that NSAIDs effectively treat primary dysmenorrhea. In a systematic review of 73 randomized trials, NSAIDs were significantly more effective than placebo (OR 4.50, 95% CI 3.85-5.27) or paracetamol (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.05-3.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]</p><p>It is unclear whether specific NSAIDS are more effective or safer than others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although some studies have not observed differences in efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], others suggest that differences exist and that fenamates (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefenamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefenamic acid</a>, tolfenamic acid, flufenamic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meclofenamate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meclofenamate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromfenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromfenac</a>) may have slightly better efficacy than the phenylproprionic acid derivatives (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Both fenamates and phenylproprionic acid derivatives inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, but fenamates also block prostaglandin action, which may account for their enhanced effectiveness in some studies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot;</a>). </p><p>There are insufficient data on which to base a recommendation for one class of agents or the other. One approach to treatment is to start with a phenylproprionic acid derivative prescribed at the upper end of the dose range. The doses of several NSAIDs are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71912 \">table 2</a>). We prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 400 to 600 mg every four to six hours or 800 mg every eight hours to a maximum dose of 2400 mg per day, starting with the onset of symptoms or menses, and continue this dose for two or three days based on the patient's usual symptom pattern. An advantage of this approach is that phenylproprionic acid derivatives are relatively inexpensive, available without prescription, and of proven efficacy. </p><p>If the phenylpropionic acid derivative does not produce sufficient improvement in pain symptoms, then a fenamate can be used (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefenamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefenamic acid</a> 500 mg initially followed by 250 mg every six hours, with treatment typically limited to three days). Since NSAIDs are given for only a few days to young, generally healthy women, adverse effects tend to be less frequent than in other patient populations. General considerations regarding therapeutic use, drug interactions, and toxicities of NSAIDS are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-therapeutic-use-and-variability-of-response-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some COX-2 inhibitors have been approved for treatment of moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea. These drugs are more expensive than nonspecific NSAIDS, but may be useful in women who are at high risk for NSAID-related gastroduodenal toxicity. However, most of these agents have either been withdrawn from the market or issued with black box warnings regarding the risk of serious adverse events. Given these risks and the availability of safe and effective alternatives (nonspecific NSAIDs, as discussed above), we do not use COX-2 inhibitors for treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-selective-cox-2-inhibitors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of selective COX-2 inhibitors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30993152\"><span class=\"h3\">Negative effect on ovulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because prostaglandins play an important role in ovulation, NSAIDs, particularly COX-2 inhibitors, can prevent or delay this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. In fact, the negative effect of COX-2 inhibitors on ovulation is the basis of studies of these agents as potential emergency contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Clinical studies examining the effects of various NSAIDs in normally cycling subjects have demonstrated mixed effects on ovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-35</a>]. </p><p>Women taking NSAIDs and attempting to conceive can generally be reassured because these agents are only used at the time of menstruation. However, if a woman experiences difficulty conceiving, we suggest avoiding these drugs or reducing the dose, if possible, though the effect of such reduction is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unless contraindications are present, we suggest an estrogen-progestin hormonal contraceptive as first line treatment of women with dysmenorrhea who also need contraception. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15853619\"><span class=\"h3\">Estrogen-progestin methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estrogen-progestin contraceptives contain potent synthetic progestins, which suppress ovulation and cause the endometrium to become thin over time. The thin endometrium contains relatively small amounts of arachidonic acid, the substrate for most prostaglandin synthesis. As a result of these changes in the endometrium, estrogen-progestin contraceptives reduce both uterine bleeding flow and uterine contractions occurring during flow, thereby decreasing dysmenorrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15854052\"><span class=\"h4\">Pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic review of randomized trials of estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills for treatment of primary dysmenorrhea reported a significant benefit of treatment (pooled OR of 2.99, 95% CI 1.76-5.07) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Few trials compared different doses of estrogen and different progestins for treatment of primary dysmenorrhea; the review concluded pain relief was similar for low (&le;35 mcg) and medium (&gt;35 mcg) estrogen doses and there was no clear difference in efficacy among the different pill preparations. Even ultra-low-dose oral contraceptives can be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], reducing hormone load in those where this might be a benefit.</p><p>Limitations of these data were the small number of comparative trials, the small number of patients in these trials, and the lack of trials evaluating very low estrogen doses (20 mcg) found in modern pills or a wider variety of progestins. However, additional data from observational studies and other randomized trials have demonstrated efficacy of oral contraceptives formulated with 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol for treatment of dysmenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. Taken together, these findings suggest that any combination oral contraceptive pill is likely to be effective. </p><p>Oral contraceptive pills can be given in monthly or extended cycles, or continuously. In randomized trials, extended or continuous administration provided better relief of menstrual symptoms than cyclic administration, but all regimens appeared effective for symptom relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

The prevalence of occult pelvic pathology is high in these women. For example, endometriosis is diagnosed in 12 to 32 percent of women of reproductive age undergoing laparoscopy to determine the cause of pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In another study of 100 women with pelvic pain and clinically suspected endometriosis who did not have adequate pain relief with NSAIDs (some also treated with oral contraceptives) after six months, approximately 80 percent were documented to have endometriosis at laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>Given the high likelihood of a pelvic disease being present, we suggest diagnostic laparoscopy for women with dysmenorrhea who have not had adequate relief after three months of NSAIDs and hormonal contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. However, the role and timing of laparoscopy should depend on patient and clinician preference. If the woman has used estrogen-progestin contraceptives for three standard cycles without adequate relief, it is reasonable to try alternative hormonal approaches, including continuous estrogen-progestin contraceptives or a long-acting progestin-only method (see <a href=\"#H15853989\" class=\"local\">'Progestin-only methods'</a> above). Although each of these strategies can be effective in treating pain following surgery for endometriosis, there are little data regarding their use in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. Another option is to make a presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis and offer these women treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist analogue, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafarelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafarelin</a> (200 mcg intranasal spray twice per day) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a> acetate depot (3.75 mg intramuscularly every four weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

Even in the hands of experienced laparoscopists, an accurate diagnosis of endometriosis can be difficult since the disease is often microscopic and presents visually with a variety of atypical lesions. Alternatively, and if not already tried, continuous estrogen-progestin contraception, the LNG-IUD or DMPA can be used in this setting.
