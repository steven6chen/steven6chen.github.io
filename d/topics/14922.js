Hernia recurrence is less common with repair of inguinal compared with femoral hernia repair due to the higher rates of emergency surgery and complications associated with femoral hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>The indications for recurrent inguinal and femoral hernia repair are similar to those of primary inguinal and femoral hernia repair. Most symptomatic patients should undergo repair; however, some minimally symptomatic male patients can be safely observed. The choice of technique for repair of recurrent inguinal hernia is largely anatomically based, depending upon the nature of the prior hernia repair. In general, failed posterior repairs (eg, laparoscopic) should be repaired using an anterior approach, and vice versa, failed anterior repairs (eg, Lichtenstein repair) should be repaired using a posterior approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Repair of recurrent inguinal hernias can be more complicated than primary inguinal hernia repair and is associated with higher rates of recurrence (ie, re-recurrence) and other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>Recurrent inguinal hernia will be reviewed here.

A primary etiology for hernia is related to congenital tissue abnormalities, whereas a secondary hernia etiology is related to acquired tissue abnormalities (eg, trauma).

An older term, secondary hernia repair, is out of favor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Re-recurrent hernia &ndash; Re-recurrence refers to the occurrence of a hernia that has been repaired at least once before. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neglected hernia &ndash; We will use the term neglected hernia to refer to a hernia that was not identified prior to or during the course of repair of another hernia (primary, recurrent, or re-recurrent hernia repair) and thus was not repaired. These hernias do not technically represent a recurrence; however, they contribute to hernia repair outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12661512\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic site of recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic site of recurrence after inguinal hernia repair can be located anatomically at a direct (medial to the inferior epigastric vessels within Hesselbach's triangle), indirect (lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels), or femoral site (inferior to the inguinal ligament) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70359 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73484\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73484 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p>Following open inguinal hernia repair (mesh or non-mesh), the most common anatomic recurrence site is a direct hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Following Lichtenstein repair, a higher-than-expected rate of femoral recurrence has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In a study of 34,849 groin hernia repairs, a 15-fold greater incidence relative to the spontaneous incidence of femoral hernia was reported after inguinal herniorrhaphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These femoral recurrences tended to occur earlier than inguinal site recurrences, leading the authors to speculate these were neglected femoral hernias that were not treated at the time of primary repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, an indirect recurrence site is the most common anatomic site regardless of whether the initial repair was performed as a totally extraperitoneal hernia repair (TEP) or transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50283\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50283 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The mechanism is unclear but may be related to inadequate dissection of the spermatic cord or, alternatively, herniation of the sac beneath the mesh due to mesh migration, inadequate mesh size, inadequate mesh fixation, or subsequent mesh shrinkage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic inguinal and femoral hernia repair in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3062231\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS FOR RECURRENT INGUINAL HERNIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of recurrence for inguinal hernia may be declining due to the more frequent use of mesh in primary hernia repairs. In a retrospective review from Olmsted County, Minnesota, the incidence of recurrent inguinal hernia decreased from <span class=\"nowrap\">66/100,000</span> person-years to <span class=\"nowrap\">26/100,000</span> person-years from 1989 to 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Risk factors for recurrent hernia can be related to the type of prior hernia and technical aspects of that repair, complications of repair such as infection, as well as patient- and surgeon-related factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/2,4,12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,12,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2972726\"><span class=\"h2\">Technical issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main technical factors associated with recurrent inguinal hernia include hernia repair under tension, most commonly due to non-mesh repair (ie, herniorrhaphy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/4,12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,18</a>] or inadequate mesh size or potentially inadequate mesh fixation (open or laparoscopic). Excessive dissection and devascularization can also lead to hernia recurrence. Not surprisingly, the recurrence rate is higher for repair of recurrent hernias (ie, re-recurrence) compared with repair of primary hernias related to increased complexity of recurrent hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/9,12,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12661688\" class=\"local\">'Re-recurrent hernia'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2972765\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-mesh hernia repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-mesh repair, which is less likely to produce a tension-free repair, is an important cause of failed hernia repair. Provided mesh is used, no significant differences have been identified in the incidence of recurrent hernia following primary hernia repair, regardless of operative approach (ie, open versus laparoscopic hernia repair) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/2,4,5,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5,20,21</a>].

In a review of 32,206 hernias from the Swedish Hernia Registry and the Danish Hernia Database, the overall recurrence rate was 0.7 percent for Lichtenstein repair, which is an open, mesh repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82223\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82223 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Most recurrences, which were direct hernias located at the pubic tubercle or along the medial edge of the repair, were technical failures attributed to inadequate mesh fixation and inadequate mesh overlap at the pubic tubercle. In one retrospective review of 1983 men undergoing laparoscopic or open (Lichtenstein) repair for primary or recurrent inguinal hernia, the higher recurrence rate for laparoscopic repair was attributed to a smaller size of mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

As an example, in a study of 498 patients undergoing total extraperitoneal (TEP) laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs, 27 percent were found to have a cord lipoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Obese patients and those who have a large hernial defect are at a higher risk. </p><p>Cord lipomas encountered in the inguinal canal during open hernia repair should be resected. During laparoscopic (TEP) surgery, cord lipomas in the inguinal canal or the internal ring should either be resected or reduced to the pelvic peritoneal reflection line, followed by the placement of a mesh that separates the reduced lipomas and the internal ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Failure to recognize and manage a cord lipoma could result in recurrent hernia formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. By one estimate, missed cord lipomas accounted for 30 to 50 percent of recurrent inguinal hernias following laparoscopic repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2972777\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open mesh repairs can be performed using local, regional, or neuraxial anesthesia, whereas laparoscopic repairs usually require general anesthesia. Whether or not the type of anesthesia used at the time of hernia repair impacts the risk for recurrent inguinal hernia is controversial. </p><p>An increased risk for recurrent hernia was reported in the past for hernia repair using local anesthesia compared with general or regional anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A later multivariate analysis using data from 59,823 hernia repairs from the Swedish Hernia Registry found an overall increased risk for recurrence when the repair was performed using local anesthesia compared with a regional or general anesthesia, a difference that was apparent for primary inguinal hernia repair but not for recurrent inguinal hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a review of the Danish Hernia Database (43,123 hernia repairs), there were no overall differences in the hernia recurrence rate (3.5 percent) based upon the type of anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Although hernia recurrence was more common using a local anesthetic for direct (medial) versus indirect (lateral) hernia repair (7 versus 2 percent), this difference was attributed to the location of healthcare delivery. The rate of hernia recurrence was much lower at private hospitals, where local anesthetic use was uniform, compared with the university hospital setting. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3064558\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient factors that increase the risk for recurrent inguinal hernia are generally those that disrupt or weaken the tissues, contribute to poor wound healing, or increase the risk for postoperative infection. The most important of these include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-healing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound healing&quot;</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior hernia repair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age at initial hernia presentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal insufficiency </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deficiency of coagulation factor VIII or vitamin C</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, chronic cough, constipation, bowel distention)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85775441\"><span class=\"h3\">Gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With respect to gender, some studies have found higher hernia recurrence rates for women, while others report the opposite. In studies from the Danish Hernia Registry, the overall reoperation rate was 4.3 percent for women and 3.1 percent for men after 29-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. However, with respect to inguinal hernia only, recurrence rates were 5 percent in men and 4 percent in women over five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Femoral hernias may be found more often at reoperation in women initially treated for direct or indirect inguinal hernia at the primary operation compared with men (42 versus 4.6 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]), suggesting a higher incidence of neglected hernia in women, rather than true recurrence. </p><p>Genetic factors may increase the tendency toward recurrent inguinal hernia. In a review of 75 patients with two or more inguinal hernia recurrences, 44 percent had a positive family history of hernia recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Possible mechanisms include a decreased ratio of type <span class=\"nowrap\">I/type</span> III collagen and higher levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2973057\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgeon experience</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low recurrence rates can be achieved for a variety of techniques when the individual performing the surgery has sufficient experience with the specific technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]. Surgeon experience is particularly important with respect to performing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/20,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,38</a>]. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is complex, and the learning curve is more pronounced compared with open hernia repair. Unfortunately, laparoscopic hernia repair continues to be less frequently performed relative to open repair during surgical training, and additional training may be necessary. A Veterans Affairs study found that a case volume of &lt;250 laparoscopic repairs, rather than a greater volume, was significantly associated with a higher risk for hernia recurrence (10 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12662324\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of recurrent inguinal hernia are similar to those of primary inguinal hernia. The surgical technique used for primary hernia repair must be identified to plan recurrent hernia repair. Clinical examination by an experienced surgeon is usually sufficient for detecting recurrent inguinal hernia; however, imaging may be needed for patients with symptoms consistent with a recurrent inguinal hernia but for whom the physical examination does not clearly demonstrate a recurrent hernia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults#H606315346\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias in adults&quot;, section on 'Identifying occult hernia'</a>.)</p><p>On physical examination, systemic symptoms such as fevers, chills, malaise, local findings of pain on palpation, erythema, warmth, swelling, or drainage raise suspicion for mesh infection and alter the course of treatment in the patient with recurrent hernia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wound infection following repair of abdominal wall hernia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54227941\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hernia recurrence can occur immediately, early, or late in the time course following hernia repair. Some authors have used five years to separate early from late recurrence, although a specific timeframe has not been firmly established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/18,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,39</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate recurrence is likely due to technical issues, such as disruption of the repair due to excessive increases in intra-abdominal pressure or trauma. The use of prosthetic material has dramatically diminished technically related immediate recurrences. Some immediate recurrences are neglected hernias that were not identified at the time of the initial operation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early recurrence is generally related to technical (surgeon) factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The rate of early recurrent hernias can be minimized by avoiding undue tension, handling tissue gently to prevent devascularization, and preventing infection. Techniques for inguinal and femoral hernia repair are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-repair-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic inguinal and femoral hernia repair in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late recurrences are related to hernia biology, aging, and other patient-related factors. Late recurrences continue to occur, but at a slightly decreased incidence. Specific recommendations such as weight loss in obese patients, cessation of smoking, and discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy, if possible, may decrease the risk for hernia recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H3064558\" class=\"local\">'Patient factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The majority of recurrences occur within the first three years following hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a review of the Danish Hernia Database, 2.8 percent of reoperations were performed in the first 15 months following hernia repair, and 1.6 percent occurred in the subsequent 15 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a later review of the Danish Hernia Registry, the mean time interval for recurrent hernia repair was 12.6 months for inguinal hernia and 10.3 months for femoral hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The average time from the initial repair to the diagnosis of recurrence in a study focusing on laparoscopic hernia repair was 20 months (range 3 to 84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3069202\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications and contraindications for repair of recurrent inguinal hernias are similar to those of the initial repair.

Although local or regional anesthesia is often used for open repair of primary hernia, we prefer to use general anesthesia or neuraxial anesthesia for recurrent inguinal hernia given the more extensive dissection that is usually needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of anesthesia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2972777\" class=\"local\">'Type of anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85775568\"><span class=\"h1\">MESH FOR RECURRENT HERNIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 90 percent of surgeons in the United States incorporate mesh as a component of a tension-free repair to reduce the risk for recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/5,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,41</a>]. The use of mesh to provide additional tissue support seems appropriate given that recurrent inguinal hernia may be linked to altered extracellular matrix biology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>The use of mesh appears to be equally important for the repair of recurrent inguinal hernia. In a review of the Danish Hernia Database, among 2117 patients with hernia recurrence, 3.1 percent (187 patients) had re-recurrence following recurrent repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Following primary hernia repair using a Lichtenstein technique, a significantly lower rate of re-recurrence was found in patients who underwent subsequent mesh repair compared with non-mesh repair. The re-recurrence rates were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic (mesh): 1.3 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesh (non-Lichtenstein): 7.2 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lichtenstein: 11.3 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-mesh: 19.2 percent</p><p/><p>There is a paucity of data about the preferred type of mesh for recurrent hernia repair. We use polypropylene mesh in most cases, but if the mesh cannot be covered with peritoneum and will be exposed to the intestinal contents, we substitute expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) or coated polypropylene mesh. There are insufficient data on the long-term durability of biologic mesh in recurrent inguinal hernia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85775634\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO RECURRENT INGUINAL HERNIA REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inguinal hernias should be repaired using a tension-free mesh repair whenever possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The choice of technique is largely anatomically based, depending upon the nature of the prior hernia repair, given that no significant differences in re-recurrence rates have been demonstrated in randomized trials comparing open and laparoscopic techniques for recurrent hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/20,43-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,43-48</a>].

Each of the above techniques for inguinal hernia repair, including important technical points for recurrent inguinal hernia repair using the Lichtenstein and laparoscopic techniques, is discussed elsewhere.

Open mesh repairs included the Lichtenstein and giant prosthesis for reinforcement of the visceral sac (GPRVS) techniques. Totally extraperitoneal (TEP) and transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) procedures were used for laparoscopic repair. Primary outcomes included the rate of re-recurrence and chronic pain. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, superficial wound infection, operating time, time to return to daily activities, wound seromas or hematomas, and complications requiring additional surgical procedures. The following findings were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a pooled analysis, there were no significant differences between laparoscopic and open hernia repair for the primary outcomes of re-recurrence (odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.33-2.17) or chronic pain (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.14-5.88).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic repair was associated with significantly less postoperative pain (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31-0.84), fewer superficial wound infections (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08-0.96), shorter time to return to daily activities and work (weighted mean difference [WMD] 0.82 days, 95% CI 0.36-1.27 days), but longer operative times (WMD 0.68 min, 95% CI 0.23-1.13). There were no differences identified for wound seroma or hematoma or the need for additional surgical procedures.</p><p/><p>A separate meta-analysis that combined the results of five randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/43,44,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44,46-48</a>] and seven other studies (5 retrospective and 2 prospective) assessed outcomes in 1542 patients with recurrent hernias repaired using laparoscopic (TEP or TAPP) or open (Lichtenstein or preperitoneal) techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. No significant differences were seen for early re-recurrence (relative risk [RR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.21-2.51) or overall re-recurrence (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.45-1.15). No differences were seen for the various techniques for postoperative wound infection, urinary retention, testicular <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/discomfort,</span> or neuralgia. Comparing laparoscopic techniques, the risk of overall re-recurrence was significantly higher for laparoscopic TAPP compared with TEP technique (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.32-7.90). Because of insufficient data, no comparisons were made between TAPP and Lichtenstein, TEP and preperitoneal, or TAPP and preperitoneal. A subsequent meta-analysis that included two additional randomized trials comparing open versus laparoscopic repair found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>A large retrospective review of 19,582 operations for recurrent hernia compared laparoscopic repair with other techniques (eg, suture closure, Lichtenstein, plug) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The laparoscopic and open mesh approaches were significantly associated with the lowest rates of re-recurrence following prior open (anterior) repair; however, no technique differed significantly for recurrent hernia repair following prior preperitoneal repair (laparoscopic or preperitoneal [open]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12664664\"><span class=\"h2\">Suggested approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With respect to the risk for re-recurrence, open and laparoscopic repair of recurrent hernia appear equivalent (as discussed in the section above); thus, we use an anatomic approach that avoids previously dissected tissue planes. Most open repairs are performed anterior to the hernia defect (except the uncommonly performed Kugel repair), and laparoscopic repair is performed posterior to the hernia defect. Thus, in general, failed posterior repairs should be repaired using an anterior approach, and vice versa, failed anterior repairs should be repaired using a posterior approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a failed posterior repair (eg, laparoscopic, preperitoneal), a Lichtenstein repair, which has been shown to be superior to other open, anterior repairs, should be used. However, a standard Lichtenstein repair cannot be used if the hernia recurrence is at the femoral site. Under this circumstance, an infrainguinal mesh plug repair or a modified Lichtenstein repair can be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H791243\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Choice of repair'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H7688065\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Recurrent hernia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a failed anterior mesh repair (eg, Lichtenstein), a laparoscopic TEP or TAPP repair should be used preferentially over an open preperitoneal approach because laparoscopic repair is associated with fewer perioperative complications and less postoperative pain. Moreover, in the laparoscopic era, more surgeons would be comfortable with the laparoscopic approach compared with the open preperitoneal repair technique. A particular laparoscopic technique (ie, TEP or TAPP) may have advantages under specific clinical circumstances, but for most patients, we suggest a TEP approach, which appears to be associated with a lower risk of re-recurrence following recurrent hernia repair compared with TAPP (discussed in the previous section). However, for patients with prior pelvic surgery, for which TEP repair may not be possible, either a TAPP or open preperitoneal repair can be used. When the exact location of the recurrent hernia is unclear, a laparoscopic TAPP approach allows all potential hernia defects (eg, direct, indirect, and femoral) to be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For patients with a failed anterior repair performed without mesh, an anterior mesh repair (eg, Lichtenstein) may also be an acceptable option; however, given the challenges of dissection in a reoperative field, most surgeons prefer a laparoscopic approach.

Risk factors associated with a failed primary inguinal hernia repair include the site of the prior hernia repair, technical issues (eg, non-mesh repair, inadequate mesh), patient-related factors (eg, inherited collagen deficiency, medication), and surgeon experience.
