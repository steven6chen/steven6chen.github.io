Primary prevention of SCD refers to medical or interventional therapy undertaken to prevent SCD in patients who have not experienced symptomatic life-threatening sustained <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) but who are felt to be at an increased risk for such an event. The primary prevention of SCD in patients with HF and cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction, either due to coronary heart disease or a dilated nonischemic etiology, will be reviewed here with emphasis on the role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). The different types of ventricular arrhythmias, the effects of HF therapy on ventricular arrhythmias, the role of electrophysiologic testing, and the secondary prevention of SCD are discussed separately.

Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are the most common arrhythmic causes of SCD, although bradyarrhythmias and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) are responsible in 5 to 33 percent of cases. These issues are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

Therefore, such patients are not usually considered appropriate candidates for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy unless this is used as a bridge to transplantation or implanted in conjunction with CRT. The mode of death in patients with HF is more likely to be &quot;sudden&quot; in patients with class II or III HF, while the mode of death is more likely to be related to &quot;pump&quot; failure in patients with class IV HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98258 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, primary prevention ICD trials (in the absence of CRT) have excluded patients with NYHA class IV HF. In fact, the 2017 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/Heart</span> Rhythm Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC/HRS)</span> Guidelines state that &quot;ICD therapy is not indicated for NYHA Class IV patients with medication-refractory HF who are not also candidates for cardiac transplantation, an LVAD (left ventricular assist device), or CRT-D,&quot; listing this as a class III indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In addition, only a subset of patients with cardiomyopathy develops sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias or SCD. As such, the risk stratification of patients prior to ICD therapy is important for providing therapy to patients at highest risk of SCD and minimizing the number of ICD implantations in patients who are unlikely to benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547145918\"><span class=\"h2\">SCD risk prediction post-MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of clinical features have been evaluated as a means for identifying patients at the greatest risk of SCD following an acute myocardial infarction (MI).

Additionally, these markers may allow for the identification of patients at highest risk of non-arrhythmic mortality in the two to three years following ICD implantation, a group of patients who generally derive little or no benefit from the ICD.</p><p>The CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score, well validated as a risk assessment tool in patients with atrial fibrillation, may also be predictive of total mortality risk among ICD recipients. In a retrospective cohort analysis of 2258 ICD recipients in a single health care system (mean age 66 years, 78 percent male) who were followed for an average of 5.4 years post-ICD implantation, 1195 patients (53 percent) died during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The average CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score was 3.2&plusmn;1.5, with 26 percent increased hazard of all cause death for each one-point increment of CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score (adjusted HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.20-1.32). Additional studies are required to validate the role of CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score in this setting. </p><p>Importantly, compared with matched patients without an ICD, patients &ge;65 years of age receiving a primary prevention ICD derive a similar mortality benefit regardless of gender. Among a cohort of 490 female patients from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD registry (with 490 propensity matched controls from the Get With The Guidelines Heart Failure registry) with a median follow-up of 4.6 years, female patients with an ICD had significantly lower all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This mortality benefit is similar to the mortality benefit in male patients (adjusted HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65-0.83). </p><p>Other risk stratification schemes have been proposed that incorporate both clinical and serum-based biomarkers. Of 1189 primary-prevention ICD patients in the PROSE-ICD registry, a retrospectively-applied risk score consisting of six clinical factors and three biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor II, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and cardiac troponin T) stratified the population's one-year mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients with zero to one, two to three, four to six, or seven to nine risk factors had one-year mortality rates of 0.8, 2.7, 16.1, and 46.2 percent respectively.</p><p>While these novel risk stratification schemes derived from retrospective studies generate important hypotheses, readers should note that none has yet been prospectively validated in independent populations. Therefore, traditional risk stratification based on LVEF, HF class, and arrhythmia inducibility continue to form the basis for recommendations regarding ICD use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H935487333\"><span class=\"h3\">Myocardial fibrosis on CMR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of myocardial fibrosis, identified by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, has been associated with a greater risk of ventricular arrhythmias or SCD in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis, which included 2948 patients from 29 observational studies, assessed the relationship between LGE and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Mean LVEF in the various cohorts ranged from 20 to 43 percent, and LGE was identified in 44 percent (reported as present or not without quantification of the extent of LGE). Over a mean follow-up of three years, the primary endpoint (sustained ventricular arrhythmia, appropriate ICD intervention, or SCD) occurred in 350 patients, including 21 percent of patients with LGE (compared with 4.7 percent of patients without LGE; pooled odds ratio [OR] 4.3, 95% CI 3.3-5.8). Notably, subgroup analysis revealed that LGE was able to risk stratify patients at all levels of LVEF (both above and below 35 percent) and was most powerful among patients with ICDs previously placed for primary prevention (OR 7.8, 95% CI 1.7-35.8). </p><p>LGE appears to be a robust predictor of ventricular arrhythmias or SCD across a wide spectrum of patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, including those with mean LVEFs &gt;35 percent. While not currently utilized in SCD risk stratification guidelines, if these data are confirmed in larger prospective studies, then LGE on CMR may become a criterion used in future risk stratification schemes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2040004225\"><span class=\"h2\">SCD risk prediction in the general population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite decades of trials looking into a variety of different clinical factors in an effort to risk stratify patients for SCD, LVEF remains the primary entry criterion for primary prevention ICD trials and a major component of guideline-based indications for receiving a primary prevention ICD among patients with HF and a cardiomyopathy. However, more persons die annually from SCD in the general population than in the HF population, and SCD is often the initial manifestation of underlying cardiovascular disease.</p><p>In an effort to derive an SCD risk prediction model for the general population, investigators derived a prediction model using 1367 patients from the ARIC study and validated the model using 4207 patients from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), both populations who were free of cardiovascular disease at the time of enrollment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Twelve independent risk factors for SCD were identified and included age, male gender, black race, current smoking, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medication, diabetes, serum potassium, serum albumin, HDL, estimated GFR, and QTc interval. Over a 10-year follow-up period, the derived risk model was effective at discriminating the risk for SCD (c-statistic 0.820 and 0.745 for ARIC and CHS populations, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14874389\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF AN ICD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because patients with HF and cardiomyopathy are at risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and SCD is often the first presentation of a ventricular arrhythmia, there is a significant therapeutic role for the primary prevention of SCD. As in secondary prevention, randomized clinical trials have established a clear role for primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in selected patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98261\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98261 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F96488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96488 \">table 2</a>). In contrast, antiarrhythmic drugs other than beta blockers do not appear to improve outcomes.

In a meta-analysis that included 4306 patients from six randomized trials comparing ICDs with medical therapy for primary prevention of SCD (MADIT, MADIT II, DEFINITE, SCD HeFT, AMIOVIRT, and CAT), ICD therapy resulted in a 29 percent reduction (95% CI 20-37 percent) in overall mortality compared with standard medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the risk of death due to other causes (eg, progressive HF) also increases with worsening HF and LV systolic dysfunction.

These include late potentials on signal-averaged ECG (SAECG), reduced heart rate variability (HRV), and T-wave or repolarization alternans (TWA). Although each of these abnormalities is associated with arrhythmic risk, available data do not support incorporating them into the criteria for ICD implantation. </p><p>The potential role of cardiac MRI in identifying patients at risk for development of future ventricular arrhythmias is evolving, with the precise role for cardiac MRI in risk stratification for ICD therapy still to be determined. A 2014 meta-analysis of nine studies involving 1488 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy found that the presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac MRI was associated with a significantly increased total mortality (OR 3.3) and SCD (OR 5.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One study followed 362 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe LV dysfunction for a mean of 5.4 years and found that the size of the peri-infarct zone on cardiac MRI was an independent predictor of overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In addition, only a subset of patients with cardiomyopathy develops sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias or SCD. Therefore, risk stratification of patients prior to considering ICD therapy is important for targeting therapy to patients at highest risk of SCD and minimizing the number of ICD implantations in patients who are unlikely to benefit. (See <a href=\"#H547145912\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommendations for selecting the optimal patients for ICD therapy are based largely upon the entry criteria in the major trials. Prior to recommending ICD therapy for the primary prevention of SCD, there should be a reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for at least one year regardless of the indication for ICD therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who meet criteria for insertion of an ICD for the primary prevention of SCD, in the absence of a contraindication, we recommend optimizing guideline-directed medical therapy with a beta blocker and either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker <strong>prior</strong> to ICD implantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H547147053\" class=\"local\">'Guideline-directed medical therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction#H27823757\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with cardiomyopathy due to ischemic heart disease, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &le;35 percent, and associated heart failure (HF) with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III status, we recommend ICD therapy for primary prevention of SCD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Patients should be evaluated at least 40 days post-myocardial infarction (MI) and more than three months following revascularization. (See <a href=\"#H362963650\" class=\"local\">'Ischemic cardiomyopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with cardiomyopathy due to ischemic heart disease, LVEF &le;30 percent, and NYHA functional class I status, we recommend ICD therapy for primary prevention of SCD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Patients should be evaluated at least 40 days post-MI and more than three months following revascularization. (See <a href=\"#H362963650\" class=\"local\">'Ischemic cardiomyopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, LVEF &le;35 percent, and associated HF with NYHA functional class II or III status, we suggest ICD therapy for primary prevention of SCD rather than optimal medical therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). ICDs are very effective at reducing total mortality and mortality from SCD, although the benefits of an ICD on total mortality may be diminished in the setting of guideline-directed optimal medical therapy and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). All patients receiving an ICD for primary prevention of SCD should be treated with at least three months of guideline-directed medical therapy prior to ICD implantation. (See <a href=\"#H14874407\" class=\"local\">'Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with an LVEF &le;35 percent, HF with NYHA functional class III or IV status, and a QRS duration &ge;120 milliseconds, we recommend implantation of a combined CRT-D device (biventricular pacing combined with an ICD) rather than an ICD alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Strongest consideration for the CRT component should be given for those patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) QRS morphology, those with QRS duration &ge;150 milliseconds, and those dependent upon ventricular pacing due to atrioventricular block. (See <a href=\"#H539450914\" class=\"local\">'COMPANION trial of ICD combined with CRT'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The role of ICD therapy for primary prevention of SCD in patients with HF and NYHA class IV status who have a narrow QRS complex has not been well-studied, as NYHA class IV patients have generally been excluded from randomized primary prevention ICD trials due to high expected mortality rate. For ambulatory patients with NYHA class IV HF, an LVEF &le;35 percent, and a narrow QRS complex (ie, no dyssynchrony) who are awaiting cardiac transplantation outside the hospital, it is reasonable to consider ICD implantation as a bridge to transplantation.
