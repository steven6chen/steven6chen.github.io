If blood doesn't clot normally, people can bleed very easily or much more than normal. The bleeding can sometimes be life-threatening.</p><p>People with hemophilia are missing a protein in the blood called a &quot;clotting factor.&quot; Without this, the blood can't clot normally. There are 2 types of hemophilia (called &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;), depending on which clotting factor is the problem:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hemophilia A, factor 8 (also written as &quot;factor VIII&quot;) is missing or very low.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hemophilia B, factor 9 (also written as &quot;factor IX&quot;) is missing or very low.</p><p/><p>Hemophilia is a life-long condition that a person is born with. It is caused by an abnormal gene. Sometimes, parents pass this abnormal gene to their child. In some of these cases, parents might not know they have the abnormal gene, because they don't have any symptoms. Boys and men are most likely to have hemophilia. It is very rare in girls or women.</p><p>Hemophilia can be mild or severe. There is no cure for the disease, but it can be managed with different treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864641766\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hemophilia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on how mild or severe a person's hemophilia is. Some children start having symptoms from birth. For example, a baby boy might bleed much more than normal if he has a procedure to remove the skin that covers the tip of the penis (called &quot;circumcision&quot;). Other children, especially those with mild hemophilia, start having symptoms later on.</p><p>People with mild hemophilia usually bleed more than normal after an injury, procedure, or surgery.</p><p>People with severe hemophilia also bleed more than normal after an injury, procedure, or surgery. But they can also have bleeding that happens for no reason at all. This type of bleeding usually happens in a joint. The joints most often involved are the ankles, knees, and elbows. Blood in a joint can cause pain, swelling, stiffness, and trouble moving the joint. Over time, repeated bleeding in a joint can lead to long-term joint pain and damage.</p><p>Symptoms can also happen from bleeding in other parts of the body. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in a bowel movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain (from bleeding into the belly wall)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruises or bleeding in a muscle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding in the brain or spinal cord</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864641781\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hemophilia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can check for hemophilia by doing different blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161658739\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women who have the hemophilia gene have the chance of passing the gene along to their baby. Genetic testing can show if you have the gene. If you do, doctors can do a few things to help prevent problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do an ultrasound to find out the sex of your baby &ndash; This is because only a male baby would be at risk of having severe hemophilia. If the baby is male, doctors will avoid certain procedures during labor and delivery that could cause bleeding. In most cases, the baby is tested after birth to find out if he does have hemophilia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepare for a safe birth &ndash; Some women who carry the gene are at risk of abnormal bleeding. Your doctor will test your clotting factor levels. This can help them avoid or prepare for procedures that might cause bleeding. Depending on your levels, you might also need treatment for bleeding after the baby is born.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864641798\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hemophilia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on how severe a person's hemophilia is. It also depends on whether the person is going to have a procedure or surgery.</p><p>The main treatment for hemophilia is called &quot;factor replacement therapy.&quot; This involves getting the clotting factor that the body is missing. There are different types of replacement clotting factors. Some are made from human blood, and others aren't. Replacement therapy goes into a vein. People can get this treatment in the hospital, or they can give it to themselves (or have someone else give it to them) at home.</p><p>Replacement therapy is used in 2 ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To treat a bleed when it happens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On a regular basis, to prevent bleeding</p><p/><p>Some people have something called an &quot;inhibitor&quot; in their blood. This can make factor replacement therapy not work as well. This is more common in hemophilia A than in hemophilia B. If tests show that you have an inhibitor, you might need other treatments. Your doctor will talk to you about the options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864641813\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about replacement therapy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, factor replacement therapy made from human blood sometimes had viruses in it. This could include HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, which could then infect the person being treated for hemophilia. Today, replacement therapy is made in a safer way and does not contain HIV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864641828\"><span class=\"h1\">What else can people with hemophilia do to avoid bleeding problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To avoid bleeding problems, people with hemophilia should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See their doctor for regular visits</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let every doctor who takes care of them know they have hemophilia, and which type (&quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow their doctor's instructions about treatment and which activities or sports to avoid (if any)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn the signs and symptoms of bleeding, and how to treat it</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Not</strong> take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or medicines called NSAIDs without the input of a doctor &ndash; Common NSAIDs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plan ahead for any procedures or surgery that could cause bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take good care of their teeth and see their dentist for regular visits</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take their replacement therapy with them when travelling</p><p/><p>If your child has hemophilia, you should let caregivers, daycare, or the school know. Teach them which symptoms to watch for, and how to treat a bleed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864641843\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I learn more about hemophilia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To learn more, talk with your doctor or nurse. The Hemophilia Foundation also has a lot of information.
