This reflects a variety of complaints including vocal tremor, weakness, fatigue, altered pitch, breathiness, or strained voice quality.</p><p>The approach to the adult who presents with hoarseness will be reviewed here. The approach to hoarseness in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hoarseness-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hoarseness in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LARYNGEAL ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main functions of the larynx involve phonation, respiration, swallowing, and Valsalva:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phonation refers to production of a primary vocal tone at the level of the vocal folds. Vocal quality is then modified by resonation through the upper airway and sinonasal tract and articulated into speech.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway patency and protection is important during respiration and swallowing. The normal swallow mechanism includes laryngeal elevation, posterior deflection of the epiglottis, inhibition of respiration, and closure of the vocal folds to prevent aspiration of ingested material.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valsalva represents generation of increased pressure against a tightly closed glottis. This enables functions such as cough, straining, throat clearing, and defecation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy of the larynx</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The larynx is comprised of a cartilaginous skeleton, muscles (extrinsic and intrinsic), and a mucosal lining (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79855 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Cartilages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The larynx is suspended from the hyoid bone in the anterior neck by soft tissue attachments. The laryngeal skeleton consists of nine cartilages. The arytenoid, corniculate, and cuneiform cartilages are paired, whereas the thyroid, cricoid, and epiglottis are unpaired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56206 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The thyroid cartilage is the largest and forms a protective shield-like shape in front of the vocal folds. Its midline projection is commonly referred to as the &quot;Adam's apple&quot; and tends to be more prominent in men.</p><p>The cricoid cartilage, which lies below the thyroid cartilage and above the entrance to the trachea, is the only complete ring of the laryngeal skeleton. The cricoid cartilage encloses the subglottic region of the larynx. Stenosis may form if the mucosa in this region is injured, as can occur with prolonged endotracheal tube intubation.</p><p>The arytenoids are pyramidal-shaped cartilages positioned on the upper border of the posterior cricoid cartilage; these attach at the synovial cricoarytenoid joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56206 \">figure 2</a>). The arytenoids serve as attachment sites for some of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and allow complex movement and fine adjustment of the vocal folds. Fibrosis or fixation of the cricoarytenoid joint, as can be seen with rheumatoid arthritis or following trauma, can result in vocal fold immobility and respiratory or phonatory impairment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Vocal folds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true vocal folds are bands of tissue comprised of muscle, fibrous ligament, and mucosa extending from the arytenoids posteriorly to the midline thyroid cartilage anteriorly.</p><p>The false (or &quot;ventricular&quot;) vocal folds are situated superior to the true vocal folds and are separated from them by a lateral recess termed the laryngeal ventricle. The ventricle contains mucus-producing glands that provide lubrication for the true vocal folds, which are themselves devoid of glandular elements. The false vocal folds are adducted only during effortful closure, as with Valsalva and reflex laryngeal closure due to noxious stimuli. They do not normally approximate during phonation; however, this may be observed in pathologic conditions, such as in patients with incompetent true vocal fold closure due to vocal fold paralysis, mass lesion, or presbyphonia (vocal fold changes due to aging of the larynx).</p><p>The larynx is subdivided into three regions: the supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis. The supraglottis encompasses the area above the true vocal folds and includes the epiglottis, false vocal folds, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids. The glottis consists of the true vocal folds and the immediate subjacent area extending 1 cm inferiorly. The subglottis refers to the region beginning at the inferior edge of the glottis and extending down to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Extrinsic and intrinsic muscles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The muscles of the larynx are divided into extrinsic and intrinsic muscles. The extrinsic group, including the anterior strap muscles and digastrics, affects the position of the entire larynx in the neck. This is important for laryngeal elevation during swallowing and fixation of the larynx during Valsalva. The intrinsic muscles are much more delicate and are responsible for movement of the vocal folds within the larynx as well as subtle tension adjustments related to phonation. The main intrinsic muscles are: posterior cricoarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, interarytenoid, thyroarytenoid, and cricothyroid.</p><p>The thyroarytenoid muscle makes up the bulk of the true vocal fold. Movement at the cricoarytenoid joint allows the vocal folds to be approximated in the midline (adducted) during phonation or drawn apart laterally (abducted) during inspiration.</p><p>The vocal fold mucosa is composed of non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, whereas the remainder of the larynx is lined by respiratory (ciliated pseudostratified columnar) epithelium; this enables the surface of the vocal fold to better withstand the repetitive trauma of high-velocity contact with the contralateral vocal fold. The subepithelial layer, known as Reinke's space or superficial lamina propria, contains mucopolysaccharides and mucoproteins that give it a viscous consistency. This facilitates vibration of the vocal fold mucosa over the deeper tissue layers which are more dense and fibrous. Scarring and stiffness of these layers can impair vibration with subsequent degradation of vocal quality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Nerve supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vagus nerve innervates the laryngopharynx. The recurrent laryngeal nerves branch from the vagus in the upper chest and reenter the neck in the thoracic inlet. The recurrent laryngeal nerve travels underneath the subclavian artery on the right side, and around the arch of the aorta on the left side.</p><p>The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates all intrinsic muscles except for the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Additional motor function of the lower pharynx and upper esophagus is supplied by direct pharyngeal branches of the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerve. A mass lesion along the course of these nerves can result in vocal fold paralysis.</p><p>Sensory function above the level of the vocal folds is mediated by the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Sensory function below the level of the vocal folds is transmitted through the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The vagus nerve receives sensory information from the external auditory canal as well as the hypopharynx. Thus, a reflex cough can be provoked by instrumenting the ear during cleaning, and cancer present in the hypopharynx may result in ear pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Phonation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phonation is generated by the interaction of aerodynamic forces of the exhaled air column with the viscoelastic properties of the true vocal fold mucosa as the vocal folds are held approximated (adducted) in the midline. This results in a vibratory, oscillating wave in the superficial layers of the vocal fold as air is expelled from the lungs.</p><p>Oscillation occurs about 100 to 300 times per second (Hz) during speech, and is greater than 1000 Hz in a soprano while singing. This is too fast for the human eye to perceive, and special techniques (such as videostroboscopy) are needed to capture vocal fold vibration. The frequency of vibration is perceived by the ear as pitch. Pitch is mainly determined by vocal fold length and tension and is regulated by minute adjustments of the cricothyroid muscle. Increase in mass of the vocal fold can also alter pitch, as seen with polyps or an increased amount of tissue in Reinke's space in smokers.</p><p>The glottic vocal tone is produced at the level of the glottis (true vocal folds); it then resonates in the pharynx and nose, adding harmonics and timbre, and is articulated by fine motor control of the tongue, palate, and lips. A patient with cleft palate may have normal vocal fold function but will have a hypernasal voice due to the palatal defect and poor velopharyngeal closure (resulting in excess air escape through the nose). By contrast, a patient with nasal congestion may exhibit hyponasal resonance due to inadequate air escape through the nose. The dysarthric patient may have normal vocal fold function but abnormal articulation secondary to neurologic dysfunction of the tongue or lips.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF HOARSENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hoarseness may be due to either functional or organic causes. Any patient with persistent hoarseness should be evaluated in order to establish a diagnosis. In the absence of symptoms of an acute upper respiratory infection, patients with hoarseness persisting for more than two weeks should be referred for a complete otolaryngologic examination. This is especially important in the setting of associated risk factors for head and neck cancer (primarily tobacco and alcohol use), or worrisome coexistent symptomatology such as severe cough, hemoptysis, unilateral ear or throat pain, odynophagia, dysphagia, or unexplained weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Causes of hoarseness may be considered in the following categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute laryngitis, which is self-limited and related to acute respiratory illness or acute voice misuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic laryngitis, which is related to irritants, reflux, chronic infection (such as fungal), or habitual vocal misuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign vocal fold lesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-organic (&quot;functional&quot;) issues</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic conditions and rare causes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute laryngitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute laryngitis is a common and self-limited inflammatory condition lasting less than three weeks and usually associated with either an upper respiratory tract infection or acute vocal strain. <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> have been isolated from the nasopharynx of adults with acute laryngitis, even though the etiology of infection in most cases is thought to be viral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Hoarseness resulting from an upper respiratory tract infection is often associated with rhinorrhea, cough, and mild sore throat. Acute vocal strain, such as screaming or protracted coughing, can also result in submucosal microtrauma of the vocal fold, with focal edema and hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic laryngitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When laryngitis persists beyond three weeks, it is defined as chronic laryngitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Irritants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic laryngitis is typically associated with one or more chronic irritants which, over time, lead to persistent inflammation. Examples include inhaled toxins (such as chemical fumes), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), chronic sinusitis with postnasal drip, chronic alcohol use, and chronic vocal strain. In addition to increasing the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, tobacco smoke irritates the vocal folds and can cause benign changes such as keratosis and polypoid corditis. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Polypoid corditis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Laryngopharyngeal reflux</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) results from the retrograde movement of gastric contents (acid and enzymes such as pepsin) beyond the upper esophageal sphincter, leading to morphologic and functional changes in the larynx and pharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Substantial evidence suggests a relationship between reflux and posterior laryngitis, including interarytenoid hypertrophy and contact ulceration with or without granuloma formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laryngopharyngeal-reflux\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laryngopharyngeal reflux&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common symptoms associated with LPR are throat clearing (98.3 percent), persistent cough (96.6 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">heartburn/dyspepsia</span> (95.7 percent), globus sensation (lump in the throat feeling; 94.9 percent), and change in voice quality (hoarseness; 94.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other symptoms include sore throat, dysphagia, and laryngospasm or choking sensation. Symptoms characteristically vary over time. Reflux esophagitis may not be present in patients with symptomatic reflux affecting the laryngopharynx and testing may not definitively demonstrate the presence of acid. The diagnosis of LPR is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laryngopharyngeal-reflux#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laryngopharyngeal reflux&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle tension dysphonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The larynx can be affected by abnormal hyperfunctional mechanisms and imbalance of tension in muscles involved in voice production leading to dysphonia. Muscle tension dysphonia is considered either a psychologic or neurologic dystonic disorder.</p><p>In the primary form of vocal hyperfunction, true vocal fold morphology and motion are observed to be normal. Inappropriate contraction and closure (adduction) of the false vocal folds occurs during phonation, with generation of excessive strain and effort. There may also be contraction of the entire supraglottis, obscuring visualization of the true vocal folds.</p><p>In the secondary form, false vocal fold compression may be seen as a compensatory mechanism for incompetence at the level of the true vocal folds. Such incomplete closure of the true vocal folds may be due to vocal fold paralysis, atrophy (as seen with aging, where superficial lamina propria is lost from Reinke's space), and mass lesions preventing approximation of the vocal fold edges (such as nodules or polyps).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign vocal fold lesions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Polypoid corditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polypoid corditis is also known as Reinke's edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60165\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60165 \">picture 1</a>). Viscous material accumulates in the superficial lamina propria (Reinke's space) of the true vocal folds as a result of chronic irritation and inflammation secondary to smoking. The vocal folds appear swollen and &quot;floppy&quot; and may cause respiratory symptoms in severe cases. The condition is frequently seen in middle-aged women and causes a husky, low-pitched voice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In these cases, the patient often complains of &quot;sounding like a man.&quot; A similar clinical appearance can be seen in patients with hypothyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Polyps and nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both polyps and nodules on the vocal fold are manifestations of chronic vocal fold irritation. Etiologic factors include smoking, reflux, and muscle tension dysphonia. Some polyps form following traumatic hemorrhage into the vocal fold from vocal abuse or coughing (&quot;hemorrhagic polyp&quot;). Polyps tend to be unilateral, although a contralateral smaller &quot;contact lesion&quot; is often seen which arises from damage to the opposing vocal fold in the setting of repeated contact against the primary mass lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64623%7EPC%2F77614\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64623 graphicRef77614 \">picture 2A-B</a>). They present in the anterior one-third of the vocal fold and are seen more frequently in men.</p><p>Nodules are sometimes also called &quot;singer's&quot; or &quot;screamer's&quot; nodes. They occur bilaterally and generally appear relatively symmetric (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73976\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73976 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. They are more common in women and children and are also frequently seen in the setting of vocal abuse. The early nodule is edematous and becomes thickened and fibrotic with ongoing vocal fold microtrauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Laryngeal cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of laryngeal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53676\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53676 \">picture 4</a>). Major risk factors include smoking and alcohol abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Squamous cell carcinoma is epithelial, arising from the mucosal surface of the larynx, and tends to metastasize to regional cervical nodes. Early lesions may appear initially as white (leukoplakic) plaques; they can be asymptomatic or present with hoarseness depending on location within the larynx. Advanced malignant lesions can be large and exophytic or deeply ulcerative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic dysfunction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Unilateral paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury causes the affected vocal fold to rest in the paramedian (or partially lateralized) position. The glottic airway is usually adequate and airway complaints are rare. The contralateral vocal fold may or may not compensate to provide adequate glottic closure during phonation. If closure is not achieved, the residual glottal gap results in air escape with a weak, breathy voice secondary to a &quot;leaky valve&quot; phenomenon. Glottal incompetence also presents risk of aspiration, particularly with thin liquids. Cough, which requires transient tight glottic closure, may be ineffectual. Associated sensory loss (particularly in the case of stroke) may also complicate swallowing.</p><p>The etiology of unilateral vocal fold paralysis includes: [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra-laryngeal malignancy of the skull base, neck, or thorax invading the vagus or recurrent laryngeal nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93712\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93712 \">image 1</a>). Vocal fold paralysis in the setting of a thyroid nodule should raise suspicion of invasive thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic injury to the recurrent laryngeal or vagus nerves during procedures in the neck, chest, and skull base (eg, thyroid and parathyroid surgery, carotid endarterectomy, cardiothoracic procedures and anterior cervical approaches to the cervical spine for disk surgery), as well as complication of endotracheal intubation.

A review of over 700 cases of idiopathic unilateral paralysis found that complete and partial recovery of motion occurred in approximately 40 percent of patients, with complete and partial voice recovery in 60 percent; spontaneous recovery was rare after one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>A 20-year retrospective study of causes of vocal fold immobility shows that non-thyroid neck surgery has become the most common cause of vocal fold paralysis over the past 10 years, whereas extralaryngeal malignancies had previously been the most common cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Bilateral paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral vocal fold paralysis causes a different constellation of symptoms. The bilaterally denervated vocal folds may be positioned near the midline, with a narrow glottic aperture. Voice is usually good with this glottic configuration, but respiratory function can be compromised. Symptoms range from minimal dyspnea or inspiratory stridor to severe respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Bilateral vocal fold paralysis is usually iatrogenic, secondary to neck surgery or tracheal intubation. Neurologic disorders, including ALS, diabetic neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, neurologic sequelae of organophosphate pesticide toxicity or therapeutic administration of vinca alkaloids, stroke, head injury, and hydrocephalus or brainstem compression associated with Arnold-Chiari malformation may also be etiologic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

It results in involuntary contraction of the laryngeal muscles and is often characterized by a halting, strained, strangled voice quality. This is especially notable with vowels and results from uncoordinated forceful adduction during phonation (adductor type). The less common abductor type of spasmodic dysphonia results in voiceless gaps in speech secondary to dysregulation of vocal fold abduction. Spasmodic dysphonia is not felt to be psychogenic in origin, although many patients report initial onset of symptoms following a stressful life event. Symptoms may improve with whispering, laughing, or singing. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and treatment usually involves botulinum toxin injection into the larynx.

Approximately one-quarter of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis present with voice or other otolaryngologic symptoms as their initial complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Tremor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tremor is a rhythmic, oscillatory movement occurring at rest or with action. Several primary neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease and multiple sclerosis, can cause resting and intention laryngeal tremors. Tremors may also occur with stroke and tumor. Approximately 25 to 30 percent of patients with essential tremor have laryngeal tremor; laryngeal tremor may present in isolation but more commonly occurs with tremor elsewhere in the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Myasthenia gravis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with myasthenia gravis may develop fluctuating hoarseness, sometimes associated with dysphagia and stridor.

Laryngeal amyloidosis usually causes hoarseness or progressive dysphonia, though patients may also present with dyspnea, cough, stridor, odynophagia, and rarely hemoptysis. Laryngeal examination typically reveals a firm orange-yellow to grey epithelial nodule.

A history of smoking and alcohol use increases the risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. Referred ear pain via cranial nerves IX and X may represent one of the first symptoms of laryngopharyngeal cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864174268\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should begin by noting the quality of the patient's voice. Many voice disturbances are typically described by the catch-all term &quot;hoarseness,&quot; but should be more critically evaluated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hoarseness is a coarse, scratchy sound that frequently correlates with irregularity of the medial, or vibratory, edge of the true vocal fold. Underlying pathology may relate to laryngitis, an early vocal fold malignancy, a benign mass lesion, vocal fold hemorrhage, or mucosal disruption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathiness is a term describing the perception of excessive air escape during phonation, in which the voice sounds or feels &quot;weak.&quot; This is usually secondary to incomplete closure of the vocal folds, as seen with vocal fold paralysis, atrophy, mass lesions preventing contact of the vocal fold edges, and pathology of the cricoarytenoid joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vocal fatigue refers to degradation in vocal quality and loss of control of vocal quality with extended periods of voice use. This can be secondary to local anatomic or physiological factors at the level of the vocal folds; poor vocal technique with misuse of neck or abdominal musculature; or systemic conditions such as dehydration, neuromuscular disorders, generalized malaise, or de-conditioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The voice may sound wet, gurgling, full, or &quot;hot-potato-like,&quot; as with peritonsillar abscess or supraglottic tumor mass with salivary pooling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The voice may exhibit a tremulous quality, and tremor may be seen on exam. Inability to produce any sound is described as aphonia.</p><p/><p>Although not absolutely definitive, various voice qualities may correlate with underlying etiologies for the voice disorder.</p><p>The physical examination should include an assessment of the ears, upper airway mucosa, oral cavity (including tongue mobility), cranial nerve function, and respiration. Systemic diseases should be considered when suggested by symptoms or examination, including hypothyroidism, neurologic conditions such as tremor, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Patients with hoarseness persisting for more than two weeks, in the absence of symptoms of an acute respiratory infection, should have a complete head and neck examination with visualization of the laryngopharynx by an otolaryngologist. This may be performed on the awake patient by indirect laryngoscopy using a mirror or via transnasal or transoral laryngoscopy with a digital or fiberoptic endoscope. In some cases, examination under general anesthesia may be necessary.</p><p>The examination should emphasize complete visualization of the true and false vocal folds, epiglottis, pyriform sinus, and vallecula. Computed tomography (CT) scanning or other radiographic evaluation is not a substitute for direct laryngeal examination, although it may serve as a valuable adjunct. Additional evaluation of the vibratory characteristics of the vocal fold may be necessary and is most commonly achieved using high-magnification endoscopy under stroboscopic lighting (strobovideolaryngoscopy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H292295003\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment options for hoarseness vary depending on the underlying etiology. Treatment generally consists of voice rest, voice therapy, pharmacotherapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Voice rest is used for acute laryngitis, vocal fold hemorrhage, and other conditions where there is acute&nbsp;laryngeal edema and swelling. During voice rest, patients refrain from abusive vocal behaviors to prevent further damage to the vocal folds from fibrosis and scarring. Duration ranges from one to several weeks depending on the problem and balancing other issues such as patient needing to use their voice for work.</p><p>Voice therapy involves teaching techniques to minimize harmful behaviors and altering voice production. One aim of therapy is to enable the patient to functionally adapt to laryngeal pathology that may be unalterable, such as vocal fold scarring. Voice therapy may be effective for select conditions such as vocal cord nodules and functional voice disorders.</p><p>Pharmacologic therapy includes antibiotics, glucocorticoids, mucolytics, antireflux medication, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs are usually used as ancillary therapy.</p><p>Surgical interventions include but are not limited to microlaryngoscopy with endolaryngeal excision, open neck procedures, and office-based procedures (eg, injections, laser treatments).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H292295011\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute laryngitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute laryngitis resolves without specific treatment other than hydration, humidification, and voice rest.</p><p>Antibiotics for acute laryngitis are usually unnecessary and may lead to bacterial resistance. A systematic review of studies evaluating antibiotics for acute laryngitis found only three randomized trials that met inclusion criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. One of these trials found no difference in time to voice recovery in patients randomly assigned to penicillin or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The second trial found no difference in objective voice scores between patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> or placebo; however, subjective reports of voice and cough improvement at one week favored erythromycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The third trial found that compared with no treatment, antibiotics (fusafungine or fusafungine plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>) improved clinical cure rates at 5 days, but not at 8 or 28 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. While antibiotic therapy may shorten the course of the voice complaints slightly, acute voice symptoms generally respond within one week regardless of therapy. Thus, antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear evidence of coexistent bacterial pharyngitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/3,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-streptococcal-pharyngitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of streptococcal pharyngitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Systemic glucocorticoids have a limited role in the treatment of acute laryngitis and should be reserved for patients who have a pressing need to use their voice (eg, professional speaking engagement or vocal performance). Although clinical experience suggests that the administration of steroids can lead to rapid resolution of vocal fold inflammation and an improvement in vocal quality, there are no randomized trials of steroid use for laryngitis in adults. Glucocorticoid use should be balanced by the adverse systemic effects of steroids, as well as the risk of masking underlying vocal fold pathology. If the performer strains an already compromised larynx, it can lead to vocal fold hemorrhage with the potential for permanent scarring and voice change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H292295032\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic laryngitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic laryngitis due to irritants generally resolves with removal of the offending agent.</p><p>Treatment of chronic laryngitis due to laryngopharyngeal reflux is discussed separately.

However, speech and swallowing therapy can be helpful by developing compensatory behaviors. In nerves that have sustained bruising or stretch injury without transection (neurapraxia), function generally returns within six months to one year. Laryngeal electromyography (EMG) can offer prognostic information regarding the likelihood of return of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hoarseness-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22653563\"><span class=\"h3\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No medications are used to treat vocal cord paralysis.
