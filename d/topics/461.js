Other issues related to airway management, including basic airway management, difficult airway assessment, and rapid sequence intubation, are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4248424390\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway management is an essential skill for clinicians caring for critically ill or injured patients and is fundamental to the practice of emergency medicine. In emergency medicine practice, rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the most frequently used and successful means of intubating the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. It is employed in approximately 70 to 85 percent of all patients requiring intubation in academic emergency departments, and about 82 percent of those without cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest patients, who are intubated without medications, comprise the bulk of the remaining patients.</p><p>Although RSI is generally the preferred approach in the emergency department (ED), it may be poorly suited for some patients with difficult airway attributes. Thus, a careful assessment for airway difficulty must precede the decision to use RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RSI AND THE DIFFICULT AIRWAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should employ an approach to emergency airway management that accounts for the possibility of difficult intubation, difficult bag-mask ventilation (BMV), difficult extraglottic device ventilation (EGV), and difficult cricothyroidotomy. Methods for evaluating airway difficulty and management of difficult and failed airways are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, RSI is used in patients for whom successful intubation and successful bag-mask ventilation are anticipated, despite any difficult airway attributes that may be identified. A significant number of ED patients in need of endotracheal intubation (ETI) have anatomic characteristics that can increase the procedure's difficulty. Nevertheless, the great majority of such patients can be managed using RSI.</p><p>No discreet threshold exists at which RSI is deemed safe or when it is contraindicated. This is due, in part, to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of commonly used guidelines for difficult airway prediction. The LEMON mnemonic is one aid for remembering important predictors of intubation difficulty, and has been prospectively validated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64336\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64336 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Difficult airway prediction guidelines are based primarily on the anesthesia experience, which often involves elective intubations of cooperative patients, and may not be applicable to the ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Furthermore, patients frequently present to the ED in extremis, and clinicians may be unable to obtain a history or to assess the airway adequately to determine whether a difficult intubation is likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Nevertheless, we suggest emergency clinicians assess any airway they may need to manage, to the extent possible given the constraints of time and patient cooperation, in order to be prepared for a potentially difficult airway.</p><p>Few studies have assessed difficult intubation in the ED and its true incidence is unknown. The difficult airway is likely more common among patients intubated in the ED than in the operating room, where patients are generally evaluated preoperatively and airway management can be done electively.</p><p>Part of the problem in determining the incidence of airway difficulty stems from the various ways of defining what constitutes a &quot;difficult airway&quot; or &quot;difficult intubation.&quot; Depending on the definition, estimates of the rate of difficult intubation in the ED range as high as 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Fortunately, intubation failure rates are much lower; cricothyroidotomy is performed in less than 1 percent of ED patients at major trauma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/3,7,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE MAIN AIRWAY ALGORITHM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The algorithms presented in this review were developed as part of a national airway training course and represent an initial approach to advanced emergency airway management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63518\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63518 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73509 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Once the need for intubation is decided, the clinician must determine the best approach. The following questions represent the major branch points in the main airway algorithm and reflect the important principles underlying advanced airway management:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient in arrest or an agonal state? If so, direct intubation without medications is appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73509 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'The crash airway algorithm'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the patient likely to respond to direct laryngoscopy (ie, gag, thrash, vomit)? If not, then the patient is unlikely to benefit from the time required to administer sedative and paralytic medications. Direct laryngoscopy, without medications, is indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73509 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'The crash airway algorithm'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One exception to this recommendation is the patient who is unresponsive because of a critical intracranial insult (eg, intracranial hemorrhage). In such patients RSI provides superior control of adverse reflexes that may increase intracranial pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Head injury or stroke'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is not in arrest or an agonal state, is a difficult airway predicted? The goal is to identify characteristics likely to result in significantly difficult intubation or ventilation. In such cases, it is prudent to choose an intubation technique that allows the patient to maintain spontaneous respirations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58510\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef58510 \">algorithm 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As long as oxygenation is adequate and no significant difficulty with intubation or ventilation is anticipated, rapid sequence intubation using direct laryngoscopy is advised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If intubation was attempted but unsuccessful, is oxygenation adequate (ie, pulse oximetry above 90 percent)? If not, and if oxygenation does not immediately improve with better bag-mask ventilation, then a failed airway exists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73112\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73112 \">algorithm 4</a>). In most circumstances, a patient who is unable to be intubated and cannot be ventilated will require a surgical airway (ie, cricothyroidotomy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If intubation is unsuccessful despite three attempts by an experienced operator, regardless of the ability to oxygenate, this too constitutes a failed airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">THE CRASH AIRWAY ALGORITHM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The crash approach is predicated on the need for immediate airway control in the unresponsive patient unlikely to benefit from medications. The &quot;crash&quot; patient is unconscious, unresponsive, and has absent or severely compromised cardiopulmonary function. The assumption is that the patient is relaxed and unresponsive, similar to the conditions achieved with RSI. The following questions represent the major branch points in the crash airway algorithm and reflect the important principles underlying crash airway management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73509 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/advanced-emergency-airway-management-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If intubation is attempted but unsuccessful, can oxygenation be maintained adequately with a bag and mask? This often cannot be determined by pulse oximetry, because the patient may not have a pulse oximetry waveform. Instead, the provider must rely on assessment of chest rise, mask seal, and bag compliance to determine the adequacy of bag-mask ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If attempts at oxygenation are ineffective then a failed airway exists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If oxygenation is judged effective after the failed intubation attempt, then a single dose of a muscular relaxing agent is administered before subsequent intubation attempts. In the absence of contraindications, high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> is useful to overcome residual muscular rigidity. The higher dose is recommended to increase the speed of onset in patients with severe circulatory compromise. If succinylcholine is felt to be contraindicated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a> at a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> can be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If intubation is unsuccessful despite three attempts by an experienced operator then a failed airway exists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend rapid sequence intubation (RSI) for emergency intubations when significant intubation difficulty is not anticipated and a crash airway scenario does not exist.
