It occurs in epidemics nearly every year, mainly during the winter season in temperate climates. Influenza viruses change their antigenic characteristics frequently, and their subsequent spread depends upon the susceptibility of the population to viruses with novel antigens. Annual influenza vaccination is an important public health measure for preventing influenza infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The protection provided by influenza vaccines is based upon induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies, mainly against the viral hemagglutinin.</p><p>The role of influenza vaccination in the prevention of seasonal influenza will be reviewed here. The use of influenza vaccine in immunocompromised hosts, pregnant women, patients with chronic liver disease, patients with end-stage renal disease, healthcare workers, and travelers is discussed separately. (See associated topic reviews.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of influenza in adults, the role of antiviral agents for the prevention and treatment of seasonal influenza, and vaccines against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza (&quot;swine influenza&quot;) virus, H5N1 avian influenza, and H7N9 avian influenza are also reviewed elsewhere.

Surveillance information, which is updated weekly during influenza season, is available on the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsdMegrjUojmhN4YaPOKVJCXGOZTi7xPjUfp8FmJD2sNk&amp;TOPIC_ID=7007\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC website</a>.

High-risk individuals, their close contacts, and healthcare workers should remain high-priority recipients in vaccination campaigns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79334\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79334 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H775072460\" class=\"local\">'High-priority groups'</a> below.)</p><p>Older adults and individuals with underlying health problems are at increased risk for complications of influenza, including death. Influenza vaccination not only reduces the risk of influenza infection but also reduces the severity of illness in those who are infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Influenza virus usually causes an acute self-limited febrile illness in healthy young adults; vaccination results in fewer influenza infections and fewer missed days from work in such individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Widespread immunization of children has appeared to result in herd immunity, with a reduction in influenza infections in unvaccinated children and adults of all ages.

As a consequence, new vaccines are produced each year to match circulating viruses. Currently, vaccine production takes, on average, six months from the selection of seed strains to the final vaccine product. The decision of which influenza antigens to include in the vaccines is made in advance of the influenza season and is based upon global surveillance of influenza viruses circulating at the end of the prior influenza season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As a result, rarely there are mismatches between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain that result in reduced efficacy of the vaccine.</p><p>Current influenza vaccines are trivalent or quadrivalent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79474 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

For trivalent vaccines, the influenza B antigen also changed.</p><p>Influenza A viruses, in particular, undergo periodic changes in the antigenic characteristics of their envelope glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among the large number of influenza A viruses that infect mammals, three major subtypes of hemagglutinins (H1, H2, and H3) and two subtypes of neuraminidases (N1 and N2) have commonly caused disease in humans; other subtypes have caused sporadic infections (eg, H5N1, H7N9). Major changes in these glycoproteins are referred to as antigenic shifts, and minor changes are called antigenic drifts. Antigenic shifts are generally associated with pandemics of influenza A. Antigenic drifts are associated with the usual annual epidemics and necessitate annual updating of the vaccine antigen makeup. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-influenza#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of influenza&quot;, section on 'Antigenic shifts'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-influenza#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of influenza&quot;, section on 'Antigenic drifts'</a>.)</p><p>Influenza B viruses have a lesser propensity for antigenic changes, and only antigenic drifts in the hemagglutinin have been described. More subtypes of hemagglutinins and neuraminidases can exist in avian influenza A viruses compared with the influenza A viruses that cause seasonal influenza infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-pathogenesis-of-avian-influenza#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and pathogenesis of avian influenza&quot;, section on 'Background'</a>.)</p><p>Two genetic lineages of influenza B viruses have circulated since the mid-1980s. The potential benefit of using a quadrivalent vaccine is illustrated by a report showing that, during 12 seasonal influenza outbreaks between 1999 and 2012, 42 percent of all influenza B infections were caused by viruses of the genetic lineage that was not included in the trivalent vaccine used during those seasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Influenza B viruses accounted for 26 percent of all typed viruses.</p><p>The current vaccination strategy is vulnerable to the emergence of epidemic or pandemic strains that are not represented in the current vaccine. Ongoing research is focused on developing a universal vaccine that would elicit protective antibodies directed against conserved viral proteins.

The protective efficacy of the vaccine is largely determined by the relationship (closeness of &quot;fit&quot; or &quot;match&quot;) between the strains in the vaccine and viruses that circulate in the outbreak. A study that compared the effectiveness of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> during influenza seasons with differing degrees of vaccine match illustrates the importance of the fit between circulating influenza virus strains and the vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. During the 2004 to 2005 influenza season, the antigenic match was only 5 percent compared with 91 percent during the 2006 to 2007 season, which resulted in a vaccine effectiveness of 10 versus 52 percent, respectively. During the 2014 to 2015 influenza season in the United States, influenza A H3N2 viruses predominated and more than half of these viruses contained H3N2 antigen that was antigenically different (drifted) from that included in that season's influenza vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

In a 2012 meta-analysis (performed by the same group that did the comprehensive review) that included eight randomized trials of the inactivated influenza vaccines in adults aged 18 to 64 years over nine influenza seasons, vaccine efficacy for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza was 59 percent (95% CI 51 to 67 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Of note, higher rates of efficacy and effectiveness have been reported in trials that used serologic endpoints; such trials were excluded from this meta-analysis because using serologic endpoints is likely to lead to an overestimation of benefit.</p><p>In a 2014 meta-analysis of randomized trials and observational studies of healthy adults, the overall efficacy of inactivated vaccines in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza was 60 percent (53 to 66 percent), corresponding to a number needed to vaccinate (NNV) of 71 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The overall effectiveness of inactivated vaccine against influenza-like illness was 16 percent (95% CI 5 to 25 percent), corresponding to a NNV of 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The difference between these two results relates to the different incidence of these endpoints among the study populations; 2.4 percent of unvaccinated individuals versus 1.1 percent of vaccinated individuals developed laboratory-confirmed influenza, whereas 15.6 percent of unvaccinated individuals versus 9.9 percent of vaccinated individuals developed an influenza-like illness, respectively. The discrepancy between protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness is likely related to the well-known lack of protection offered by influenza vaccines against non-influenza respiratory viruses.</p><p>The match between the antigens included in the influenza vaccines and circulating influenza strains would be expected to have an important influence on the efficacy of the vaccines. In the 2014 meta-analysis described above, inactivated vaccines were 16 percent effective (95% CI 9 to 23 percent) in preventing influenza-like illness when strains contained in the vaccine antigenically matched circulating strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. On the other hand, inactivated vaccines were not protective against influenza-like illness when the degree of matching between the vaccine and circulating influenza strains was absent or unknown. In contrast, the efficacy of inactivated vaccines for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza was similar when the match was good and when the match was absent or unknown (62 versus 55 percent, respectively).</p><p>Several studies have shown that influenza vaccination is less effective in individuals who were vaccinated during the current and previous season(s) compared with individuals who were vaccinated during the current season only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/49-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-55</a>].

In a large surveillance study from 2010 to 2015, vaccination in two consecutive seasons was more effective in preventing hospitalization for confirmed influenza than vaccination in either season alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>One study has supported the antigenic distance hypothesis to explain the finding of reduced vaccine efficacy in those who were vaccinated during the current and previous season; this hypothesis predicts that negative interference from the prior season's influenza vaccine on the current season's vaccine protection may occur when the antigenic distance is small between the prior and current season's vaccines but large between the prior season's vaccine and the current epidemic strain of influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Nevertheless, annual vaccination continues to be recommended because annual vaccination is required to protect against newly circulating influenza strains included in the current year's vaccine and because vaccinating the population is likely to provide benefit even if the vaccine has reduced efficacy in those who are vaccinated annually. In an analysis of a hypothetical cohort, over a two-year period, the highest number of cases will occur in the population that remains unvaccinated; a single vaccination is better than no vaccination, and vaccination in both years is likely to prevent more disease than vaccination in a single year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

In a case-control study in which hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection were matched against outpatients with laboratory-confirmed influenza and outpatient controls, vaccine effectiveness was 75 percent for preventing outpatient influenza cases, 60 percent for preventing influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 89 percent for preventing severe influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This study found that influenza vaccination did not reduce the risk of pneumonia (including those who did not require hospitalization), after adjusting for the presence and severity of comorbidities. In contrast, in a 2012 cohort study of community-dwelling older individuals that evaluated 12.6 million person-influenza seasons, vaccination was associated with a reduction in the composite endpoint of hospitalization (for pneumonia and influenza) and death during influenza season (aOR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.92) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. A case-control study also showed that influenza vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization due to laboratory-confirmed influenza among adults aged &ge;50 years of age regardless of age group (50 to &lt;65 years; 65 to &lt;75 years; &ge;75 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

In a modeling study, during the 2012 to 2013 influenza season (a moderate to severe season), among individuals &ge;65 years of age in the United States, a vaccine with 10 percent effectiveness and 66 percent coverage would have averted approximately 13,000 hospitalizations and a vaccine with 40 percent effectiveness would have averted approximately 60,000 hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. In a population-based study in the United States that assessed the effect of influenza vaccination on disease severity among hospitalized patients &ge;65 years of age during the 2013 to 2014 influenza season, a season in which vaccine viruses were antigenically similar to circulating viruses, influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk of ICU admission and in-hospital mortality as well as reduced ICU and hospital length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Since protection against influenza is suboptimal in older adults, it is not surprising that the outbreaks of influenza have occurred in nursing homes where 80 to 98 percent of residents were vaccinated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>Vaccinating younger adults appears to provide benefit for older adults in the same community.

The mortality rate was 0.028 per 10,000 person-weeks for the high-dose vaccine compared with 0.038 per 10,000 person-weeks for the standard-dose vaccine; overall CE was 24 percent (95% CI 0.6 to 42 percent). The high-dose vaccine was more effective than the standard-dose vaccine for preventing postinfluenza death during the 2012 to 2013 influenza season (36.4 percent CE, 95% CI 9 to 56 percent), a season when circulation of H3N2 influenza A (a strain associated with severe disease) was common. In contrast, it was not more effective for preventing postinfluenza death during the following season (2.5 percent CE, 95% CI -47 to 35 percent), when H1N1 influenza A (a strain associated with mild disease) predominated. It is likely that the difference between the results for the two seasons was due to the fact that it is difficult to demonstrate benefit during a mild influenza season, when death is a rare outcome. The high-dose vaccine was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization during both seasons (2012 to 2013 CE 22.1 percent, 95% CI 16.6 to 27.3 percent; 2013 to 2014 CE 12.7 percent, 95% CI 4.9 to 19.9 percent).</p><p>In a cluster-randomized trial that compared the high-dose vaccine to the standard-dose vaccine in nursing home residents &ge;65 years of age in 823 nursing homes in the United States, the incidence of respiratory-related hospital admissions was lower in facilities where residents received high-dose vaccine than in those where residents received standard-dose vaccine (adjusted relative risk 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p>Further, in a large retrospective cohort study of United States Medicare beneficiaries &ge;65 years of age, receipt of the high-dose vaccine was associated with reduced rates of probable influenza infection and hospital admission for influenza compared with standard-dose vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].

However, a 2008 literature review that included studies of individuals &gt;60 years old found that, after influenza vaccination, seroprotection was maintained for at least four months (and often for longer) in all eight studies that assessed antibody responses to the H3N2 component and in five of seven studies that assessed responses to the H1N1 and B components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. Following successful immunization, seroprotection rates of 70 to 100 percent were maintained not just at four months (two studies) but also at five months (two studies) and at &gt;6 months (four studies) for the H3N2 and H1N1 influenza A vaccine components. Seroprotection rates were less consistent for the influenza B vaccine component. Both studies that failed the criteria for seroprotection at four or more months following immunization for the H1N1 influenza A and influenza B components also reported failed seroprotection at one month following immunization. This suggests that patients who did not have seroprotective antibodies at four months failed to mount an adequate immune response following vaccination (as opposed to having developed seroprotective antibodies following vaccination that subsequently waned).</p><p>A subsequent study showed a decline in antibody titers six months after vaccination in individuals &ge;65 years of age, although the titers still met the levels considered adequate for protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].

Vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza infection was 61 percent (95% CI 5 to 84 percent) during the first 100 days after vaccination, 42 percent (95% CI -39 to 75 percent) between 100 and 119 days, and 0 thereafter.</p><p>In a study of children and adults (most of whom were &lt;65 years of age) with medically attended acute respiratory illness during four influenza seasons, decreased influenza vaccine effectiveness was associated with time since vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>]. Maximum vaccine effectiveness was observed at 14 days following vaccination, followed by an estimated decline of about 7 percent per month for H3N2 influenza A and influenza B and 6 to 11 percent per month for H1N1 influenza A.

Non-egg-based methods are attractive because they are less laborious, have a shorter production time, and do not depend on a supply of eggs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/66,127,157\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,127,157</a>]. As noted above, two vaccine formulations not produced in eggs are available (Flucelvax and Flublok).

Cell-based vaccines may also induce broader immune responses, which might provide better protection against variant strains. Mammalian cells are also more permissive of influenza virus replication; certain influenza viruses, such as avian H5N1 viruses, do not replicate well in eggs.</p><p>There has also been interest in a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector-based influenza vaccine because it induces an influenza virus-specific T cell response. In a small study, an MVA vector-based vaccine was safe and immunogenic in healthy individuals and appeared to reduce the incidence of influenza infection following an intranasal challenge compared with unvaccinated individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]. Among vaccinees who developed influenza infection, influenza symptoms were less pronounced and the duration of viral shedding was shorter than in unvaccinated individuals.</p><p>Additional vaccines that are being evaluated employ other viral vectors (eg, vaccinia virus, adenoviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus) or utilize virus-like particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. A vaccine that uses recombinant DNA technology and a baculovirus expression system to produce virus-like particles (Flublok) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Such a vaccine would provide protection against drifting influenza strains as well as against newly emerging pandemic strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. In addition, a universal vaccine might also decrease the emergence of viral escape mutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. Promising targets include the highly conserved external domain of the influenza matrix 2 protein and conserved epitopes from the influenza nucleoprotein, matrix 1 protein, and hemagglutinin protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p>Although most influenza vaccines have been designed to elicit a humoral immune response, in a phase I clinical trial, a modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector that encodes the influenza nucleoprotein and matrix 1 protein boosted T cell responses, particularly CD8+ T cell responses, to all influenza A subtypes in healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. Such a vaccine has the benefit of being directed at epitopes within the conserved internal proteins of influenza viruses rather than at the highly variable surface proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>].</p><p>Most neutralizing antibody responses in individuals who were infected with the H1N1 influenza A strain that caused the 2009 to 2010 pandemic were broadly cross-reactive against epitopes in the hemagglutinin stalk and head domain of multiple influenza strains, suggesting that a universal influenza vaccine might be developed using such immunogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>]. In one study, influenza B infection with either of two strains induced antibodies specific to the HA head and stalk, but only HA stalk-specific antibodies mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity efficiently and displayed cross-reactivity with influenza B virus of both lineages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78880699\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced-dose vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccine shortages have occurred in some seasons. One approach to address this involves giving a reduced dose of vaccine in order to expand the available supply. In a trial of half- versus full-dose trivalent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> among healthy individuals who had previously been vaccinated, both doses led to equivalent protective hemagglutination titers (&ge;1:40) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>]. However, geometric mean titers (GMTs) were slightly lower for all vaccine strains among those who received the reduced dose. Among women 18 to 49 years of age who received the half-dose vaccine, titers were equal or higher than in men who received the full-dose vaccine. Some subjects 50 to 64 years of age who received the half-dose vaccine had GMTs that were unacceptably low. These findings suggest that, in the presence of a vaccine shortage, administering half-dose vaccine to targeted individuals (healthy women between the ages of 18 to 49 who have been vaccinated in previous years) might be an effective strategy.</p><p>Using a reduced dose of vaccine by the intradermal route has also been evaluated in several studies, as discussed above.

It occurs in epidemics nearly every year, mainly during the winter season in temperate climates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60877\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60877 \">figure 1</a>). Influenza virus is remarkable for its high rate of mutation; this viral evolution compromises the ability of the immune system to protect against new viral variants. As a consequence, new vaccines are produced each year to match the vaccine with the new circulating viruses. The protective efficacy of the vaccine is largely determined by the relationship (closeness of &quot;fit&quot; or &quot;match&quot;) between the strains in the vaccine and viruses that circulate in the outbreak. Annual influenza vaccination is an important public health measure for preventing influenza infection. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antigenic composition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several influenza vaccines are licensed for use in the United States, including inactivated vaccines, which are administered intramuscularly or intradermally, and a live attenuated vaccine, which is administered intranasally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79474 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60449 \">table 3</a>). Current influenza vaccines are trivalent or quadrivalent. The protection provided by influenza vaccines is based upon induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies, mainly directed against the viral hemagglutinin. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Vaccine formulations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends influenza vaccination for all individuals six months of age and older. High-risk individuals, their close contacts, and healthcare workers should remain high-priority populations in vaccination campaigns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79334\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79334 \">table 1</a>).

For individuals &ge;65 years of age and for other individuals at increased risk for severe influenza (eg, immunocompromise; chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disease; pregnancy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72029\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72029 \">table 4</a>), we also recommend annual influenza vaccination (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H766698187\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single dose of an influenza vaccine should be offered soon after the vaccine becomes available, ideally by October in the northern hemisphere and May in the southern hemisphere. Annual immunization is necessary even if the previous year's vaccine contained one or more of the antigens to be administered because immunity declines during the year following vaccination. (See <a href=\"#H775052810\" class=\"local\">'Schedule'</a> above and <a href=\"#H775055218\" class=\"local\">'Need for annual vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of vaccine formulation depends upon several factors, including age, comorbidities, and risk of adverse reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79474 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60449 \">table 3</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For individuals between 18 and 64 years of age, we suggest a standard-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> rather than the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-live-attenuated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">live attenuated influenza vaccine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We favor a quadrivalent formulation of the inactivated vaccine over a trivalent formulation when possible. Other options are discussed above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For individuals &ge;65 years of age, we recommend the high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> (Fluzone High-Dose) when available rather than a standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine because the high-dose vaccine is more immunogenic and effective than the standard-dose vaccine in such patients (including a mortality benefit) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). An alternative is the quadrivalent recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent), which is more effective than the standard-dose inactivated vaccine for preventing influenza but which has not been compared directly to the high-dose inactivated vaccine. An adjuvanted vaccine is also considered an option for this age group by the ACIP, but we do not favor it, as there are no reported clinical efficacy trials of this vaccine in older adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Additional guidance regarding the most appropriate formulation for a given patient is provided above.
