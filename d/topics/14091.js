They also removed massive proteinuria (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/24</span> hours) and fetal growth restriction as possible features of severe disease because massive proteinuria has a poor correlation with outcome, and fetal growth restriction is managed similarly whether or not preeclampsia is diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

One theory is that the immune system of nulliparous women has had limited exposure to paternal antigens, and this lack of desensitization may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Epidemiologic data support this theory: Protection from preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies is either reduced or eliminated if there is a change in paternity, women using barrier methods of contraception are at increased risk, and risk is reduced with increased duration of sexual activity before pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

This appears to alter placental villous angiogenesis, leading to poor development of the fetoplacental vasculature and abnormal vascular reactivity.

Whether sitting or in semi-Fowler, the arm should be supported and at heart level.

One particular scenario that is clinically challenging is determining whether a woman with signs of preeclampsia, such as an increase in blood pressure or a slightly elevated level of urinary protein, requires medical intervention, such as hospitalization or even delivery. A biomarker test that improved our ability to predict patients who require or do not require a higher degree of medical intervention would be helpful.</p><p>A prospective, multicenter, international observational study (PROGNOSIS) attempted to derive and validate a serum sFlt-1:PlGF ratio that would predict the absence or presence of preeclampsia in the short term in women who already had signs suggestive of preeclampsia, such as an increase in blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The study included 500 women with singleton pregnancies at 24 to 36+6 weeks of gestation with suspected preeclampsia based on one or more of the following: new increase in blood pressure but less than <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg, new proteinuria but less than 2+ dipstick, preeclampsia-related laboratory findings but not meeting criteria for HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), preeclampsia-related symptoms (edema, headache, visual changes, sudden weight gain). Although the authors concluded that an sFlt-1:PlGF ratio cutoff of 38 or lower using a specific automated commercial assay had a negative predictive value (no preeclampsia in the next seven days) of 99.3 percent (95% CI 97.9-99.9), with sensitivity of 80 percent (95% CI 51.9-95.7) and specificity of 78.3 percent (95% CI 74.6-81.7), we question the clinical usefulness of this conclusion since the women enrolled in the study appeared to have a clinical profile of mild disease and the prevalence of preeclampsia was quite low in this group. The positive predictive value of a ratio above 38 for the diagnosis of preeclampsia within four weeks was only 36.7 percent in the next four weeks (95% CI 28.4-45.7) with a sensitivity of 66.2 percent (95% CI, 54.0-77.0) and specificity of 83.1 percent (95% CI, 79.4-86.3). Whether this ratio will be helpful in reducing iatrogenic morbidity due to overdiagnosis in women with suggestive signs of preeclampsia is unclear. Further exploration of this test is warranted, including determining whether the cut-off varies among laboratories and patient populations, the best interval for repeat testing, and how this information affects clinical outcomes and costs.

Preeclampsia does not affect the myocardium directly, but the heart responds to physiological changes induced by the disease.
