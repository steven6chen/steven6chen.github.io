It used to be called &quot;juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.&quot; Arthritis is a medical term for inflammation of the joints.</p><p>There are several different types of this condition. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic arthritis &ndash; This type happens when the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system,&quot; attacks the joints. It also causes a fever and rash. Children age 1 to 16 years can get systemic arthritis. It is just as common in boys as in girls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyarthritis &ndash; This type affects more than 4 joints after the child has it for 6 months. It is more common in girls than in boys. It is also called &quot;polyarticular arthritis.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligoarthritis &ndash; This type affects less than 5 different joints after the child has it for 6 months. It is the most common type of juvenile arthritis. About half of children who have juvenile arthritis have this type. It is more common in girls, and usually starts at age 2 to 3 years. Children 10 years and older rarely get it. It is also called &quot;oligoarticular arthritis&quot; or &quot;pauciarthritis.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enthesitis-related arthritis &ndash; This type of arthritis most often affects the leg and back joints. It usually starts later in childhood. It is more common in boys than in girls. It is also called &quot;spondyloarthropathy&quot; or &quot;spondyloarthritis.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psoriatic arthritis &ndash; This type affects one to many joints. It also causes a rash and nail changes. Patients can have sausage-like swelling of fingers or toes (doctors call this &quot;dactylitis&quot;). It is more common in girls than boys. It is rare in children under 1 year of age.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200791\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; Children who have systemic arthritis sometimes get a fever at the same time every day for 2 weeks or more. The fever can go away but come back around the same time the next day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash &ndash; Children who have systemic arthritis sometimes get a rash. The rash is made up of small pink patches. It can be easy to see when the child has a fever. The rash might go away when the fever goes down and start again when the fever comes back.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The joint symptoms happen in all types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common joints affected are the wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles. The arthritis can also be in the hands, hips, back, and jaw.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arthritis sometimes happens in the same joint on both sides of the body. For example, it might happen in both knees or both wrists.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some children have a stiff or swollen joint that does not hurt. For example, a child might &quot;walk funny&quot; in the morning, but get better after a little while.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200806\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child has a stiff, swollen, or painful joint, see a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200821\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask about your child's symptoms. Many other conditions cause symptoms similar to juvenile idiopathic arthritis. These include infections, cancer, and other diseases. The doctor or nurse can order blood tests to see your child has a different condition.</p><p>Some children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis get an eye disease called &quot;uveitis.&quot; This is an inflammation inside the eye. Often, uveitis does not cause symptoms until it has damaged the eye. A child who has juvenile idiopathic arthritis might need to see an eye doctor to check for uveitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200838\"><span class=\"h1\">How is juvenile idiopathic arthritis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Doctors use several different medicines to treat arthritis in children. These can help joint pain and stiffness. They can also treat fever, rash, and other symptoms. Medicines can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines called NSAIDs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other medicines that come in pills</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines given as a shot into joints</p><p/><p>Doctors might also recommend:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy, if the arthritis causes muscle problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat problems caused by the arthritis, such as uveitis or growth problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to fix problems caused by the arthritis, such as having one leg that is longer than the other</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27200853\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uveitis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
