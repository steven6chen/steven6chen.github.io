Cure rates have risen, largely due to the use of combined modality therapy in trials conducted by large international cooperative groups, such as the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG), which is now known as the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group (COG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of treatment for RMS.

In contrast, with the use of modern combined modality therapy, over 70 percent of children with localized RMS can be cured of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].</p><p>These improved outcomes are the direct result of multimodality therapeutic protocols that have been developed by large international cooperative groups, such as the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG, now the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group [COG]). Modern treatment for RMS includes chemotherapy for primary cytoreduction and eradication of both macroscopic and microscopic metastatic disease; surgery, if feasible; and radiation therapy (RT) to control microscopic local residual disease.</p><p>The specific treatment regimen depends on the estimated risk of a disease recurrence, which is based upon a variety of clinicopathologic prognostic factors that have been identified through a series of treatment protocols carried out by the IRSG. This is termed risk-adapted therapy. The most recent risk stratification schema is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>However, readers should be aware that some more recent and current COG protocols (eg, ARST0431 and ARST1431; see below for detail) have defined intermediate-risk and high-risk treatment groups that were designed specifically for the actual protocol and do not reflect these definitions. This can be confusing, but in this chapter, we aim to describe treatment guidelines based upon the established historical definition of &quot;risk group,&quot; as defined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404 \">table 1</a>), and not the risk groups defined in individual protocols.

These studies have been instrumental in identifying prognostic factors, developing risk-based therapies, and improving outcomes for RMS. The group's success is reflected in dramatic increases in the overall five-year survival rates for patients with RMS, from 55 percent in IRS-I to 63 percent in IRS-II to approximately 71 percent in the IRS-III and IRS-IV protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>All of these studies enrolled all stages of disease, but separate protocols were carried out for completely resected localized disease, incompletely resected localized disease, and regionally <span class=\"nowrap\">advanced/distant</span> disease. The most important findings of these studies, which have formed the basis for risk-adapted therapy, can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extent of surgical resection (ie, the clinical group [CG] classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59875 \">table 2</a>)) correlated with outcome in IRS-I, II, and III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. In IRS-III, for example, patients with completely resected RMS (CG I) had a five-year survival rate of over 90 percent, as compared with 80, 70, and 30 percent for those with CG II, III, and IV disease, respectively. For CG III patients (gross residual disease after surgery), neither a higher total dose of RT nor the use of accelerated fractionation RT improved local control or survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and staging&quot;, section on 'Clinical group'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62717 \">table 3</a>) was prospectively implemented in IRS-III after it was validated using data from IRS-II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/8,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14,15</a>]. For IRS-IV, TNM stage was used to assign chemotherapy treatment, while CG was used to select patients for RT. In subsequent studies (eg, IRS-V), a combined prognostic stratification scheme was used to assign all therapeutic modalities based upon estimated prognosis (ie, risk-adapted therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Options for standard treatment based upon risk group designation are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53178\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53178 \">table 4</a>). These include two or three drug regimens (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dactinomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dactinomycin</a> [VA] or VA combined with reduced cumulative dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> [VAC]) for patients with low-risk tumors at sites such as the orbit, paratesticular sites, and the head and neck (nonparameningeal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. For others, a three-drug regimen (VAC with a higher cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide) or a four-drug regimen adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> to VAC is needed. The addition of other individually active agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>) has not been shown to improve outcome in any patient subgroup. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> below.) </p><p/><p>The following sections provide an overview of standard treatment recommendations for RMS, which are based mainly upon the results of the last third-generation protocols (IRS-IV, the D series studies of IRS-V, and all of the COG-era ARST protocols).</p><p>An important point is that treatment for RMS is constantly evolving, and if the reader's goal is to obtain information on how to treat a specific patient, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> should contact a pediatric oncologist who is a member of the <a href=\"https://childrensoncologygroup.org/index.php/locations&amp;token=vFP2bi1C0IlZWM954cffIHL2Okd0SghVrE1h0t4VNmicdQlQGpoazJ2xrNJvjqcme0GjOXZsNdKIr2nrbdcSug==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7721\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">COG</a> and who has expertise in soft tissue sarcoma for the latest recommendation. All eligible patients with RMS should be enrolled in one of the active clinical research protocols in any part of the world. In the United States, these are designed by the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the COG and administered by COG centers according to risk groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404 \">table 1</a>). For current open protocols, a member center should be contacted. Although in the United States pediatric oncologists treat patients up to the age of 20, any patient younger than 50 years old is eligible for these protocols.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend complete excision for localized disease as long as functional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cosmetic results are acceptable. If complete resection is not feasible or if disease involves the orbit, vagina, bladder, or biliary tract, patients are better approached with an initial diagnostic biopsy followed by induction (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and then definitive local therapy with either surgery or RT. For disease at any primary site, palpable or radiologically enlarged lymph nodes should be excised and submitted for histologic evaluation, regardless of positron emission tomography (PET) avidity. The necessity of routine surgical sampling of nonsuspicious lymph nodes depends on the primary site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Head and neck</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary head and neck tumors are rarely amenable to wide local excision because of proximity to vital structures and cosmetic concerns. This generally limits the role of surgery to initial diagnostic biopsy. However, the availability of highly skilled otolaryngologic and craniofacial reconstructive teams at selected institutions may permit resection of some tumors that would otherwise be considered unresectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Because of the low incidence of locoregional node involvement (approximately 20 percent, no different from other sites except for the orbit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]), routine cervical lymph node sampling is unnecessary. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-sarcomas#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Rhabdomyosarcoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Paratesticular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paratesticular tumors should be removed via radical inguinal orchiectomy and resection of the entire spermatic cord. As with testicular germ cell tumors, a transscrotal surgical approach is specifically contraindicated in order to avoid scrotal contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-inguinal-orchiectomy-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical inguinal orchiectomy for testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All boys 10 years of age or older who have a paratesticular RMS should undergo routine ipsilateral nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). The rationale for this recommendation is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, approximately 14 percent of boys with paratesticular RMS without radiographic lymph node enlargement will be found to harbor metastases; the risk is much higher (47 percent) among adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In IRS-III, RPLND was recommended, and only 2 of the 11 failures (18 percent) were regional. In contrast, routine RPLND was not used in IRS-IV, and 7 of the total 16 failures (43 percent) were nodal. For patients over the age of 10 who had CG I paratesticular RMS and only received VA, the three-year failure-free survival (FFS, defined as the time from therapy initiation to disease progression, recurrence, or death from any cause) rate was significantly worse than that for younger boys with CG II disease (68 versus 100 percent) who were treated with intensive chemotherapy and RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The histopathologic documentation of nodal metastases is clinically important because patients with positive nodes are referred for postoperative RT as well as three-drug (VAC) chemotherapy, while both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and RT can be withheld in those with negative nodes; FFS in these adequately staged patients is 100 percent.</p><p/><p>For younger boys (under the age of 10), surgical excision of radiographically enlarged lymph nodes is warranted, but RPLND is not indicated in the absence of suspicious radiographic findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Other genitourinary tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The functional morbidity of initial surgery for other genitourinary tract tumors has prompted the avoidance of upfront surgery in favor of multimodality approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Vulvar, vaginal, uterine, bladder, and prostatic RMS usually respond well enough to induction chemotherapy to render them locally resectable, often with negative resection margins for tumor involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].</p><p>One possible exception is a tumor arising in the dome of the bladder, for which partial cystectomy may be performed before chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The benefit and timing of RT in this setting are controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Extremity and trunk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite advances in therapy, outcome for children with an extremity RMS is inferior to that of more favorable sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/5,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29</a>]. Initial resection of a localized extremity RMS should be attempted as long as limb function is not compromised; outcomes are significantly worse if gross residual disease remains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In all cases, patients with extremity RMS should undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. If the sentinel node(s) <span class=\"nowrap\">is/are</span> positive by histopathological evaluation, assessment of more-proximal lymph node levels in the chain of lymphatic drainage should be considered. Routine ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy is also recommended for perineal or anal RMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Attempted resection is also appropriate for truncal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Similar to extremity tumors, tumors involving the chest wall appear to do worse after wide surgical excision if the margins are not negative for tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/19,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,36</a>].

A multidisciplinary discussion among the surgeon, radiation oncologist, pediatric oncologist, and the parents should take place after chemotherapy in all patients with CG III disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59875 \">table 2</a>) regarding the risks and potential benefits involved in a second-look surgery. The main benefit of second-look surgery in this setting is to identify patients who may benefit from reduced-dose RT.</p><p>For patients with a clinical (radiographically) complete response to induction chemotherapy, second-look surgery has been studied as a means of documenting the histopathologic response in an attempt to improve outcomes. However, a survival benefit from this approach has not been proven. A lack of correlation between radiographic tumor response to induction therapy and overall prognosis was shown in the IRS-IV trial, in which CG III participants who completed all protocol therapy without developing progressive disease were assessed for response (complete response, partial response [&ge;50 percent decrease], or no response [&lt;50 percent decrease and &lt;25 percent increase]) by radiographic measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. When categorized as to the best response to therapy, five-year FFS was similar for participants achieving a clinical complete response and for those whose best response was a partial response or no response (80 versus 78 percent). Among the 17 participants with a best response of <span class=\"nowrap\">partial/no</span> response who had second-look surgical procedures, 8 (50 percent) of 16 with available pathology reports had residual viable tumors, and resection did not improve outcomes (see below).</p><p>However, it should be noted that in other studies, such as the Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) RMS trials, partial response (&gt;33 percent reduction in tumor size) or an objective response of a lesser magnitude (&lt;33 percent reduction in tumor size) after three cycles of chemotherapy has been correlated with better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Additional data examining the value of second-look surgery come from the International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) Malignant Mesenchymal Tumors study, in which 237 patients with nonparameningeal RMS underwent initial biopsy or limited surgery, followed by three to six cycles of chemotherapy and a second-look surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. RT was withheld in patients with a histopathologic complete response. Unfortunately, 50 percent of patients ultimately had a local recurrence, regardless of whether they underwent second-look surgery or were followed clinically.</p><p>This approach was also evaluated in the IRS-III study, in which patients with CG III disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59875 \">table 2</a>) underwent induction chemotherapy and local RT; some patients underwent second-look surgery, which was delayed until 20 weeks after therapy initiation, when possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The goal was to render the patients tumor free by week 20. The following results were noted in a subset of 111 patients with pelvic tumors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty-seven patients had a clinical complete response, 55 patients had a partial response, and there were 29 patients with minor responses (objective tumor regression of less than 50 percent of baseline tumor size).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 55 patients who had a partial response undergoing second-look surgery, 14 (25 percent) were in fact histopathologic complete responses and an additional 12 (22 percent) were rendered tumor free by surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five of 29 patients with a minor response were found to have histopathologic complete responses, while seven others were converted to a histopathologic complete response as a result of surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite these benefits, the lack of randomized studies precludes any conclusions as to the survival benefit of second-look surgery to resect residual disease.</p><p/><p>The survival impact of a second-look surgical procedure during treatment was also addressed in an analysis of a subset of patients who participated in IRS-IV and who underwent a second-look procedure before the completion of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The initial protocol had stipulated that a second-look procedure be considered for patients who still had a persistent tumor mass at week 46 or 47, approximately four weeks after completing treatment. Despite this, 79 children had a second-look procedure prior to completing chemotherapy.

Historically, for patients with parameningeal tumors and intracranial extension or cranial nerve palsies, radiation was initiated emergently on day 0. However, more recent limited data suggest that there is no benefit for early RT when intensive chemotherapy is used and that the functional and survival outcomes are similar if RT is delivered after four cycles of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. There are now many centers, including ours, recommending RT after four cycles of chemotherapy in all patients with parameningeal tumors. However, there is a need for further evidence for optimal timing of RT in patients treated with contemporary chemotherapy regimens that are less intense.

RT is typically given over four to six weeks in once-daily fractions of 1.8 to 2 Gy. Although early guidelines recommended doses as high as 55 to 60 Gy for control of the primary, clinical practice has evolved over time, with the underlying strategy of reduced RT doses to minimize posttreatment complications. However, even with reduced doses, the decision to pursue RT in very young children (under the age of three) is difficult, as there are minimal data regarding the potential long-term effects of RT to various locations in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] and limited data regarding cancer outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Pretreatment factors associated with an inferior outcome included size &gt;5 cm, sites other than the genitourinary tract, and alveolar histology. Patients with alveolar histology who received adjuvant RT had significantly better FFS and overall survival than those who did not.</p><p>However, the recommendation that all CG I alveolar RMS receive RT has been called into question by a later analysis of 71 patients with CG I alveolar RMS who were treated in the IRS-III and IV studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. RT was assigned and not randomized, and 30 patients received chemotherapy plus RT, while 41 were treated with chemotherapy alone. Among the 54 patients with stage 1 (favorable site, any size) or stage 2 (unfavorable site, size &le;5 cm) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62717 \">table 3</a>) CG I disease, eight-year event-free survival (EFS) was similar with and without RT (90 versus 88 percent), as was local control (100 versus 92 percent). However, the small number of patients with stage 3 (unfavorable site, &gt;5 cm, node-negative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62717 \">table 3</a>)) disease did not have a favorable outcome in the absence of RT (eight-year EFS was 84 percent with 100 percent local control in the 13 patients given RT; eight-year EFS was only 25 percent with 50 percent local control in the four patients treated without RT). </p><p>These numbers are very small, and larger studies are needed before it can be concluded that RT is not needed in patients with alveolar histology and CG I disease.

In this group, RT doses from 41.4 to 45 Gy are sufficient to achieve local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In the IRS-III and IV studies, this approach resulted in five-year FFS rates of 75 and 87 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>The available data suggest that lower RT doses (36 Gy) are adequate in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy for patients with microscopic residual disease in the absence of nodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/10,11,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,57,58</a>].

The benefit of RT is supported by a pooled analysis of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">bladder/prostate</span> primaries treated in United States and European cooperative protocols, in which patients who did not receive RT for local control had an inferior EFS, although overall survival was not adversely affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>It may be possible to omit RT in certain subsets of patients, but this is not the standard of care in the United States yet and needs to be appropriately studied. As an example, for patients with localized vaginal disease, the last two United States trials, D9602 and ARST0331, attempted to omit RT based on response to chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, this approach led to an unacceptably increased rate of local failure. It is possible that this increased risk for local failure may be even higher with lower cumulative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> doses, as are currently used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53178\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53178 \">table 4</a>).

In IRS-III, the five-year FFS in this group was 70 percent and was better for those with node-negative as compared with node-positive disease (75 versus 45 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>In the most recent United States RMS studies, a dose of 50.4 Gy has been recommended for all sites except the orbit. Later studies support the use of even lower doses in children with CG III disease who have only microscopic disease remaining after induction chemotherapy, as determined by second-look surgery. As an example, in the D9802 protocol, doses as low as 36 Gy (for patients with a complete response after second-look surgery) and 41.4 Gy (for patients with positive margins after second-look surgery) were employed with equal local control and survival compared with previous protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

This is higher than the five-year cumulative local failure rate of 2 percent for similar patients treated in IRS-IV (n = 49), who received 50.4 to 59.4 Gy and alkylating-agent-containing chemotherapy. However, it is similar to the 16 percent cumulative local failure rate seen in CG III orbital tumors treated in IRS-III (n = 71), who received 41.4 to 50.4 Gy RT (depending on patient age and tumor size) without an alkylating agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the most recent low-risk RMS COG protocol (ARST0331, n = 62), these patients were treated with four cycles of VAC and 12 additional cycles of VA with 45 Gy RT for local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The cumulative five-year local failure rate was 13 percent overall, but it was 0 percent in the 15 patients who achieved a complete response after 12 weeks of chemotherapy. </p><p/><p>Taken together, these data suggest that reducing the RT dose to 45 Gy for orbital CG III tumors may not result in inferior local control for children when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> is part of the regimen and there is a good response to upfront chemotherapy. However, the number of failures in these comparisons is very small, and there is no legitimate statistical comparison. The result seen in the IRS-IV trial may in fact be the anomaly because it has the smallest number of patients treated among the four studies. It is difficult to make sound conclusions as to whether one RT dose is superior to the other based upon these limited data.

There were 20 patients with metastatic (CG IV, stage 4) embryonal tumors who were younger than 10 years of age (intermediate risk, historically) included in the cohort.

Patients with fewer than two Oberlin risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>] had a three-year EFS of 69 percent, a result that compares favorably with a historically treated cohort of patients with high-risk disease in the Oberlin cohort (44 percent EFS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In contrast, high-risk patients with two or more Oberlin risk factors did not benefit from this approach and had a three-year EFS of 20 percent. For the 20 patients with metastatic (CG IV, stage 4) embryonal tumors who were younger than 10 years of age, three-year EFS was 60 percent, which is similar to the three-year EFS of 59 percent for those treated on D9802 with VAC.

As an example, in a compilation of data on outcomes of RMS among 1071 adults (age &gt;19 years) and 1529 children derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), adults had significantly worse five-year survival (27 versus 61 percent). Tumors in adults were more likely to be at an unfavorable site (65 versus 55 percent, p&lt;0.0001) and to have histologies that are unusual during childhood, particularly the pleomorphic subtype and not otherwise specified. However, adults had overall worse survival than children for similar tumors. This was especially evident for localized disease (five-year survival 47 versus 82 percent).</p><p>The poorer outcomes in adults may, in part, reflect the inadequacy of primary treatment, as evidenced by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report of 82 adults with locoregional RMS treated over a 38-year period at MD Anderson Cancer Center, the 10-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 41 and 40 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

Results are most favorable when adults are treated in pediatric clinical trials, which are generally open to individuals up to age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/72,126\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,126</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) has evolved considerably over the past several decades. Using modern combined modality therapy, over 70 percent of children with localized RMS can now be cured. These improved outcomes are the direct result of the use of risk-based multimodality therapeutic protocols that have been developed by large international cooperative groups, such as the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG, now known as the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group [COG]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modern treatment includes chemotherapy for primary tumor cytoreduction and eradication of both macroscopic and microscopic metastatic disease; surgery, if feasible; and radiation therapy (RT) to control microscopic local residual disease. The specific treatment regimen depends on the estimated risk of a disease recurrence, which is based upon a variety of clinicopathologic prognostic factors, an approach termed risk-adapted therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53178\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53178 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Overview of risk-adapted therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some general principles underlying treatment of RMS are outlined below. Treatment is constantly evolving, and if the reader's goal is to obtain information on how to treat a specific patient, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> should contact a pediatric oncologist who is a member of the COG and who has expertise in soft tissue sarcoma for the latest recommendation. In general, adults with RMS are treated using the same principles as established for children. Results are most favorable when adults are treated in pediatric clinical trials, which are generally open to individuals up to age 50. (See <a href=\"#H272953390\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend complete excision for localized disease as long as functional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cosmetic results are acceptable (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). If complete resection is not feasible or if disease involves the orbit, vagina, bladder, or biliary tract, patients are better approached with an initial diagnostic biopsy followed by induction (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and then definitive local therapy. For disease at any primary site, palpable or radiologically enlarged lymph nodes should be excised and submitted for histologic evaluation, regardless of positron emission tomography (PET) avidity. The necessity of routine surgical sampling of nonsuspicious lymph nodes depends on the primary site. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Role of surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend RT to enhance local control in all patients with RMS except those who have <span class=\"nowrap\">embryonal/fusion-negative</span> clinical group (CG) I tumors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Although the benefit of RT has yet to be determined, current treatment standards in North America also recommend the addition of RT to all patients with alveolar histology and CG I disease, regardless of fusion status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59875 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical group I'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend chemotherapy in addition to local therapy for all patients with RMS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The choice of regimen depends on the estimated risk of a disease recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53178\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53178 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All eligible patients with RMS should be enrolled in one of the active clinical research protocols in any part of the world. In the United States, these are designed by the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the COG and administered by COG centers according to risk groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404 \">table 1</a>). For current open protocols, a member center should be contacted. Although in the United States pediatric oncologists treat patients up to the age of 20, any patient younger than 50 years old is eligible for these protocols. In particular, there is no standard approach for patients with high-risk disease at present. We suggest that all of these patients be enrolled in available national collaborative clinical trials or local clinical trials testing novel approaches. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Treatment strategies according to risk group'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant portion of children who are successfully treated for RMS develop long-term treatment-related sequelae. Specific long-term follow-up guidelines after treatment of childhood cancer have been published by the COG and are available online [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-adolescence-and-adulthood-treatment/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Long-term complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrences are often, but not uniformly, fatal. Standard therapy for relapsed patients is suboptimal, and the best regimen has yet to be identified. There are several active chemotherapy regimens, but local therapy (eg, surgery) should be considered if feasible.
