Squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix is more prevalent than adenocarcinoma. Screening can detect precursors and early-stage disease for both types. Treatment of precursors and early-stage disease can prevent the development of invasive cervical cancer.</p><p>Cervical cancer screening started with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test. In countries that adopted Pap test screening, the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer have decreased. In addition to the Pap test, screening methods now include tests for high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), which are central to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Role of human papillomavirus'</a>.)</p><p>While it is clear that cervical cancer screening decreases the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer, whom to screen, the optimal testing method (Pap test, HPV testing, or both), and frequency are debated. The benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening vary with age, medical history, and risk factors (eg, non-adherence to screening).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57840\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cancer is common among women worldwide. The incidence and mortality rates are related to the presence of screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs. Most cases of cervical cancer occur in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States, cervical cancer and cervical cancer mortality are rare in young women (&le;20 years) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F98524\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98524 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97704 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HPV</strong> &ndash; Infection with high-risk strains of HPV and persistence of HPV infection are the most important determinants of progression to cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Most risk factors for cervical cancer are associated with factors that increase the risk of acquiring HPV infection (eg, early onset of sexual activity, multiple or high-risk sexual partners) or impaired ability to clear HPV infection (eg, immunosuppression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Other oncogenic types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76394 \">table 1</a>) of HPV are less commonly associated with cervical cancer and cervical cancer precursors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations#H735670902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations&quot;, section on 'Cervical cancer'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is a high prevalence of HPV infection in sexually active women, particularly in younger women. Most young women will clear the HPV infection within 8 to 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The prevalence of cervical HPV infection decreases after the age of 30, but the likelihood of persistent infection increases. The epidemiology and prevalence of HPV infection may also vary geographically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations&quot;, section on 'Females'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonadherence to screening</strong> &ndash; More than one-half of women who develop cervical cancer have not been screened appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Furthermore, among women diagnosed with invasive cervical carcinoma, one-half have never had a Papanicolaou (Pap) test; another 10 percent have not had a test in the past five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In United States surveillance, never-screened and under-screened women tend to be those with no usual source of health care, the uninsured, and women who immigrated to the United States within the past 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In Canada, screening rates are low in women with disability and those with chronic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Multiple observational studies showed reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality as cervical cytology screening was implemented, leading to the adoption of screening programs in all developed and many developing nations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/18-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-28</a>].</p><p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies provide consistent and compelling evidence that screening leads to a decrease in incidence and mortality from cervical cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F98330\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98330 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 12 case-control studies, cytology screening was associated with decreased risk of invasive cervical cancer (odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% CI 0.30-0.41) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>The United States adopted screening with the Pap test in the 1950s, and by the mid-1980s cervical cancer incidence decreased by 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the United States has continued to decrease since the 1970s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97703\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97703 \">figure 4</a>). Furthermore, in observational studies, screening is associated with higher cure rates and decreased risk for invasive cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H7674594\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Incidence and mortality'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909961189\"><span class=\"h1\">HARMS OF SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of screening in decreasing the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer need to be weighed against the risks of overdiagnosis. Screening with Papanicolaou (Pap) test <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> human papillomavirus (HPV) testing may detect abnormalities that would clear without intervention, and this can lead to unnecessary diagnostic procedures and treatment. Particularly in young women, infection with HPV may be transient and cervical dysplasia may regress spontaneously. (See <a href=\"#H3213289\" class=\"local\">'Initial screening'</a> below.)</p><p>The most consequential adverse health outcomes related to cervical cancer screening arise from the downstream consequences of procedures used to diagnose and treat cervical abnormalities. The reproductive effects of treatment, which may include cervical stenosis, increased risk of second-trimester pregnancy loss, preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, and perinatal mortality, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Reproductive effects of treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other adverse effects of screening include discomfort, psychosocial consequences, and costs. The discomfort and inconvenience of Pap test screening are apparent, although not easily measurable. Both increase with the frequency and duration of screening and may be particularly relevant for adolescents and older adults.</p><p>A number of studies have examined the psychosocial consequences of screening. High levels of anxiety are associated with colposcopy referral for women with both high- and low-grade abnormalities and with surveillance for mild test abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Anxiety is heightened in women with a positive HPV test and in younger women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36</a>].</p><p>The costs of cervical cancer screening include both monetary and opportunity costs. Monetary costs relate to procedures that result from screening. Opportunity costs relate to overlooking potentially more important health care issues during medical visits in which cervical cancer screening is discussed and performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3213283\"><span class=\"h1\">ROUTINE SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The screening recommendations in this section generally apply to immune competent women who have an intact cervix.</p><p>Women in specific populations (eg, immunocompromised, status post total hysterectomy, in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure) may have different screening recommendations. (See <a href=\"#H546745154\" class=\"local\">'Factors that affect risk'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3213289\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, we recommend that cervical cancer screening be initiated no earlier than age 21 in immunocompetent, asymptomatic women. In such women, we suggest initiating screening at age 21, regardless of the age of initiation of sexual activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Other countries may initiate screening at different ages (usually between 20 and 25 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Observational studies suggest that the potential benefits of adolescent screening are offset by potential harms, weighing against aggressive screening in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Screening in immunocompromised women and diagnostic testing in symptomatic women younger than 21 years are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H3222108\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised women'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, the age-adjusted incidence of cervical cancer in women ages 15 to 19 years is 0.1 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Adolescents are also more likely to spontaneously clear human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and associated abnormalities. While rates of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) are consistently higher in adolescent women than in adults, 90 to 95 percent of low-grade lesions in adolescent women, as well as many high-grade lesions, regress spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. Furthermore, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for abnormalities may result in more harm in younger women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h#H448602\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cytology: Evaluation of atypical squamous cells (ASC-US and ASC-H)&quot;, section on 'Women ages 21 to 24'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Reproductive effects of treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Starting at age 21, women should be screened even if they report sexual abstinence. Women may have a variety of reasons for not disclosing prior sexual activity, including social, religious, or cultural norms as well as reluctance to acknowledge prior sexual abuse or rape. In particular, women who have been sexually abused or raped are often reluctant to acknowledge this history, and abuse may underlie the decision to not engage in subsequent sexual activity.</p><p>Guidelines in the United States recommend delaying screening until age 21 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82951 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer/abstract/6,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,46,47</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3213289\" class=\"local\">'Initial screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H546745154\" class=\"local\">'Factors that affect risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest screening healthy asymptomatic women age &lt;30 years with Papanicolaou (Pap) testing rather than HPV testing (either primary HPV testing or co-testing) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We screen women age &lt;30 years who do not have known risk factors with Pap testing every three years. More frequent screening only marginally increases the detection of cervical cancer but doubles or triples the number of downstream interventions. (See <a href=\"#H546745154\" class=\"local\">'Factors that affect risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women who have had any abnormal results may warrant more frequent testing and evaluation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-testing-of-the-cervix-management-of-abnormal-results\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus testing of the cervix: Management of abnormal results&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Primary HPV screening may be an effective screening modality in resource-poor areas. If primary HPV screening is used for women over age 25, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACOG)/American</span> Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) Interim Guidance recommendations should be followed. (See <a href=\"#H3213478\" class=\"local\">'Women &lt;30 years'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3216639\" class=\"local\">'The Papanicolaou test'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for cervical cancer in resource-limited settings&quot;, section on 'HPV testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest women age &ge;30 years and older who do not have known risk factors be screened with either Pap test every three years or co-testing (Pap test and HPV testing) every five years if both initial tests are negative (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Co-testing may detect cervical abnormalities earlier than Pap test alone, although it also leads to an increased rate of follow-up testing. (See <a href=\"#H3570212629\" class=\"local\">'Women &ge;30 years'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4049072773\" class=\"local\">'Co-testing (Pap test and HPV testing)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H546745154\" class=\"local\">'Factors that affect risk'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Earlier initiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more frequent screening may be warranted for women with special factors that increase risk (eg, immunocompromise, history of high-grade dysplasia, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol [DES]). (See <a href=\"#H546745154\" class=\"local\">'Factors that affect risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, we suggest that women aged 65 and older who have had adequate negative prior screening (three consecutive negative Pap tests or two consecutive negative co-tests within the previous 10 years, with the most recent test within the previous five years) <strong>not</strong> undergo screening for cervical cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We continue to offer screening for cervical cancer to women with a good life expectancy who have risk factors for cervical cancer (a history of an abnormal Pap test, current smoker or history of smoking, unknown prior Pap test history, previous HPV-related disease, or new partners) beyond age 65 years (generally until about age 80, but the upper limit of offering screening may vary with the risk factor). (See <a href=\"#H3213988\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing screening'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up#H717280032\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Treatment and follow-up&quot;, section on 'Subsequent screening'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally screen older women who have not been adequately screened with either Pap test every two to three years or co-testing every five years until age 70 or 75 years. (See <a href=\"#H3214712\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate prior screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that women who have undergone total hysterectomy (uterus and cervix removed) and who have no history of cervical cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) <strong>NOT</strong> undergo screening for cervical cancer or screening for vaginal cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). We suggest vaginal cytology for vaginal cancer screening for women with CIN 2,3 prior to, or diagnosed at the time of, total hysterectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3215104\" class=\"local\">'Prior hysterectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cervical cancer occurs in women who have never been screened or who have had only sporadic screening. (See <a href=\"#H57840\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3214712\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate prior screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effectiveness of screening also hinges on adequate follow-up and treatment for abnormal results.
