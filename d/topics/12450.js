This topic will review the concept of joint protection and will suggest approaches to evaluation and interventions that may promote joint health.</p><p>Specific applications of joint protection to particular sites are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-protection-program-for-the-upper-limb\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint protection program for the upper limb&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint protection program for the lower limb&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-protection-program-for-the-neck\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint protection program for the neck&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">What is joint protection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint protection is a process that includes the following two major components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individualized assessment of a patient&rsquo;s activities to ascertain the potential to contribute to worsening pain, inflammation, instability, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deformity of an already abnormal joint</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creation of a program to increase a patient&rsquo;s functional ability that includes altered work methods, behavioral modifications, and good body mechanics and that is supplemented, if necessary, with splints, braces, or adaptive equipment designed to minimize further joint damage</p><p/><p>The process of joint protection also includes energy conservation, which is a paced, more efficient use of muscles and joints. These principles encourage people with musculoskeletal problems to utilize their bodies in a manner to minimize pain, swelling, and associated limitations of movement and function. Occupational therapists have training that allows them to assess patients and to provide individualized joint protection advice.</p><p>Although &ldquo;joint protection&rdquo; is the classic terminology, &ldquo;joint care&rdquo; more accurately describes the goal of these principles. &ldquo;Protection,&rdquo; as used in this context, does not denote strict avoidance of use. Indeed, joint immobilization for a prolonged period can contribute negatively to joint problems by promoting articular stiffness and muscular weakness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">What is ergonomics?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ergonomics is defined as the science related to humans and their work, embodying the anatomic, physiologic, and mechanical principles affecting the efficient use of human energy. Safe lifting techniques, proper posture, appropriate seating position, and adaptive equipment are only a few of the many examples of ergonomics in the workplace.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Who benefits from joint protection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint protection was originally designed for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with the goals of reducing pain and inflammation and of protecting their fragile joint capsules and ligaments. These principles were subsequently expanded to include individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and overuse conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of joint protection and energy conservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence that joint protection relieves pain, reduces local inflammation, and maintains functional ability. An overview of systematic reviews found high-quality evidence for beneficial effects of joint protection and patient education, with pain, function, and patient global assessment being the primary outcomes of interest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The following are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are able to identify activities that cause pain and experience an improvement when using joint protection techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint protection education programs, conducted with groups of patients, significantly improve joint protection adherence and maintain long-term functional ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupational therapy (OT) intervention was compared with usual care in a study that randomly assigned 127 patients with early RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. After four years of follow-up, the joint protection group had a significantly greater improvement in the following domains: joint protection adherence, early morning stiffness, and arthritis impact measurement score-2 (AIMS2) activities of daily living (ADL) scores. The joint protection group also had significantly fewer hand deformities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with RA who participated in an education-behavioral joint protection program also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain and increased function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. At 12 months, those in the group education had a 5 percent decrease in hand pain while those in the control group had a 3.9 percent increase in pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of an elastic wrist orthosis resulted in decreased pain and significantly increased grip strength among women with RA during selected ADLs compared with a reference group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>There is also evidence that muscle strengthening decreases pain and improves function. The beneficial effects of strength training in RA and OA are presented in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-therapies-and-preventive-measures-for-patients-with-rheumatoid-arthritis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic therapies and preventive measures for patients with rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H849299743\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">THE PRINCIPLES OF JOINT PROTECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following principals are the foundation of patient education in joint protection. Each is discussed in more detail below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respect pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distribute the load over stronger joints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larger surface areas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce excess body weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use good posture and body mechanics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simplify work by using efficiency principles: plan, organize, and balance work with rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remain active to maintain and increase strength and range of motion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Respect pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activities that worsen joint pain warrant modification. Some patients avoid activity in order to prevent pain. Those who do this are more likely to experience increased joint stiffness and to become deconditioned. Other patients persevere in their activities despite pain.</p><p>Learning to respect pain involves attending to it and to aspects of activities that cause or worsen joint pain, followed by making an assessment and plan based upon previous experience, with the goal of continuing important activities with a minimum of pain. As an example, if pain results from too much activity, patients can try to take more rest breaks, perform tasks with adapted equipment, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> otherwise modify how they carry out activities. If such modifications fail to prevent pain due to a particular task that could previously be performed with a minimum of discomfort, it may indicate a change in disease, and a clinician should be consulted.</p><p>For the patient who is deconditioned or inactive, exercise can initially reproduce or increase pain. Encourage patients to communicate with their therapist regarding the modification of their exercise program rather than stopping exercise completely. Often the pain is of muscular origin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">The two-hour pain rule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This rule is a useful guideline to evaluate excessive activity. If a patient has pain for two hours after the activity, it means he or she has done too much. While there are several time frames suggested in the literature, the Arthritis Foundation and the Arthritis Self-Management Course advocate use of the two-hour pain rule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Factors affecting activity-related joint pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many factors can influence the onset and intensity of joint pain that is activity-related. The following are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time &ndash; The length of time one spends on an activity can influence pain. As an example, five minutes of an activity may be manageable, but an hour of the same task may result in pain that lasts for a few days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight &ndash; Weight can influence pain in more than one way. Carrying a small bag of groceries with a few items may not cause any difficulties, but a full 10 lb (4.5 kg) bag of groceries can cause or worsen hand or knee pain depending upon the vulnerable joints. Pain can also occur from carrying too much body weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repetition &ndash; The number of repetitions of an activity that cause or worsen pain is notable. Stapling a few sheets of paper may not cause any pain, but stapling 25 or 50 handouts may cause significant pain that lingers for hours or days.</p><p/><p>Lifting, climbing, kneeling, and squatting are work activities affected by time, weight, and repetition. A systematic review found that longer cumulative exposure to kneeling or squatting in the workplace is associated with a higher risk of knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Distribute the load</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distribute the load over stronger joints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larger surface areas. Large joints are stronger than small ones. This is a basic body mechanics principle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Using larger joints will reduce strain that can overstretch ligaments and that can create instability. Even if one&rsquo;s joints are very stable, large loads on small joints can strain structures and can cause pain. Small hand joints are vulnerable to pain or inflammation when used too much or too often. When possible, patients should spread the load over several joints. Consider using an open hand rather than fingers to wash a table. One can wear a purse or satchel over their shoulder if they have a vulnerable elbow or hands. A backpack may be used if the shoulder is painful. These are good ways to spread the load over greater surface area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid prolonged immobility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods. Joints that are kept in one position for long periods of time are inclined to get stiff (gel phenomenon). Immobilization of a joint for days or weeks can lead to muscle atrophy and joint contractures. Many patients complain of stiffness in their knees when they sit for long periods of time. Some people relieve stiffness by sitting on the aisle so they have the room to periodically stretch out bent knees during a play or movie. Often patients make these changes independently, and health professionals reinforce them. Clinicians can facilitate the process by asking patients, &ldquo;When do you find yourself getting stiff in that joint?&rdquo; Other questions include &ldquo;Is there anything you already do that helps at least some of the time?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is there anything else you can do that would help you manage your pain or stiffness?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduce excess body weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With inactivity, it is easy to gain extra body weight. Excess weight puts a strain on the body, especially lower extremity joints such as hips, knees, and ankles. Excess body weight is a powerful risk factor for developing osteoarthritis (OA). Even modest amounts of weight loss may improve symptoms and function in patients with OA. The role of obesity in causation of OA and the role of weight loss in treatment of OA are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Obesity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H2301488914\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Weight loss'</a>.)</p><p>Extra weight can also result in strain on the lower back area. Some patients may compensate for abdominal obesity by developing an increased lumbar lordosis. Encourage patients to maintain a normal weight for their height and build. Weight loss often results in decreased pain and in increased energy. These patients may need to increase exercise, and the Arthritis Foundation pool program is one exercise option that can be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Use good posture and body mechanics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another tenet of ergonomics and good biomechanics is that each joint should be used in its most anatomically stable and functional plane. Good body mechanics and posture can have a powerful impact by minimizing musculoskeletal strain and thereby preventing or reducing pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Spine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three normal curves of the spine, at the neck (cervical lordosis), middle back (thoracic kyphosis), and lower back (lumbar lordosis) are gentle and small. Each of these curves is ideally maintained in the midrange of available motion. This position is called neutral spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this position, the gentle curves absorb shock and provide stability. A slumped posture, a rigid military posture, and sustained sitting (or standing) in a single position without positional shift can contribute to spine discomfort. Also, knee position, specifically hyperextended knees, can change the position of the back and, in some cases, may contribute to back pain. Performing repetitive tasks in compromised posture, such as viewing a computer monitor in neck flexion, often results in pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral joints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All body parts experience less strain in the neutral position. Patients are less vulnerable to wrist pain and strain when they avoid extremes of flexion and extension. A knee that is neither locked nor flexed is more stable.</p><p>People are often unaware of the impact of poor body mechanics and posture on their body. Teaching people with arthritis or overuse problems to be meticulous in their body mechanics and posture can have a significant impact on decreasing pain. While it takes more energy initially, once it becomes a habit, it takes less energy to maintain good posture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Use the minimum necessary force</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squeezing and pinching activities put stress on the small joints of the hand. Patients can use less force by consciously holding equipment with less effort, by taking rest breaks, and by using special equipment. Patients with OA of the knees can descend stairs backwards, as this decreases joint forces in both the supporting and leading legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Adaptive devices and splints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with painful hand and wrist problems, specially made or adapted devices allow forces to be spread over larger areas and permit joints to operate nearer the mid range of their motion. Lightweight equipment with built-up handles of about one inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter can decrease the amount of force on joints. Built-up handles can also help individuals with weak hands. A study of 53 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) showed that pain was significantly reduced when assistive devices were used for activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Another study demonstrated that nighttime hand-positioning splinting also improved grip and pinch strength, as well as upper limb function and functional status in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Foam pipe insulation, widely available, can be cut to length and can be used as grip cushions on tools, handles, brooms, etc. Combining adaptive equipment with joint protection education and exercise resulted in improved grip strength and global hand function in patients with hand OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Splints can also reduce force on vulnerable areas during functional activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There is a wide variety of commercially available adaptive devices available, and they are generally identified by the terms &ldquo;adaptive devices&rdquo; or &ldquo;assistive devices.&rdquo;</p><p>Examples of adaptive devices can be found on several websites on the internet:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.rsi.deas.harvard.edu/&amp;token=N8sqUzoYeJi+O9M/hzbAD/4MtsVZ5ONiRmk8DWR4h6NKgxr8M3rsWWTUbzaP8sao&amp;TOPIC_ID=7754\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.rsi.deas.harvard.edu/</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.arthritis.org/&amp;token=oMC3X1+WCiEAM8+ZRgy2kHbbFOfp7tg28bq8gUNcLvpA+dTBrfHMx9H3uzo/Hssr&amp;TOPIC_ID=7754\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.arthritis.org</a></p><p/><p>Also, examples can be seen in The Arthritis Helpbook [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], available in book stores and through the Arthritis Foundation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1706451587\"><span class=\"h3\">Assistive devices for gait</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of a cane in the contralateral hand decreases loading on the knee joint through reducing ground reaction forces and reducing the knee adduction moment. A randomized trial of patients with knee OA demonstrated significantly diminished pain and improved physical function after two months of daily cane use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis#H1467167468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Walking aids'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Simplify work by using efficiency principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Planning, organizing, and balancing work with rest are useful principals to employ to reduce stress on joints. Teaching joint protection and efficiency principles in a structured six-week occupational therapy program produced a trend toward improvement in pain, fatigue, and activity levels, as well as a better balance of rest and activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Moderate evidence supports balancing work with rest (activity pacing) as an occupational therapy intervention for hip and knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who plan ahead can find the best time of day to perform a task, can allow enough time, can eliminate steps, and can simplify the task. By planning ahead, the patient may recognize that getting help to perform a difficult task can reduce stress and pain during a busy week. Patients tend to have less pain when they avoid rushing, simplify tasks, and spread out difficult tasks such as cleaning activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Organizing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organizing tasks also makes them easier. Having supplies at easy to reach locations, between eye-level and hip-level, prevents excess strain on joints. Duplicating supplies in different locations avoids excess energy expenditure, and eliminating clutter helps patients avoid awkward positions and save time and energy in finding items.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Resting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should schedule rest breaks during the day. Breaks give patients an opportunity to rest their joints, thereby avoiding pain and inflammation. Alternating heavy and light tasks is another way to take pressure off joints. Many people alternate between sitting and standing activities to put less strain on joints. If work requires sitting all day, encourage patients to walk around and stretch periodically. If work requires prolonged standing in one location, placing a block of wood on the floor and stepping upon it with alternating feet may reduce strain.</p><p>For problems in the workplace, the patient should seek professional consultation with an onsite occupational health nurse or referral to an occupational therapist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Using a computer workstation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ergonomically coordinated workstation can minimize joint and body strain. Although, at first glance, working at a computer workstation looks like a low-strain activity, regular computer use can cause or contribute to back pain, neck pain, muscle fatigue, carpal tunnel syndrome, wrist fatigue, shoulder fatigue, headache, and eyestrain. Useful information can be learned by asking the patient how much time he or she spends on a computer and what other types of activity or exercise he or she does in an average week. All patients who work at a computer station who have any joint problems or signs of repetitive strain should be asked about their computer workstations at work <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> home, including how often and how long they use these workstations.</p><p>There are several key principles to follow to reduce risk of repetitive strain injury (RSI) and pain. These include good posture, proper placement of equipment, fitness maintenance, and regular rest breaks. Good posture and body alignment are key to any computer workstation. Below is a brief posture checklist for good posture at a computer station:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head and neck balanced and in-line with torso</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trunk perpendicular to floor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoulders relaxed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elbows close to body and supported</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower back supported</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrists and hands in-line with forearms (neutral alignment)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thighs parallel to the floor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hips, knees, and feet at 90 angles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feet flat on floor</p><p/><p>The following website includes detailed information about workstation setup and correct posture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/checklist.html&amp;token=aoosTiauHZlUaHTTcV802spIgMRbsP5dW5GQXhtPNYd8APP+6tPqGZsKR3FN7RX7z/bc9ur44nqWbNXIVH1AFGBwBCWwpSiFMz0eGmBXjEw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7754\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/checklist.html</a></p><p/><p>The placement of the monitor, keyboard, and mouse is key to an effective workstation. Position the top of the monitor at or just below eye level. Make sure there is adequate room for the keyboard and mouse. If too far away or cramped, the operator will not be able to maintain posture as suggested above. Consider a wrist rest so that the body has a point of contact. If there are preexisting thumb or hand problems, consider an ergonomic mouse; one that has software that allows click-less use is available. Some of these devices are available through the <a href=\"http://arthritis.org/&amp;token=bi6QYDkHV7UQ1Ee49ldif2jp5RKLI9LPKB0MOhu3zO0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7754\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Arthritis Foundation</a>. If the patient talks on the phone frequently, a headset is highly recommended.</p><p>Continuous work on the computer puts a strain on the body. The speed of the computer has eliminated the short rest breaks that were provided by typewriters in the past (ie, return of the carriage, loading of new paper). These regular and short breaks provided opportunities for the body to rest and restore. Individuals need to take these rest breaks regularly themselves. Exercises improve circulation, increase mobility, and prevent pain and discomfort.</p><p>For example, every hour, the worker can perform warm-up exercises and stretches. Hand and thumb stretches for 10 seconds periodically can be helpful. Performing regular aerobic exercise improves blood flow and the body&rsquo;s muscle endurance. Strong muscles can also tolerate more stress. Those who are fit will be able to work at their workstations longer without developing symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Remain active</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are encouraged to remain active to maintain and increase strength and range of motion. Movement is vital to living. Exercise plays an important role in control of body weight, in cardiovascular fitness, and in the prevention of coronary heart disease, and, when individualized for a patient with musculoskeletal disorders, exercise generally is expected to improve rather than worsen joint pain and function. A systematic review found strong evidence to support physical activity, such as aquatic, aerobic, and resistive exercise, to improve function, pain, depression, and disease symptoms among people with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. More detailed discussions of exercise for patients with OA and RA are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-therapies-and-preventive-measures-for-patients-with-rheumatoid-arthritis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic therapies and preventive measures for patients with rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H849299743\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type and amount of exercise depend upon the person for whom it is prescribed. Walking, swimming, and biking are low-impact or non-impact forms of exercise that many people with arthritis can safely perform. Patients with arthritis may need some modifications, such as a longer warm-up and cool-down than the general population. If individuals need help with selecting appropriate exercises or with beginning an aerobic program, they may benefit from a referral to an occupational therapist, a physical therapist, or an exercise physiologist. Some hospital-based fitness programs have professionals on staff who have special training to help people with chronic illness and arthritis.</p><p>Muscle weakness may contribute to the development of OA. The evidence related to this association is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Muscle weakness'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Muscle strength'</a>.)</p><p>Caution needs to be applied for patients with lax or malaligned knees as greater quadriceps strength may increase progression of preexisting arthritis. Such patients should be referred to a physical therapist who specializes in treating people with arthritis knee problems. Treatment may include modified exercises and appropriate bracing. Caution is also indicated for physical activity after knee or hip arthroplasty. Clinical consensus statements prohibit high-impact sports such as running, football, baseball, basketball, and soccer but encourage participation in non-impact or low-impact sports such as swimming, cycling, walking, etc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Some patients are not interested in a formal exercise program. Health benefits, largely cardiovascular, associated with formal exercise also occur with accumulated lifestyle physical activity. Examples of moderate-intensity lifestyle physical activity that patients with arthritis may perform include light housework, shopping, gardening, clearing walks and driveways, child care, care of older adults, leisure walking, and pool exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The role of exercise in general health promotion is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;, section on 'Exercise prescription'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT JOINT PROTECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Who teaches joint protection or joint care?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occupational and physical therapists teach patients how to care for their joints and how to use them wisely. Occupational therapists tend to have expertise in teaching patients specific ways to protect their hands and ways to use them in daily activities, while physical therapists tend to have expertise in teaching specific ways to protect knees and hips. Additionally, both instruct in proper body mechanics, posture, and transfers, with physical therapists more focused on ambulation and occupational therapists more focused on daily living activities. Other professionals, including exercise physiologists, may also have special training. Patients should be encouraged to check the training, as well as the certification or licensure, of individuals they consult and to consult orthopaedists and rheumatologists for referral, as these clinicians often have working relationships with therapists with relevant interest and expertise. A systematic review found moderate evidence that educational interventions provided by occupational therapists for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that focus on joint protection and energy conservation improve joint protection behaviors. There was also strong evidence supporting pain management education and psychosocial interventions, emphasizing mindful thinking, to improve disease activity, physical function, and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Is there a role for personal trainers?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The training of a personal trainer may range from nothing to a certificate after studying a syllabus and passing a written exam or to brief clinical experience. In the United States, the National Academy of Sports Medicine, the American College of Sports Medicine, the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America, and the American Council on Exercise provide clinics for hands-on training. However, simply being certified is no guarantee of competence. Some personal trainers can provide useful exercise information for healthy individuals who want to exercise in a gymnasium or health club, but their ability to advise patients with arthritis is likely to be inferior to that of a physical or occupational therapist.</p><p>Thus, if the patient has symptomatic or advanced osteoarthritis (OA) or an inflammatory arthritis, we suggest referral to a physical therapist for assessment and structuring of any activity as part of a health club program. Then, if a trainer is to be used, the physical therapist recommendations can be provided as a framework for a personalized exercise regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">What constitutes quality joint care education?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinics provide handouts with lists of &ldquo;Dos and Don&rsquo;ts&rdquo; to teach joint protection skills. While these lists contain useful information, they are NOT recommended as the sole focus of education because they do not teach people to apply the material to themselves. A good program explores the tasks patients need to do in their daily lives and identifies tasks patients find painful or feel unable to do. Together with the therapist, patients learn and practice alternate ways to perform tasks using the principles of joint protection.</p><p>Therapists can recommend stores, websites, etc for special equipment and can recommend what to look for when purchasing equipment. The key to success is engaging the patient in the process of identifying difficult and painful tasks, as well as finding and practicing solutions. Many clinics perform this training in small group settings. This is ideal as the patients can learn from others and can explore more tasks than they might by themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/4,5,8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8,18</a>].</p><p>A behavioral program that focuses on self-management education has been found to be more effective in the long term in enabling people with RA to reduce pain, to improve psychological status, and to self-manage their condition, compared with standard information-focused education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">When should a patient be referred to occupational and/or physical therapy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Refer a patient who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has joint or overuse problems, who has repeated exacerbations of pain following activity, and who is unable to independently modify <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> behavior.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has OA of the hand, for evaluation of ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and for instruction in joint protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a joint injury and who does not know how to care for <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a newly diagnosed joint disease and who needs help learning to cope with <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> condition (eg, newly diagnosed RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/3,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26,27</a>]. Patients can benefit from splinting during a flare-up to relieve pain and to increase grip strength, though patients are more likely to gain full benefit from occupational or physical therapy with some degree of disease control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is deconditioned <strong>and</strong> who would benefit from strength or range of motion training and from referral to community resources to manage secondary effects of inactivity on <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> joint problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a need to find resources for self-help and adaptive equipment to manage independently at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is unable to successfully exercise at home or in the community.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has RA and is at high risk of work disability.

For those with varus deformity of the knee, an unloader brace may produce a significant decrease in pain and improvement in physical function. Patients with OA without severe deformity may experience a modest decrease in symptoms when using a neoprene sleeve. Bracing for patients with osteoarthritis is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis#H2337950959\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Knee braces'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">Splints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splinting of the elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP), and interphalangeal (IP) joints may be beneficial for patients with arthritis or tendinopathy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral epicondyle of the elbow &ndash; A wrist brace with a metal stay may be effective for some patients with lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow). This type of splint may reduce pain by reducing forces on wrist extensor tendons. Use of splinting and compression straps for patients with lateral epicondylitis is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylitis (tennis and golf elbow)&quot;, section on 'Bracing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrist &ndash; Prefabricated soft wrist splints have been reported to increase pinch and grip strength, decrease pain, decrease inflammation, and improve the patient&rsquo;s ability to carry out everyday tasks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The most consistent effect of splinting is reduction of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Prefabricated wrist splints are better accepted than hard (plaster or molded thermoplastic) splints by patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nighttime use may be preferable to continuous use for patients with RA. One study randomly assigned 50 patients with RA to the use of a nighttime hand positioning or to usual treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The group assigned to splinting had less pain, improved grip and pinch strength, improved upper limb function, and improved functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, in another randomized controlled trial with 120 patients, there was no significant difference between the two groups on measures of grip strength, deformity, hand function, and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Wrist splinting may also be beneficial for patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. Use of splints for carpal tunnel syndrome is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatment-and-prognosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Wrist splinting'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carpometacarpal (CMC) joint &ndash; Arthritis in the first carpometacarpal (CMC) joint of the thumb can be painful and can interfere with daily activities. Splinting the CMC joint effectively provides pain relief and is recommended in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for the treatment of the CMC joint in OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This benefit was illustrated in a prospective study of 33 patients awaiting joint replacement surgery for the CMC joint; 70 percent of patients who received splinting plus individualized education from an occupational therapist on how to avoid excessive loading and how to modify work environments did not require surgery at a seven-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Another study including patients with first CMC osteoarthritis showed that orthoses have been found to decrease pain without affecting function, grip strength, or dexterity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Splints for the first CMC joint may be molded to the patient&rsquo;s thumb and wrist from thermoplastic by an occupational therapist. Alternatively, a prefabricated CMC splint may also be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IP joint &ndash; Ring splints designed to provide stability and to improve alignment of the IP joints are pieces of jewelry fabricated from silver or gold. Their design prevents hyperextension of the IP joint. They can improve grasp and prehensile strength, as well as the appearance of the joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In a pilot study with 17 patients, ring splints significantly improved dexterity, and patients reported improved hand function. For satisfactory results, careful patient assessment by an occupational therapist and well-fitting splints are required. Patients with early-stage disease are the best candidates for extensive hand splinting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374299979\"><span class=\"h3\">Potential adverse effects of a splint or brace</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse reactions are uncommon for those wearing splints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> braces, although some patients with RA report decreased grip strength and dexterity with use of working wrist splints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Discomfort <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling are also sometimes reported by patients wearing night splints to manage carpal tunnel syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A 2005 systematic review found some evidence to suggest that long-term adherence to knee bracing for osteoarthritis is relatively low, but the reasons were not determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Neoprene sensitivity is another potential risk but is rare. Splints and braces made with neoprene pose two dermatological risks: allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and miliaria rubra (prickly heat). The most common symptom of ACD is severe itching at the contact site. Swelling in the contact area and distally is also common. Prickly heat is caused when sweat ducts are blocked by dirt, dust, or creams. Characteristic symptoms are small red, elevated, inflammatory papules that produce a tingling, burning, or pricking sensation. Thiourea compounds and mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) used in the manufacturing of neoprene are thought to be the causes of these reactions, which can occasionally be of sufficient severity to require hospitalization. These dermatological conditions may be underdiagnosed in patients using splints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-joint-protection/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-pustular-skin-lesions#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with pustular skin lesions&quot;, section on 'Miliaria'</a>.)</p><p>Strategies for reducing the dermatologic risks of splints and braces include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening patients for history of allergies to neoprene or other materials containing thiourea compounds and using alternate materials for those at risk</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educating patients regarding the increased risk from hot and humid environments. Patients should be warned against wearing splints over open wounds, during hot humid weather or work conditions, and for tasks that are likely to increase sweating. Stockinette is not recommended in hot humid environments because it does not act as a sufficient barrier to prevent allergic skin reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinuing use at the first sign of allergy.
