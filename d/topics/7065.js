The risk of bacteremia for well-appearing febrile infants 61 to 90 days of age is estimated at 0.4 percent with a risk for meningitis of &lt;0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This risk is similar to that of older infants. As an example, in a prospective observational study (conducted after the initiation of routine immunization of infants with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine) describing febrile infants 57 to 180 days of age, there was no significant difference in the incidence of SBI between those who were 57 to 89 days of age and those who were older (0.9 percent for both) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

For example, in a large administrative database study that evaluated the outcomes of over 49,000 febrile infants 29 to 56 days, 65 percent of infants treated in hospitals with CPGs recommending routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing underwent lumbar puncture (LP) compared with 48 percent in hospitals without such guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the increased CSF testing was <strong>not</strong> associated with improved clinical outcomes for infants treated in hospitals with CPGs and adverse events, including delayed diagnosis of meningitis, were <strong>not</strong> increased in hospitals where fewer LPs were performed (approximately 3 percent unadjusted adverse events for both groups, adjusted difference 0.3 percent [95% CI -0.2 to 0.9]).
