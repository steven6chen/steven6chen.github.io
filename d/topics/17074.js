Infants and children are affected more often and experience more prolonged symptoms than adults. The common cold accounts for approximately 22 million missed days of school and 20 million absences from work, including time away from work caring for ill children.</p><p>This topic review discusses the causes, symptoms, and treatment of the common cold in children. The common cold in adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The common cold in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON COLD CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common cold is a group of symptoms caused by a number of different viruses. There are more than 100 different varieties of rhinovirus, the type of virus responsible for the greatest number of colds. Other viruses that cause colds include enteroviruses (echovirus and coxsackieviruses) and coronavirus. Because there are so many viruses that cause the symptoms of the common cold, people may have multiple colds each year and dozens over a lifetime.</p><p>Children under six years average six to eight colds per year (up to one per month, September through April), with symptoms lasting an average of 14 days. This means that a child could be ill with intermittent cold symptoms for nearly half of the days in this time period, without cause for concern. Young children in daycare appear to suffer from more colds than children cared for at home. However, when day-care children enter primary school, they catch fewer colds, presumably because they are already immune to a larger number.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Seasonal patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common cold may occur at any time of year, although most colds occur during the fall and winter months, regardless of the geographic location. Colds are not caused by cold climates or being exposed to cold air.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colds are transmitted from person-to-person, either by direct contact or by contact with the virus in the environment. Colds are most contagious during the first two to four days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Direct contact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with colds typically carry the cold virus on their hands, where it is capable of infecting another person for at least two hours. If a child with a cold touches another child or adult, who then touches their eye, nose, or mouth, the virus can later infect that person.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection from particles on surfaces</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some cold viruses can live on surfaces (such as countertops, door handles, or toys) for up to one day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Inhaling viral particles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Droplets containing viral particles can be exhaled into the air by breathing or coughing. Rhinoviruses are not usually transmitted as a result of contact with infected droplets, although influenza virus and coronavirus can be transmitted via small droplets. Cold viruses are not usually spread through saliva.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON COLD SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of a cold usually begin one to two days after exposure. In children, nasal congestion is the most prominent symptom. Children can also have clear, yellow, or green-colored nasal discharge; fever (temperature higher than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C) is common during the first three days of the illness. The table describes how to take a child's temperature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57109\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57109 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other symptoms may include sore throat, cough, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and decreased appetite. The lining of the nose may become red and swollen, and the lymph nodes (glands) in the neck may become slightly enlarged.</p><p>The symptoms of a cold are usually worst during the first 10 days. However, some children continue to have a runny nose, congestion, and a cough beyond 10 days. In addition, it is not unusual for a child to develop a second cold as the symptoms of the first cold are resolving; this can make it seem as if the child has a single cold that lasts for weeks or even months, especially during the fall and winter. This is not a cause for concern, unless the child has any of the more serious symptoms, discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'When to seek help'</a> below.)</p><p>Symptoms of allergies (allergic rhinitis) are slightly different than those of a cold and may include bothersome itching of the nose and eyes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON COLD COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children who have colds do not develop complications. However, parents should be aware of the signs and symptoms of potential complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Ear infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 5 and 19 percent of children with a cold develop a bacterial or viral ear infection. If a child develops a fever (temperature higher than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C) after the first three days of cold symptoms, an ear infection may be to blame. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colds can cause wheezing in children who have not wheezed before or worsening of asthma in children who have a history of this condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinusitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have nasal congestion that does not improve over the course of 10 days may have a bacterial sinus infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who develop a fever after the first three days of cold symptoms may have bacterial pneumonia, especially if the child also has a cough and is breathing rapidly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON COLD TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of an infant or child with a cold is different than treatment recommended for adults. Antihistamines, decongestants, cough medicines, and expectorants, alone and in combinations, are all marketed for the symptoms of a cold. However, there have been few clinical trials of these products in infants and children, and there are no studies that demonstrate any benefit in infants or children.</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel has recommended against the use of these medications in children younger than six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We agree with this recommendation because these medications are not proven to be effective and have the potential to cause dangerous side effects. For children older than six years, cold medications may have fewer risks; however, there is still no proven benefit.</p><p>Parents may give acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) to treat a child (older than three months) who is uncomfortable because of fever during the first few days of a cold. Ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) can be given to children older than six months. Aspirin should not be given to any child under age 18 years. There is no benefit of these medications if the child is comfortable. Parents should speak with their child's health care provider about when and how to treat fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Humidified air may improve symptoms of nasal congestion and runny nose. For infants, parents can try saline nose drops to thin the mucus, followed by bulb suction to temporarily remove nasal secretions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67982 \">table 2</a>). An older child may try using a saline nose spray.</p><p>Honey may be helpful for nighttime cough in children older than 12 months.</p><p>Parents should encourage their child to drink an adequate amount of fluids; it is not necessary to drink extra fluids. Children often have a reduced appetite during a cold and may eat less than usual. If an infant or child completely refuses to eat or drink for a prolonged period, the parent should contact their child's health care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are not effective in treating colds. They may be necessary if the cold is complicated by a bacterial infection, like an ear infection, pneumonia, or sinusitis. Parents who think their child has developed one of these infections should contact their child's health care provider.</p><p>Inappropriate use of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic resistance and can possibly lead to side effects, such as an allergic reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Herbal and alternative treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of alternative products, including zinc and herbal products such as echinacea, are advertised to treat or prevent the common cold. There is some evidence that prophylactic use of vitamin C may decrease the duration of the common cold in children. With the exception of vitamin C, none of these treatments have been proven to be effective in clinical trials; their use is not recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON COLD PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple hygiene measures can help to prevent infection with the viruses that cause colds. These measures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand washing is an essential and highly effective way to prevent the spread of infection. Hands should be wet with water and plain soap, and rubbed together for 15 to 30 seconds. It is not necessary to use antibacterial hand soap. Teach children to wash their hands before and after eating and after coughing or sneezing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol-based hand rubs are a good alternative for disinfecting hands if a sink is not available. Hand rubs should be spread over the entire surface of hands, fingers, and wrists until dry and may be used several times. These rubs can be used repeatedly without skin irritation or loss of effectiveness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It may be difficult or impossible to completely avoid people who are ill, although parents should try to limit direct contact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children with colds need not be excluded from day care or school. It is likely that they spread the virus before they developed cold symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a household cleaner that kills viruses, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">phenol/alcohol</span> (sample brand name: Lysol), may help to reduce viral transmission.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a child develops any of the following features, the parent should call their health care provider, regardless of the time of day or night.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refusing to drink anything for a prolonged period</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior changes, including irritability or lethargy (decreased responsiveness); this usually requires immediate medical attention</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty breathing, working hard to breathe, or breathing rapidly; this usually requires immediate medical attention</p><p/><p>Parents should call the health care provider if the following symptoms develop or if there are general concerns about the child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever greater than 101&deg;F (38.4&deg;C) lasts more than three days.
