Infection and allograft dysfunction caused by rejection are closely interrelated through the use of immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The level of overall immunosuppression used for induction therapy, maintenance therapy, and the treatment of acute rejection episodes is the major risk factor for posttransplant infection, rather than the use of a specific immunosuppressive agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In addition, patterns of opportunistic infections after transplantation have been altered by routine antimicrobial prophylaxis for <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (previously <em>P. carinii</em>) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). These patterns are changing due to the emergence of new clinical syndromes (such as polyoma virus allograft nephropathy) and by infections due to organisms with antimicrobial resistance. New quantitative molecular and antigen-based microbiologic assays detect previously unrecognized transplantation-associated pathogens such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. These assays are used in the management of common infections such as those due to CMV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The risk of infection is influenced by a variety of other factors including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental exposure to an infecting agent, reactivation of a previously latent infection, or (rarely) active infection transmitted with the allograft.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of indwelling catheters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional status and metabolic factors such as uremia and uncontrolled hyperglycemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with immunomodulating viruses such as CMV, EBV, hepatitis B and C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of dialysis modality utilized prior to transplantation. Peritoneal dialysis is associated with a significantly higher risk of infectious complications after surgery, compared with hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>The occurrence of certain types of infections as well as the organisms involved tend to follow a general temporal pattern in the posttransplant period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58770 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is unclear whether the introduction of newer immunosuppressive agents will alter these temporal associations.</p><p>It is therefore useful to approach the differential diagnosis of posttransplant infection according to the time of occurrence after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. The remainder of this topic will review the approach to posttransplant infection; specific infections are discussed separately. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY POSTTRANSPLANT INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first month after transplantation, the usual postoperative surgical infections, similar to those seen in nonimmunosuppressed patients undergoing similar surgical procedures, are most common. Examples include bacterial or fungal organisms causing wound infection, bacterial pneumonia, and bacterial or fungal infections related to urinary or peritoneal dialysis catheters or central venous lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Occasionally, bacterial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fungal organisms are transmitted by a contaminated allograft, although donors are usually carefully screened for presence of contaminating organisms.</p><p>Opportunistic infections, such as those due to <em>P. jirovecii</em> and <em>Nocardia asteroides</em>, are rare in this time period, even though the patient is exposed to the highest degree of immunosuppression both to prevent and, in some cases, to treat acute rejection. This observation indicates that the duration of exposure to immunosuppression is an important determinant of the risk for opportunistic infection following transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ONE TO SIX MONTHS AFTER TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the period from one to six months after transplantation, infections with immunomodulating viruses, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV), are most important (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-cytomegalovirus-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of cytomegalovirus disease in kidney transplant recipients&quot;</a>). In addition to the clinical syndromes induced by these viruses, their immunomodulating properties predispose to opportunistic infections with such organisms as <em>P. jirovecii </em>pneumonia (previously known as <em>P. carinii</em>), <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, and <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>.</p><p>Other infections commonly occurring during this period include hepatitis; herpes simplex; herpes zoster; <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which can be complicated by the development of lymphoproliferative disorders; and recurrence or relapse of urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Infection in the majority of these patients is usually similar to that seen in the general population (influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, benign urinary tract infections, etc). However, approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients have chronic viral infections that become clinically evident at this time. Examples include cytomegalovirus (CMV) chorioretinitis, lymphoproliferative disorders due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), chronic hepatitis, and clinical acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p><p>A small number of patients (5 to 15 percent) have a history of multiple acute rejection episodes and high degrees of immunosuppression. These patients are at risk for serious opportunistic infections with significant morbidity and mortality. Examples include those caused by <em>P. jirovecii</em>, <em>L. monocytogenes</em>, and <em>N. asteroides</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIMICROBIAL PROPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are the recommendations we follow for routine antimicrobial prophylaxis of renal transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative surgical antibiotic prophylaxis with broad-spectrum antibiotics (which varies from center to center) for prevention of wound infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> is given for the prevention of urinary tract infection, sepsis, and <em>P. jirovecii</em> pneumonia and <em>Nocardia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>]. In one study, for example, 132 patients were randomized to receive trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo after renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Active therapy was associated with marked reductions in the incidence of urinary tract infection after removal of the bladder catheter (9 versus 36 in the placebo group), gram-negative enteric infections (4 versus 46), and bacteremia or fungemia (1 versus 9). The dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be adjusted according to renal function. The usual dose is one double-strength tablet daily, if the plasma creatinine concentration is less than 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (176 to 264 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> and one double-strength tablet every other day or one single-strength tablet daily, if the plasma creatinine concentration is greater than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (264 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Lower doses offer less protection against bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. We usually continue prophylactic therapy for one year in patients with normal urinary tracts. However, indefinite therapy is indicated in patients with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, anatomic urinary tract abnormalities, or a neurogenic bladder. Patients who are allergic to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be treated with any of the oral quinolones to prevent urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. Such patients should also receive effective prophylaxis against <em>Pneumocystis</em> with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atovaquone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atovaquone</a> 1500 mg daily or monthly nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a> 300 mg. The use of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> to prevent <em>Pneumocystis</em> is generally not recommended, as there is an increased incidence of hemolytic anemia in transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-infection-following-renal-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is essential in several clinical settings. The aim is to prevent primary infection in CMV-negative recipients of CMV-positive donors and to prevent reactivation of infection in some CMV-positive recipients, particularly those receiving antirejection therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a> (rATG) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>.
