Although AKI is reversible in most cases, its development may be associated with adverse outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kidney and patient outcomes after acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic reviews the pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, and diagnosis of iodinated radiocontrast media-induced nephropathy. The epidemiology of contrast nephropathy, preventive strategies for reducing the risk of contrast nephrotoxicity, and a discussion of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), the most common cause of AKI developing in hospitalized patients, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-kidney-injury-among-hospitalized-adult-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute kidney injury among hospitalized adult patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best data related to the pathogenesis of contrast nephropathy are from animal models. Studies show evidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but the mechanism by which ATN occurs is not well understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The two major theories are that ATN is caused by renal vasoconstriction resulting in medullary hypoxia, possibly mediated by effects of viscosity and by alterations in nitric oxide, endothelin, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adenosine, and that ATN is a direct result of the cytotoxic effects of the contrast agents on tubular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/12-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-20</a>]. Tubular cell injury may be exacerbated by renal vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/12,13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,18</a>].</p><p>Compared with other types of ATN (such as ischemic), contrast nephropathy is usually characterized by relatively rapid recovery of renal function (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below). If ATN contributes to contrast nephropathy, it is not clear why recovery occurs relatively quickly (ie, within a few days) compared with a longer duration (ie, one to three weeks), as with ATN due to other causes. One possibility is that the degree of tubular necrosis is much less severe than seen in other settings. It is also possible that the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is due to functional changes in tubule epithelial cells rather than necrosis. This phenomenon may be at least in part due to redistribution of membrane transport proteins from the basolateral to the luminal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In addition, it is possible that prerenal factors or intratubular obstruction contribute to the pathogenesis. This possibility is suggested by the observation that the fractional sodium excretion (FENa) may be &lt;1 percent in patients with contrast nephropathy, which is characteristic of prerenal physiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fractional excretion of sodium, urea, and other molecules in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;, section on 'Fractional excretion of sodium in acute kidney injury'</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical manifestations of contrast nephropathy are an increase in the serum creatinine and, less commonly, oliguria. Most patients are nonoliguric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/4,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23</a>]. In a prospective study, among approximately 40 patients who developed contrast nephropathy, none were oliguric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The increased creatinine is generally observed within 24 to 48 hours after contrast exposure and is mild. The creatinine usually starts to decline within three to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/8,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23</a>]. Oliguria (if it occurs) occurs immediately after the procedure.</p><p>Other manifestations of acute kidney injury (AKI) may be present, including hyperkalemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-kidney-injury-among-hospitalized-adult-patients#H598925613\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute kidney injury among hospitalized adult patients&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The urinary sediment may show classic findings of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), including muddy brown granular and epithelial cell casts and free renal tubular epithelial cells. However, the absence of these urinary findings does not exclude the diagnosis. The sediment does not show evidence of glomerular disease (such as dysmorphic red blood cells [RBCs] or red blood casts) or interstitial nephritis (such as white cells or white cell casts). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Urine sediment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H26746321\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Urinalysis'</a>.)</p><p>Protein excretion on presentation is absent or mild. However, many of the commonly used iodinated radiocontrast agents induce false-positive results when either a dipstick or sulfosalicylic acid is used to detect proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. How this occurs is not clear, but protein excretion may be overestimated by as much as 1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span>. Thus, the urine should not be tested for protein for at least 24 hours after a contrast study. If urine is tested and proteinuria is detected, the test should be repeated at least 48 hours after contrast exposure to exclude a false-positive result.</p><p>The fractional sodium excretion (FENa) is often &lt;1 percent in patients with contrast nephropathy. In one study, among 12 patients with transient oliguric AKI, all 12 patients had FENa &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a larger, prospective study of 443 patients, despite the administration of sodium chloride prior to angiography, the mean FENa was 0.3 to 0.7 among patients who developed AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The low FENa among such patients is in contrast to that in patients who develop AKI due to ischemic or toxin-induced ATN, which is usually &gt;1 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fractional excretion of sodium, urea, and other molecules in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;, section on 'Fractional excretion of sodium in acute kidney injury'</a>.)</p><p>Calculators for the FENa are available using either standard units (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-fractional-excretion-of-sodium\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or SI units (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-fractional-excretion-of-sodium-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>).</p><p>There are no characteristic radiographic features of contrast nephropathy. A prolonged nephrogram may be seen among patients with established contrast nephropathy who undergo an intravenous pyelogram (which is generally no longer performed in this setting) or a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of radiocontrast-induced nephropathy is based upon the clinical presentation, including the characteristic rise in serum creatinine concentration beginning with the first 24 to 48 hours after contrast exposure, and the exclusion of other causes of acute kidney injury (AKI).</p><p>The exclusion of other AKI causes requires a urinalysis and, occasionally, a renal ultrasound or biopsy.</p><p>Although the urinalysis provides important diagnostic information by excluding other causes of AKI, it does not provide a conclusive, positive diagnosis of contrast nephropathy. As noted above, the presence of classic findings of contrast nephropathy includes muddy brown granular and epithelial cell casts and free renal tubular epithelial cells (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above). In the appropriate clinical setting, these findings strongly support the diagnosis of contrast nephropathy, although the absence of these urinary findings does not exclude the diagnosis. However, the absence of other findings such as white blood cells (WBCs), WBC casts, dysmorphic red blood cells (RBCs), or RBC casts generally excludes interstitial nephritis and glomerular diseases as causes of AKI. Conversely, the presence of WBCs, WBC casts, dysmorphic RBCs, or RBC casts suggests causes of AKI other than acute tubular necrosis (ATN), such as interstitial nephritis or glomerular lesions.</p><p>Although an ultrasound is usually obtained among all patients who present with an elevated creatinine, we generally do not obtain an ultrasound, at least initially, among patients who have a characteristic presentation of contrast nephropathy following contrast exposure. However, we do obtain an ultrasound to exclude other causes of AKI among patients who do not follow a classic clinical course of contrast nephropathy or in whom the diagnosis of contrast nephropathy is questionable.

The former two require additional insults such as sepsis, hypotension, or medication exposure, which can be deduced by history.

In most cases, the creatinine usually starts to decline within three to seven days, and the patient returns to, or close to, baseline renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/8,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23</a>]. In one study that included 21 patients with contrast nephropathy, 12 (57 percent) returned to baseline renal function, and four additional patients (19 percent) had a partial recovery within five to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Only five patients had persistent renal dysfunction at the time of discharge.</p><p>Dialysis is rarely required for acute kidney injury (AKI) following contrast administration. In one study of over 1800 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous interventions, the incidence of AKI that was severe enough to require dialysis was &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The risk is higher among patients with severe, underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy/abstract/2,8,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,25</a>]. Occasionally, patients will require dialysis in the acute setting. The indications for dialysis are the same as in other forms of AKI.

This is especially noted among patients with underlying CKD among whom an episode of AKI results in a persistent increase in the risk of progression of CKD. This issue is discussed separately.
