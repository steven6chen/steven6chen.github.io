Accordingly, for patients with low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) or impaired platelet function, platelet transfusion can be of significant value in preventing and treating hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although many patients have an appropriate increase in platelet count when transfused with platelets, less than adequate results tend to be common with 28 to 44 percent of platelet transfusions failing to produce a satisfactory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In the <span class=\"nowrap\">hematology/oncology</span> patient, published reports have cited an incidence of refractoriness to platelet transfusion of 15 to 25 percent utilizing leukocyte-reduced blood products and even higher rates during the pre-leukocyte-reduction era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>]. This poor response to platelet transfusion leads to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, as well as longer hospital stays and higher inpatient hospital costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

However, the mechanisms are not completely understood. Several hypotheses have focused on immune and non-immune consumption, and sequestration, as well as decreased platelet production. In addition, consumptive processes such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemophagocytosis may contribute to thrombocytopenia in some septic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>DIC results in an increased rate of platelet consumption and refractoriness to platelet transfusion. This is a particular problem in cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia where DIC may result in an increased risk of fatal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Under normal conditions, approximately one-third of an individual's platelets are sequestered in the spleen where they are in equilibrium with the circulating platelet pool. In cases of extreme splenomegaly, splenic sequestration can be increased to 90 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52400\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52400 \">figure 1</a>). As a result, when administering platelet transfusions to patients with massive splenomegaly, it can be expected that a large fraction of the transfused platelets will be sequestered in the spleen, resulting in poor post-transfusion platelet increments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Normal splenic function'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8634026\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematopoietic cell transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), both allogeneic and autologous, is clearly associated with an impaired response to platelet transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. In one series, for example, 310 of 484 (64 percent) evaluable post-transplant platelet transfusions resulted in an inadequate response. This may simply be related to the fact that individuals undergoing HCT receive multiple platelet transfusions and therefore become alloimmunized.</p><p>Studies have documented thrombocytopenia related to HCT-associated liver disease (eg, from hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, also called veno-occlusive disease [VOD] of the liver). However, one set of investigators found no difference in the incidence of platelet refractoriness between HCT patients with and without the syndrome (56 percent and 60 percent respectively). These authors also found that 80 percent of patients who died from any cause experienced refractoriness to platelet transfusions, suggesting that platelet refractoriness may be an indicator of clinical deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

For example, administration of amphotericin B has been associated with a reduced corrected count increment (CCI) following platelet transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is usually immune-mediated and therefore transfused platelets, which are subject to the same immune-mediated destruction, can have a shortened lifespan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-immune-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16695453\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLOIMMUNIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of the various causes for platelet refractoriness, alloimmunization is the one for which there is the greatest potential for prevention and management. Platelet antigens causing alloimmunization can be separated into two groups, those that are shared with other blood cells and tissues, such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, and those that are specific to platelets, such as the human platelet antigen (HPA) system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16695460\"><span class=\"h2\">Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunization to HLA antigens is a major risk factor for refractoriness to platelet transfusions. Although platelets express only HLA Class I antigens, HLA Class II antigens present on leukocytes may be essential for the development of alloimmunization to HLA Class I antigens. Exposure to foreign HLA Class II antigens can occur through prior transfusion or from maternal-fetal incompatibility during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/2,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23</a>]. The importance of leukocytes in platelet refractoriness is illustrated by the findings in the TRAP study, which demonstrated a decrease in the rate of alloimmunization when leukocyte-reduced blood components were transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of alloimmunization'</a> below.)</p><p>HLA-A and HLA-B antigens are the predominant HLA antigens expressed on platelets; HLA-C antigens are not expressed well on platelets. While HLA-A and HLA-B antibodies are typically implicated, antibodies to HLA-C locus antigens have also been reported as a cause for platelet refractoriness. However, for practical purposes, in the United States at the present time, lists of <span class=\"nowrap\">blood/platelet</span> donors typed for the HLA-C locus antigen are not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The risk of HLA antibody formation may be increased in patients undergoing HCT when the donor is the patient's mother. This was demonstrated with two patients who received allogeneic HCT from their mothers; both donor-recipient pairs were mismatched at one HLA antigen, and both recipients developed refractoriness to platelet transfusion following HCT due to HLA antibodies derived from the donor's cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Each donor had probably been immunized during pregnancy against fetal HLA antigens inherited from the father.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16695467\"><span class=\"h2\">Human platelet antigen (HPA) system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While alloimmune platelet refractoriness almost always results from the production of antibodies to HLA Class I antigens on the platelet surface, antibodies to platelet specific antigens (HPA) have been described as a cause for refractoriness to platelet transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Red cell antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interestingly, some studies show that patients who have developed red blood cell (RBC) alloantibodies appear more likely to also have HLA antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In one report, 53 surgical patients with RBC alloantibodies were compared with a control group of 69 similar patients with a history of previous transfusions but who had not developed RBC antibodies. HLA antibodies were found significantly more often in the group of patients who had developed RBC alloantibodies (23 versus 10 percent). This may be a reflection of the degree of immunocompetency in these patients. In other words, patients who develop RBC antibodies are probably more immunocompetent and more likely to become HLA alloimmunized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16695474\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF PLATELET COMPONENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20949939\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukocyte reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of refractoriness to transfusion has been dramatically reduced given the widespread use of leukocyte-reduced blood components.

Platelet increments following transfusion of ABO non-identical platelets demonstrate a blunted response compared with transfusion of ABO-identical platelets with decreased recovery but adequate survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. This blunted response should not be confused with alloimmunization. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'ABO matched platelets'</a> below.)</p><p>Another issue relates to infusion of ABO-incompatible plasma (eg, transfusion of a platelet unit from a group O donor that contains anti-A to an A recipient) with which there is a 1:2500 to 1:9000 risk of hemolysis. In general, transfusion services have policies dictating the transfusion of ABO-identical or plasma compatible platelets when available. However, when these products are unavailable, the patient&rsquo;s indication for transfusion will outweigh the potential risk of hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16695481\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Refractoriness to platelet transfusion is defined in this review as a platelet count response significantly less than expected to <strong>two or more</strong> platelet transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16695488\"><span class=\"h2\">Measuring response to platelet transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our pragmatic approach is to accept an immediate (within one hour) post-transfusion platelet count increment (post-transfusion platelet increment [PPI]) of <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;10,000/microL</span> as an acceptable response. Our experience suggests that when evaluating a patient for refractoriness to platelet transfusion, a failure to achieve this cut-off of <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> on more than one occasion will truly define alloimmune refractoriness.</p><p>The corrected count increment (CCI) has also been used to measure the response to platelet transfusion based on a platelet count obtained 10 minutes to one hour post-transfusion:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>CCI = [PPI x BSA (m<sup>2</sup>)] x 10<sup>11</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> number of platelets transfused</p></div></div><p>This calculation requires knowledge of the number of platelets transfused, which is not always available. PPI represents the post-transfusion platelet increment (ie, post-transfusion platelet count minus pre-transfusion platelet count) and BSA is body surface area measured in square meters. Use of the CCI may be most appropriate for clinical trials.</p><p>In the non-refractory patient, the value of the CCI most often seen in practice is <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;10,000/microL</span>. This is roughly equivalent to a rise in platelet count of <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> in the average adult patient based on a BSA of 2.0 m<sup>2</sup> and transfusion of one unit of single donor apheresis platelets (or an equivalent pool of whole-blood derived platelet concentrates).</p><p>Our approach uses the definition of refractoriness to platelet transfusion as a CCI of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;5000/microL</span> on at least two sequential occasions; this is consistent with American Society of Clinical Oncology definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16695495\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining the cause of refractoriness to platelet transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use two measurements of platelet response when evaluating the patient suspected to have refractoriness to platelet transfusion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Platelet recovery</strong> &ndash; Defined as the increment in platelet count (PI) measured 10 minutes to one hour following transfusion.

Platelet survival should be sufficient to permit a gradual fall in the platelet count to pre-transfusion levels in approximately three days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82283\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82283 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p>Platelet refractoriness is considered to be present if there is a substantially smaller rise in the platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a substantially more rapid return to pre-transfusion levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The patterns of response seen in various conditions are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82283\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82283 \">figure 2</a>). Two patterns can be seen in refractory patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1653725\"><span class=\"h3\">Pattern for nonimmune causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A normal increment at one hour following transfusion (normal platelet recovery), with return to the baseline count within 24 hours (reduced platelet survival), is typical of the shortening of platelet survival seen with sepsis, following hematopoietic cell transplantation, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and possibly in bleeding patients and those taking medications that interfere with platelet survival. This type of pattern is not consistent with alloimmunization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1653732\"><span class=\"h3\">Pattern for alloimmune causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little or no increment in platelet count (reduced platelet recovery), even within one hour of transfusion, is seen with alloimmunization. In general, a poor platelet increment should be demonstrated after at least two transfusions before entertaining the diagnosis of refractoriness secondary to alloimmunization.</p><p>When the first pattern is present, little can be done to improve the platelet transfusion response other than appropriate therapy for the underlying disease. In contrast, effective modalities are available if the second pattern is present, which suggests alloimmunization as a cause of refractoriness to platelet transfusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73873\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73873 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>For patients who appear to be alloimmunized, we recommend testing a sample of the patient's plasma for the presence of antibodies to the human leukocyte antigen system (ie, anti-HLA antibodies). Methods to detect the presence and specificity of HLA antibodies include lymphocytotoxicity, ELISA, and flow cytometric immunofluorescence testing, depending on the laboratory performing testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. If the antibody screen is negative, testing for antibodies to the human platelet antigen system (ie, anti-HPA antibodies) should be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73873\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73873 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>At our institution, we do not routinely obtain HLA typing on refractory patients as our approach is to provide HLA-antigen negative &quot;compatible&quot; platelets (ie, platelets that do not contain the HLA antigens to which the patient has developed antibodies). However, if an HLA typing has been obtained for transplantation purposes, these results are also used to find HLA-matched platelet units. (See <a href=\"#H16695502\" class=\"local\">'HLA-antigen negative &quot;compatible&quot; platelets'</a> below.)</p><p>Not all detectable alloantibodies are clinically significant; HLA antibodies that are capable of activating complement may have a greater likelihood of causing platelet refractoriness. A modification of the technique using synthetic beads bearing Class I antigens is to detect only those HLA antibodies capable of binding the first component of complement (C1q) in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. If confirmed in other studies, this method may be better able to identify clinically relevant antibodies and to select acceptable platelet units.

In cases of non-immune platelet refractoriness, the underlying illness or condition (eg, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC], drug) must be treated. In cases of immune-mediated refractoriness, there are several strategies to consider when selecting platelets for these patients: provision of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched platelets or HLA &quot;compatible&quot; (antigen-negative) platelets; platelets selected by crossmatch tests; and maneuvers to reduce alloimmunization. Furthermore, given the transient nature of antibody production, patients diagnosed with refractoriness need to be regularly reassessed (approximately monthly) for the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/specificity</span> of antibodies in order to assure provision of compatible platelet units and avoid unnecessary use of more expensive and difficult to obtain compatible units.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16699776\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelet selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once antibodies to HLA or human platelet antigen (HPA) are identified, the transfusion service will work with the clinical team and community blood center to find compatible platelet products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">HLA antibodies against platelets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available approaches are listed below when HLA antibodies against platelets have been demonstrated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">HLA-matched platelets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional management of patients with HLA antibodies is to provide platelets from donors HLA-matched for the HLA-A and HLA-B loci.

This appears to be due to the inability of the patient's immune system to recognize these CREGs as different.

Under these circumstances, transfusion of platelets from partially mismatched donors may provide adequate responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>Alternative computerized matching techniques are now emerging and may further improve the ability of blood banks to provide apheresis platelets for HLA-alloimmunized patients. As an example, the HLAMatchmaker is a software algorithm that predicts HLA compatibility including acceptable mismatched options. This method takes into account matching for highly immunogenic HLA epitopes, HLA matching on a DNA rather than a serological level, and as well as HLA-C antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/48-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-53</a>].</p><p>Patients in whom HLA alloimmunization alone is responsible for platelet refractoriness generally respond well to HLA-matched donor platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/40-42,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42,54</a>]. Whenever HLA-matched platelets are provided to patients, such components should be irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. Furthermore, it is essential to obtain a 10-minute to one-hour post-transfusion count to monitor the response to these units. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Partial HLA matching'</a>.)</p><p>An HLA-matched donor can usually safely donate as often as twice a week for several weeks without becoming thrombocytopenic. However, for patients requiring longer periods of transfusion support (eg, aplastic anemia), it is preferable to locate several donors to support the patient's platelet needs.

This is a similar approach to the technique used to provide compatible RBCs for patients who have RBC antibodies. With this method, the laboratory does not intend to provide units that match for every antigen present, but rather finds units lacking only those antigens to which the patient has antibodies. At our institution, this is our standard approach, given the greater likelihood of finding a compatible unit.</p><p>This approach was described in 29 HLA-alloimmunized patients refractory to transfusion with random-donor platelets. In this study, a regional blood center was able to find a mean of only six donors per patient who were a four-antigen HLA match, and 33 donors who were identical at two or three loci, while they could identify over 1400 donors who were potentially safe by the antibody specificity method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16695509\"><span class=\"h4\">Crossmatch-compatible platelets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative approach is to identify compatible units of apheresis platelets by crossmatching the units with the patient's plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/42,52,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,52,55</a>].

The solid-phase red cell adherence test (SPRCA) is the most widely used method for platelet cross-matching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractoriness-to-platelet-transfusion-therapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Compared with HLA matching strategies, crossmatching can be both more convenient and economical.

It is also of benefit to patients with uncommon HLA types where it would be very difficult to find an HLA-matched donor.
