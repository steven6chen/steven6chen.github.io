The development of endoscopic sphincterotomy revolutionized the ways in which common bile duct stones were treated by permitting stone extraction from the bile duct with the Dormia basket or balloon catheters via a therapeutic side-viewing endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p>The fragmentation of large bile duct stones has been traditionally accomplished using mechanical lithotripsy, which is successful in approximately 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In the remaining 10 percent, gallstones resist conventional fragmentation due to size (&gt;2 cm), consistency (eg, bilirubin stones), anatomical position (eg, impaction), or accessibility (eg, intrahepatic stones) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Shock wave technology circumvents many of these limitations. Shock waves can be generated outside the bile duct (extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) and within the bile duct using electrohydraulic or laser technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>The main advantage of laser lithotripsy is that it permits precise targeting, thereby reducing the risk of bile duct injury.

Laser light is monochromatic, coherent, and collimated, creating a narrow beam of energy suitable for therapeutic applications in many medical specialities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Laser-tissue interactions produced by medical lasers primarily involve photocoagulation, photothermal ablation (vaporization), and photochemical ablation.</p><p>The underlying principle of laser lithotripsy is the generation of a high-energy shock wave capable of fragmenting intraductal gallstones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62498\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62498 \">picture 1</a>). Pulsed laser systems reduce the risk of thermal injury significantly since power peaks may reach the gigawatt range (10 billion W), but only for fractions of a second [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This is accomplished by using a small amount of energy delivered during an extremely short pulse duration. Prior to the availability of pulsed lasers, the continuous-wave lasers (eg, cw-Nd:YAG) were inefficient for stone fragmentation because they caused drilling effects in the gallstones and thermal melting instead of lithotripsy. In addition, cw-lasers emit radiation energy over a long period of time, which may lead to increasing temperatures on the stone surface and surrounding tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Photodisruption induced by ultrashort pulses of laser light is also gaining wider attention as an effective treatment for intraductal gallstones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80381\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80381 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2806102743\"><span class=\"h2\">Generation of a shock wave</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focusing the laser light to a power density of &gt;100 billion <span class=\"nowrap\">W/cm2</span> achieves so-called &quot;nonlinear optical effects&quot; in which electrons are torn away from their atomic nuclei and matter is transformed into a plasma state (a gaseous collection of ions and free electrons) at the stone surface and within adjacent fluid. The plasma expands at supersonic speed, inducing a spherical shock wave. Oscillation of the plasma bubble (cavitation) may cause further mechanical effects, such as tensile or compressive waves directed at the stone. This transformation of optical energy into mechanical energy is commonly called &quot;optical breakdown&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80381\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80381 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2753918936\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser-induced shock waves are ideally supposed to hit gallstones precisely within the biliary tree without affecting the biliary epithelium. However, in clinical practice, stone targeting under direct vision or fluoroscopic control can be difficult or impossible due to anatomic variations, bouncing fragments, or floating debris. Although nonlinear optical breakdown does not cause significant thermal energy exposure to the bile duct wall, potential hazards exist during laser lithotripsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Several in vitro and in vivo animal studies have demonstrated that deep penetration or perforation can occur if the laser fiber has perpendicular contact with the bile duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74446\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74446 \">picture 3</a>). The extent of damage does not seem to differ depending upon laser systems (dye lasers versus solid-state lasers) or laser fibers (bare fiber versus optomechanical coupling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], but is clearly worsened with increasing pulse energies and exposure time.

Laser eye protectors should be available at all times. Prior to inserting the optical fiber into the endoscopic delivery system, the laser should be adjusted and calibrated for output power and then placed in the off or stand-by mode.

Peroral retrograde endoscopy with a side-viewing therapeutic duodenoscope is the standard approach to the bile duct for the performance of stone fragmentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60664\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60664 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/5,41,46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,41,46-49</a>]. No randomized studies have been performed that directly evaluate stone fragmentation and ductal clearance rates depending upon the route of hepatobiliary access. However, in certain clinical settings where ERCP is unsuccessful, the percutaneous transhepatic approach can permit successful access to the bile duct (eg, Billroth II gastrectomy situations) or to the stones (eg, giant stones in a tortuous biliary system, stones above severe biliary strictures and intrahepatic stones) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/42,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,50,51</a>].</p><p>Because of the inherent risk of complications associated with the creation of a cutaneobiliary fistula (eg, subcapsular liver hematoma, hemobilia, biliary infection), the percutaneous approach should be limited to cases not amenable to retrograde procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Although the percutaneous transhepatic approach has been increasingly used, it is still considered to be more invasive and time-consuming compared to the peroral approach.

The originally described fluoroscopy-guided laser lithotripsy had a multitude of technical problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Because the procedure was performed blindly, the prerequisites for effective shock wave lithotripsy (perpendicular positioning of the laser beam to the stone and bathing in the irrigation fluid) could not always be achieved. In addition, there were reports of bile duct injury (eg, hemobilia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In an attempt to enhance procedural safety, the tip of a frequency-doubled double pulse neodymium YAG (FREDDY) laser fiber has been tagged with radiopaque marker for fluoroscopic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Newer devices permit adjustment of the laser fiber by providing an acoustic signal that indicates whether the fiber is in contact with the stone or tissue. However, these are not always reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Laser-induced lithotripsy coupled with an automatic stone tissue detection system permits stone fragmentation by means of fluoroscopy-assisted targeting, as in conventional ERCP, in a blind although intelligent fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/40-42,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42,47</a>]. Refinements of the fragmentation procedure (eg, balloon-guided approach) are regularly reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/33,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,56</a>].</p><p>The development of mother-baby endoscopy allowed for visual control during laser lithotripsy. However, a major limitation to this approach is that it requires two dedicated and experienced endoscopists and fragile equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laser-lithotripsy-for-the-treatment-of-bile-duct-stones/abstract/44,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,52</a>].
