The syndrome is heterogeneous clinically and biochemically. The diagnosis of PCOS has lifelong implications with increased risk for metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and possibly cardiovascular disease and endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. PCOS should be considered in any adolescent girl with a chief complaint of hirsutism, treatment-resistant acne, menstrual irregularity, or obesity. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>The cause of PCOS is unknown. Considerable evidence suggests that it arises as a complex trait with contributions from both heritable and nonheritable intrauterine and extrauterine factors, among which insulin resistance and obesity are most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Functional ovarian hyperandrogenism is usually the major source of the androgen excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>] and can account for the major features of the syndrome, ie, hirsutism, anovulation, and polycystic ovaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. This ovarian dysfunction is unique: it appears to be intrinsic and is characterized by abnormal ovarian steroidogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and folliculogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] that are manifested clinically by androgen excess and anovulation.</p><p>The definition, clinical manifestations, and differential diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents are presented here.

Over the past 25 years, internationally accepted diagnostic criteria have been developed for adults based on various combinations of otherwise unexplained hyperandrogenism, anovulation, and a polycystic ovary, which are all encompassed by Rotterdam consensus criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>].

While obesity and insulin resistance are strongly associated with the syndrome, they are not essential to the diagnosis; indeed about one-half of patients are non-obese. (See <a href=\"#H1359787606\" class=\"local\">'Associated metabolic features'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of this clinical heterogeneity, most cases will not have all of the primary features so it is sometimes challenging to diagnose PCOS.</p><p>It is important to appreciate that PCOS is a syndrome, not a disease, reflecting multiple potential etiologies.

These criteria are captured in four different phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], which are here listed in order of decreasing specificity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91893 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>). Hyperandrogenism severity decreases with decreasing phenotype specificity, as does the severity of insulin resistance, obesity, and luteinizing hormone (LH) excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/23-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-30</a>].

These criteria were developed in 2015 by a consensus panel convened by the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES), with representatives from international pediatric, adult, and reproductive endocrinology, adolescent medicine, and adolescent gynecology subspecialty societies. The consensus definition agrees with 2013 Endocrine Society clinical guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and has been adopted by a wide international endocrinology consortium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Whether a PCOS phenotype exists in which obesity is accompanied by intrinsic ovarian hyperandrogenism in the absence of hirsutism or acne and anovulatory symptoms remains to be determined. </p><p>These adolescent-specific diagnostic criteria are important because the diagnostic criteria for PCOS in adults have been problematic when applied to adolescents, for several reasons: First, anovulatory cycles are frequent in normal adolescents, with associated menstrual irregularity. Second, the common signs of hyperandrogenism in adults are less reliable when applied to adolescents, because hirsutism is in a developmental phase and acne vulgaris is common. Third, measurement of testosterone concentrations in adolescents is problematic because serum concentrations rise during anovulatory cycles, there is a paucity of reliable norms for androgen levels in adolescent girls, and the extent to which adolescent hyperandrogenism predicts adult hyperandrogenism is unclear. Fourth, polycystic ovary morphology by adult standards is common in normal adolescents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chief complaint in adolescent girls with PCOS may be hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, acanthosis nigricans <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obesity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76770 \">figure 1</a>). An abnormal menstrual pattern may be of little concern to the patient, but elucidating its presence is critical to the diagnosis in adolescents. Some patients have an abnormal degree of inflammatory acne instead of hirsutism, but cutaneous symptoms of hyperandrogenism are not necessarily present or of primary concern to the patient. Although obesity is commonly associated with PCOS, about one-half of patients are not obese.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1359792888\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous manifestations of hyperandrogenism</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Hirsutism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hirsutism is defined clinically as an abnormal amount of sexual hair that appears in a male pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It is commonly graded according to the Ferriman-Gallwey system, which quantitates the extent of hair growth in the most androgen-sensitive areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66629 \">figure 2</a>). Sexual hair growth matures throughout puberty to achieve maturity by two years after menarche, at about 15 years of age, based on sparse normative data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Hirsutism is defined as a score of 8 or more in the general United States adult female population. The normal score varies with ethnicity: hirsutism is defined in Asian populations like Han Chinese as a score &ge;2 to 3, and in Mediterranean populations as a score &ge;9 to 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Localized areas of excessive sexual hair growth (&quot;focal hirsutism&quot;) with a normal score is a common cosmetic complaint.</p><p>Hirsutism must be distinguished from hypertrichosis, the generalized excess growth of vellus hair that sometimes occurs on a hereditary basis or in patients taking glucocorticoids, phenytoins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazoxide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. Hypertrichosis is distributed in a nonsexual pattern (eg, generalized distribution or more prominent distribution on the forehead or shoulders) and is not caused by excess androgen, although it may be aggravated by excess androgen.</p><p>Hirsutism is a variably expressed manifestation of hyperandrogenemia. Approximately one-half of hyperandrogenic females have hirsutism or an alternative pilosebaceous unit response to androgen (sometimes called a &quot;hirsutism equivalent&quot;), including acne (see <a href=\"#H1359792857\" class=\"local\">'Acne'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1359792875\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> below). In the remaining one-half of hyperandrogenemic females, hirsutism does not develop, seemingly because their pilosebaceous unit is relatively insensitive to androgens.</p><p>Conversely, hirsutism may occur without elevated circulating levels of androgen; this is termed &quot;idiopathic hirsutism&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Idiopathic hirsutism accounts for approximately one-half of cases of mild hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey score 8 to 15) and one-sixth of cases of moderate or severe hirsutism (score &gt;15) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;</a>). Because one-half of the cases of mild hirsutism are due to idiopathic hirsutism, the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline on hirsutism is at odds with adult PCOS diagnostic guidelines that consider hirsutism <em>per se</em> to be clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism. Adolescent PCOS guidelines consider only moderate-to-severe hirsutism to constitute clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism, and also consider this to be less reliable evidence of hyperandrogenism than persistent testosterone elevation determined in a reliable reference laboratory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1359792857\"><span class=\"h3\">Acne</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive acne vulgaris is an important cutaneous manifestation of hyperandrogenemia in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Acne severity can be graded on the basis of lesion counts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107843 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. While comedonal acne is common in adolescent girls, the presence of moderate (&gt;10 facial lesions) or severe inflammatory acne through the perimenarcheal years suggests hyperandrogenemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/32,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,38</a>]. Such patients are often prescribed hormonal therapy for their acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], which masks hyperandrogenemia. In a group of young women with moderate acne without hirsutism, 25 percent had an elevated plasma free testosterone level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thus, there is consensus that moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne vulgaris that is persistent and poorly responsive to topical treatment is an indication to test for hyperandrogenemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1359792875\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Balding is an unusual manifestation of hyperandrogenemia in adolescents. When it occurs, it may be either male-pattern (affecting the fronto-temporo-occipital scalp) or female-pattern (affecting the crown, typically manifesting early as a midline part widened in a &quot;Christmas tree&quot; pattern) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Alternate cutaneous manifestations of hyperandrogenemia (&quot;hirsutism equivalents&quot;) include seborrhea, hyperhidrosis, and hidradenitis suppurativa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/37,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,41,42</a>]. Hidradenitis suppurativa is characterized by painful inflammatory nodules in intertriginous areas, particularly the axillae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Frank virilization (eg, rapid onset or progression of hirsutism, temporal hair recession, increased muscle bulk, voice deepening, and onset of clitoromegaly) is unusual in PCOS, and should raise concerns for another cause of hyperandrogenemia. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian findings</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Anovulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adolescents, the distinction between abnormal and physiologic anovulation is often delayed because patients, families, and clinicians alike often are unsure about the normal range of menstrual cycle variation. Normal adolescent menstrual cyclicity differs only slightly from that of reproductive-age adults. Cycles shorter than 19 days or longer than 90 days are abnormal at any stage; 75 percent of menstrual cycles range from 21 to 45 days during the first post-menarcheal (gynecologic) year, and 95 percent of girls achieve 21- to 40-day adult menstrual cyclicity by their fifth gynecologic year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/19,32,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,32,43</a>].</p><p>Physiologic adolescent anovulation presents a paradox: the proportion of cycles that occur at regular intervals is substantially greater than the proportion of mature ovulatory cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Most &quot;adolescent anovulation&quot; is asymptomatic, with cyclic menstrual bleeding occurring at 21- to 45-day intervals even in the first post-menarcheal year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107840 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This paradox arises because immature cyclic ovarian function is common during these intervals. Most regular adolescent menstrual cycles that are not ovulatory by adult criteria have urinary hormonal evidence of cyclic but immature follicular function that results in varying degrees of luteal insufficiency, due to varying degrees of attenuated ovulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107840 \">figure 3</a>). Serum hormonal changes during such menstrual cycles of normal adolescents show that substantial but immature cyclic follicular development is occurring, and that corpus luteum formation is inadequate to produce serum progesterone levels sufficient to support implantation and pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The following menstrual dysfunctions suggest an abnormal extent of anovulation in adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93199 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/19,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,43</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary amenorrhea &ndash; Defined as lack of menarche by 15 years of age (or by 15 years bone age, if puberty onset was early) or more than three years after the onset of breast development.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary amenorrhea &ndash; Defined as &gt;90 days without a menstrual period, after previously menstruating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligomenorrhea &ndash; During the first five post-menarcheal years, oligomenorrhea is defined as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Post-menarcheal year one: Fewer than four periods in the year (average cycle length &gt;90 days between menstrual periods).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Post-menarcheal year two: Fewer than six periods in the year (average cycle length &gt;60 days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Post-menarcheal year three to five: Fewer than eight periods per year, ie, missing more than four periods per year (average cycle length &gt;45 days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Post-menarcheal six and after: Fewer than nine periods per year, ie, missing more than three periods per year (average cycle length &gt;38 to 40 days).

Excessive uterine bleeding results from shedding of a hyperplastic endometrium exposed to insufficient progesterone.

However, endometrial biopsy in the broader population of patients with excessive nonstructural bleeding demonstrates that very few are completely acyclic and often shows evidence of diverse types of ovulatory dysfunction, including secretory changes consistent with luteal insufficiency and sometimes cystic glandular hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>], which is a direct effect of androgen excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p>An abnormal menstrual bleeding pattern (&quot;symptomatic adolescent anovulation&quot;) is almost always the result of anovulatory cycles and is cause for concern if persistent. Symptomatic adolescent anovulation has an overall long-term persistence rate of about one-third (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107841 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/19,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,51</a>]. In a study of adolescents with diverse menstrual irregularities of unknown etiology, as irregularity persisted for one to two years, actuarial risk for ongoing menstrual abnormality rose from 54 percent to 62 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In a school population-based study, 51 percent of girls who became oligomenorrheic at 15 years of age after initially menstruating regularly, remained oligomenorrheic at 18 years; no data exist for intervening intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Studies of healthy schoolgirls have shown that menstrual irregularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>] and above-average androgen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>] are significant risk factors for PCOS or infertility in adulthood.</p><p>The risk for ongoing anovulation is greater for hyperandrogenemic anovulatory adolescents than for non-hyperandrogenemic ones. Among girls evaluated for abnormal menstrual bleeding who lack clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, about one-half have elevated androgen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Reevaluation of such patients has shown that hyperandrogenemia resolves in about one-half; these girls have physiologic adolescent anovulation. Among the other one-half, PCOS is the single most common cause of a residual ongoing hyperandrogenic menstrual disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/52,57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,57-59</a>]. Furthermore, in the presence of clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism (eg, hirsutism or severe acne), hyperandrogenic oligo-anovulation (ie, PCOS) persisted for &ge;3 years in more than 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/22,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,52</a>]. Indeed, in a small series of adolescents with elevated free testosterone and documented functional ovarian hyperandrogenism of the PCOS type, follow-up showed that all still had PCOS as young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, the actuarial curve describing the prognosis for symptomatic anovulation seems to be comprised of two components: one for hyperandrogenemic cases, one-half of which persist, and another for non-hyperandrogenemic cases, few of which persist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107841 \">figure 4</a>). The transient cases are due to physiologic anovulation. The persistent hyperandrogenemic cases are mostly PCOS, and the persistent non-hyperandrogenic cases have some form of hypogonadism.</p><p>In summary<em>, </em>uterine bleeding at intervals more frequent than every 19 days, or less frequent than every 90 days, is abnormal even in the first post-menarcheal year, and most cycles occur at 21 to 45 day intervals from the onset of menses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93199 \">table 4</a>). In the absence of clinical evidence of an endocrine disorder, a menstrual abnormality that goes on for one year has about a 50 percent probability of persisting, and about one-half of the ongoing cases will have PCOS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107841 \">figure 4</a>). Lengthier persistence progressively increases the likelihood of underlying PCOS. Clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism such as hirsutism further increases the risk of PCOS.</p><p>The consensus group urged great caution before labeling hyperandrogenic adolescents as having PCOS if the menstrual abnormality has not persisted for two years or more. Prior to that point in time, they recommended that such girls be assigned the provisional diagnosis, &quot;at-risk for PCOS,&quot; to avoid misdiagnosing physiological pubertal changes as PCOS. They coupled this recommendation with one for frequent longitudinal re-evaluations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These recommendations place a higher value on the accuracy of diagnosis than on early diagnosis. However, earlier initiation of diagnostic testing <strong>is</strong> advisable if combined oral contraceptive (COC) or other medical treatment is indicated to regulate menstrual cyclicity or to treat comorbidities suggestive of PCOS (eg, development of hirsutism, moderate inflammatory acne resistant to topical therapy, and acanthosis nigricans). This is because delaying diagnosis also delays control of symptoms and increases the risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>). Occasionally, excessive uterine bleeding may mandate emergency evaluation early in the course. Primary amenorrhea should be evaluated when recognized.</p><p>In adolescents in whom a provisional diagnosis of PCOS has been made, the recommendation for longitudinal re-evaluation requires withdrawing COC for approximately three months when the patient is gynecologically mature (eg, upon graduation from high school) to determine persistence of hyperandrogenic anovulation; this maneuver should be coupled with contraceptive counseling because the infertility of PCOS is relative, not absolute.</p><p>While PCOS often begins during adolescence, PCOS sometimes cannot be definitively diagnosed until three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] or more after the onset of menarche.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Polycystic ovaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polycystic ovaries themselves have little, if any, clinical manifestation other than their relationship to anovulation, which is a weak association, as discussed in a separate topic review (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adolescents#H768363691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents&quot;, section on 'Ultrasonography'</a>).

These are the diagnostic criteria developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for adults, adapted for gynecologic age (see <a href=\"#H1209987250\" class=\"local\">'Adolescents'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evidence of hyperandrogenism (eg, hirsutism, persistent acne, pattern alopecia), particularly if confirmed by a persistently elevated serum testosterone <strong>and</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A menstrual pattern that is abnormal for gynecologic age (eg, menstrual irregularity, oligo- or amenorrhea, excessive bleeding) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93199 \">table 4</a>) and that persists for one to two years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescent girls with PCOS may present with hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, obesity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acanthosis nigricans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76770 \">figure 1</a>). Any one of these findings may be the sole feature of the syndrome, although one feature is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Some patients have other cutaneous symptoms of hyperandrogenism, including an abnormal degree of inflammatory acne. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hirsutism is defined clinically as an abnormal amount of sexual hair that appears in a male pattern. It is a variably expressed manifestation of hyperandrogenemia. Approximately two-thirds of hyperandrogenic females have hirsutism. Conversely, hirsutism may occur without elevated circulating levels of androgen (&quot;idiopathic hirsutism&quot;). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hirsutism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An abnormal degree of acne is suggested by moderate or more comedonal acne (&gt;10 facial lesions) in early puberty; moderate or more inflammatory acne through the perimenarcheal years; or acne that is persistent and poorly responsive to topical dermatologic therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107843 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1359792857\" class=\"local\">'Acne'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Menstrual dysfunctions that suggest abnormal degrees of anovulation in adolescence include fewer than six periods per year during post-menarcheal year two, fewer than nine periods per year during or after post-menarcheal year five, or excessive menstrual bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93199 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Anovulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although PCOS accounts for around 85 percent of androgen excess in adolescent girls, there are a number of conditions other than PCOS that present with hyperandrogenism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91894\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91894 \">table 5</a>). The evaluation for a patient with hyperandrogenism utilizes pelvic ultrasonography and specific endocrine tests to exclude these disorders and establish the diagnosis of PCOS.
