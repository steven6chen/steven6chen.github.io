The causative agent is commonly designated SFTS virus (SFTSV), a newly identified bunyavirus that appears to be carried by ticks (ie, <em>Haemaphysalis longicornis</em>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6263324\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV) is a new member of the genus <em>Phlebovirus </em>in the family Bunyaviridae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The closest relative is Bhanja virus, a tickborne human pathogenic phlebovirus that causes febrile illness and meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Bunyaviruses are largely spherical, enveloped particles with a diameter of 80 to 120 nm. Particles carry three genomic segments designated large (L), medium (M), and small (S).</p><p>The L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the M segment the glycoproteins Gn and Gc, and the S segment the nucleoprotein (N) and a nonstructural protein (NSs) using an ambisense coding strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The N protein encapsulates the genomic RNA; this complex is further associated with the L protein and forms the active <span class=\"nowrap\">transcriptase/replicase</span> complex. The Gn and Gc glycoproteins form a heterodimer and shape the spikes on the surface of the virion. The glycoproteins mediate receptor binding and virus entry and are the target for neutralizing humoral immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The C-type lectin, DC-SIGN, has been identified as one of the factors for SFTSV attachment and entry into cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The NSs protein serves as a type-I interferon antagonist that suppresses activation of innate immune responses via the <span class=\"nowrap\">IPS-1/IRF-3</span> and NF-kappaB pathways.</p><p>SFTSV has been classified into Chinese and Japanese lineages, consistent with the geographical distribution; the two lineages are further divided into six and four sub-lineages, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The SFTSV strains isolated in South Korea are clustered in the Japanese lineage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6263331\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) has been observed in central and eastern China, western Japan, and rural areas of South Korea.</p><p>In 2007, a new disease, termed severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome or fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia syndrome (FTLS), was recognized in the Huaiyangshan mountain range in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/2-4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,10</a>]. A new virus, designated SFTS virus (SFTSV), was isolated from patient blood; the case-fatality rate was 30 percent.</p><p>Enhanced surveillance using a new case definition and advanced laboratory testing has expanded the endemicity zone of SFTSV to neighboring provinces and defined SFTS as a broadly distributed major public health problem in rural eastern China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/2-4,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,11-14</a>]. Retrospectively, it was realized that SFTS outbreaks had previously occurred in 2006 and 2007, which were erroneously reported as human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Within central China, SFTS cases have been identified in Henan, Hubei, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Liaoning provinces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Hundreds of SFTS cases occur annually, predominantly between the months of May and July; this corresponds to the peak of tick and farming activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/2,4,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,16</a>].

Phylogenetic analyses indicated that all the Japanese SFTSV isolates formed a genotype independent to those from China; it appears two clades of SFTSV, the Chinese clade and the Japanese clade, may have evolved separately over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In Japan between 2013 (when the first case of SFTS was identified) and 2015, 161 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All patients were from western Japan, and the median age of the patients was 78 years; many were farmers or retired. Most cases occurred between April and August.</p><p>In South Korea between 2013 (when the first case of SFTS was reported) and 2015, 170 cases of SFTS were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The role of livestock and other animal species in the SFTSV transmission cycle requires further investigation.</p><p>Human-to-human transmission via close contact to blood and body secretions has been reported.

Gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/1-4,12,19,21,23,28,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,12,19,21,23,28,31-34</a>].

Meningoencephalitis may occur. Bleeding tendency may be observed in the form of mucosal hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disseminated intravascular coagulation. In surviving patients, these manifestations begin to resolve after 8 to 11 days of illness.</p><p>Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been associated with SFTS, with hyperferritinemia and evidence of hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow.

The time from symptom onset to death is typically 8 to 10 days. Poor prognostic factors include older age, decreased level of consciousness, elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase or aspartate aminotransferase, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6263356\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important factors in the pathogenesis of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV) infections likely include high viral load, inflammatory responses similar to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), coagulation abnormalities, and multiorgan dysfunction. Uncontrolled upregulation of several cytokines (including interleukin [IL]-1RA, IL-6, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], induced protein [IP]-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1) appears to correlate with disease severity, suggesting that SIRS is a significant factor in pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-fever-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-virus/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>Autopsy studies have demonstrated that lymph node architecture is replaced with massive necrosis containing histiocytes, immunoblasts, nuclear debris, and eosinophilic ghosts.

SFTSV and platelets are co-localized in cytoplasm of macrophages in the spleen. SFTSV adheres to mouse platelets and facilitates their phagocytosis.
