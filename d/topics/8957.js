Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus are the two most common forms of pemphigus. Significant morbidity and mortality can occur as a result of complications of these diseases and their treatments.</p><p>Systemic glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy for pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, and are usually highly effective for obtaining control of disease. Nonsteroidal immunomodulatory agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> commonly are prescribed in conjunction with systemic glucocorticoids in an attempt to minimize the risk for adverse effects of long-term, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. Emerging data suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, an agent traditionally reserved for refractory pemphigus, is also beneficial for the initial treatment of this disease. Other interventions, including intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), immunoadsorption, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, are typically reserved for patients with refractory disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-refractory-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of refractory pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial management of pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus will be reviewed here. The management of refractory pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, the pathogenesis and diagnosis of pemphigus, and the diagnosis and management of paraneoplastic pemphigus are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-refractory-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of refractory pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pemphigus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pemphigus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-pemphigus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic pemphigus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73755020\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although pemphigus vulgaris typically presents as a more severe disorder than pemphigus foliaceus due to the common presence of both mucosal and cutaneous involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60749%7EDERM%2F57313\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60749 graphicRef57313 \">picture 1A-B</a>), both disorders can lead to significant morbidity. Oral mucosal involvement, which occurs in almost all patients with pemphigus vulgaris, usually is accompanied by severe pain, and may lead to poor alimentation resulting in weight loss and malnutrition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56333%7EDERM%2F57924%7EDERM%2F77462\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56333 graphicRef57924 graphicRef77462 \">picture 2A-C</a>). In addition, the widespread loss of the epidermal barrier that occurs in pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus may lead to protein loss, fluid loss, electrolyte imbalances, dietary insufficiencies, increased catabolism, and increased risk for local and systemic infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53425%7EDERM%2F51868%7EDERM%2F63170%7EDERM%2F74842\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53425 graphicRef51868 graphicRef63170 graphicRef74842 \">picture 3A-D</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pemphigus#H181679718\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pemphigus&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The complications of pemphigus vulgaris can be life-threatening; it is estimated that prior to the use of systemic immunosuppressants, more than 70 percent to nearly 100 percent of patients died within one to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Pemphigus foliaceus, which is characterized by shallow blisters and involvement limited to the skin, is considered to have a better prognosis than pemphigus vulgaris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54341%7EDERM%2F60530%7EDERM%2F72419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54341 graphicRef60530 graphicRef72419 \">picture 4A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; however, progression of pemphigus foliaceus may lead to extensive involvement and similar complications.</p><p>Given the potential for severe morbidity and mortality from pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, treatment is always indicated at the time of disease onset, even for patients who initially present with only mild disease. However, treatment must be approached carefully because the therapeutic regimens utilized for pemphigus are not benign; most of the currently estimated 5 to 10 percent mortality rate from pemphigus vulgaris is considered to result from complications from treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Infections ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening opportunistic infections are common complications of the immunosuppressive regimens typically used for pemphigus therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73755027\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of treatment in pemphigus is to induce complete remission while minimizing treatment-related adverse effects. The paucity of large, high-quality prospective trials that compare the therapeutic options for this disease as well as the variability in study protocols, outcome measures, and results have made definitive conclusions on the best approach to treatment difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Adherence to the definitions for patient assessment outlined by a 2008 consensus of experts may facilitate systematic interpretation of published literature in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The approach to treatment of pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus is similar. Many studies that have evaluated therapies for pemphigus have combined patients with these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The first priority for patient management is to attain rapid disease control. This is typically achieved through the administration of systemic glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The response to systemic glucocorticoid therapy often is fast; clinically significant improvement is usually evident within two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H73755042\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Although systemic glucocorticoid therapy is highly effective, the high doses and long treatment periods that are needed to maintain the clinical response may lead to serious or life-threatening side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For this reason, a nonsteroidal systemic immunomodulatory medication is often used as an adjunct to systemic glucocorticoid therapy in an attempt to minimize glucocorticoid consumption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H816078051\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab and prednisone'</a> below and <a href=\"#H950683\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal adjuvant therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, an agent traditionally reserved for refractory pemphigus, to a systemic glucocorticoid appears to allow for use of lower cumulative doses of the systemic glucocorticoid and improve treatment efficacy and safety in patients with newly diagnosed pemphigus, although additional data are necessary to clarify best practices for the use of rituximab as an initial therapy. Other drugs commonly used in conjunction with glucocorticoids include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. Among these three agents, many clinicians consider azathioprine the preferred immunosuppressant drug due to the relatively long history of use of this drug for this indication and a randomized trial that supported a glucocorticoid-sparing effect superior to mycophenolate mofetil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/10,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14-17</a>]. Cyclophosphamide is typically reserved for severe and refractory cases due to its less favorable side effect profile. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General toxicity of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-refractory-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus#H4171122147\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of refractory pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus&quot;, section on 'Cyclophosphamide'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to the initiation of nonsteroidal adjuvant agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, varies. Some clinicians routinely prescribe a nonsteroidal agent at the start of treatment with a systemic glucocorticoid or shortly after the start of glucocorticoid therapy. Other clinicians primarily begin use of these agents when disease flares occur during glucocorticoid tapering or when the response to systemic glucocorticoid monotherapy remains unsatisfactory after several weeks. Definitive conclusions on the best approach are complicated by limited and conflicting data on the glucocorticoid-sparing effects and prognostic impact of these agents. (See <a href=\"#H950683\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal adjuvant therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>Disease activity is considered under control after a period of a few weeks during which no new lesions form, the Nikolsky sign (induction of skin blistering with manual pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78514\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78514 \">picture 5</a>)) is absent, and most lesions are healed. At this point, therapy should be reduced slowly to the lowest dose that is necessary to prevent the appearance of new lesions. We taper the systemic glucocorticoid first, and then gradually reduce the dose of the adjuvant nonsteroidal agent. (See <a href=\"#H950662\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> below.)</p><p>Long-term remission after the discontinuation of therapy is the ultimate goal for patient management, though it may take some time to achieve. A French retrospective study of 134 patients with pemphigus (80 with pemphigus vulgaris, 47 with pemphigus foliaceus, and 7 with paraneoplastic pemphigus) treated with various regimens and followed for a mean of 77&plusmn;64 months found that 59 percent of patients with pemphigus vulgaris and 45 percent of patients with pemphigus foliaceus achieved complete remission off therapy (defined as the absence of new <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> established lesions while the patient was off all systemic therapy for at least two months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The mean duration of treatment prior to reaching this endpoint was 36&plusmn;39 months. Surprisingly, disease severity did not appear to influence the likelihood of complete remission off therapy in this study. Mucosal involvement and younger age (&lt;61 years) were associated with an increased chance of complete remission off treatment. Additional studies will be useful for clarifying the relevant prognostic factors for pemphigus.</p><p>Measures aimed at managing oral pain and cutaneous wounds are additional important aspects of the management of pemphigus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such measures may help to improve patient quality of life and prevent and manage secondary infection. (See <a href=\"#H73755107\" class=\"local\">'Additional measures'</a> below.)</p><p>The management of refractory pemphigus is reviewed separately.

Emerging data suggest that combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>) is an alternative initial approach that may lead to improved outcomes compared with systemic glucocorticoid monotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H3287220404\" class=\"local\">'Alternative first-line therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H950301\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951464\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Support for the use of systemic glucocorticoids as the primary treatment for pemphigus stems from randomized trials and other studies that have documented improvement in pemphigus with glucocorticoid monotherapy in the majority of patients, and extensive clinical experience with this treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/17,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20-22</a>]. As an example, in a randomized open-label trial in which 30 patients with pemphigus vulgaris were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> alone (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day), 23 of these patients (77 percent) responded to treatment and the average time to cessation of blistering was 18 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The dramatic fall in mortality from pemphigus observed after the introduction of systemic glucocorticoid therapy also supports the value of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for this indication. (See <a href=\"#H73755020\" class=\"local\">'Indications for therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H950662\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the well-accepted status of systemic glucocorticoids as the primary treatment for pemphigus, the optimum treatment regimen is not established. Oral therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> is the most common mode of glucocorticoid administration for patients with pemphigus.</p><p>Multiple regimens have been utilized for glucocorticoid therapy. The most common approach consists of treatment with around 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Alternatively, higher doses of prednisone or prednisolone (1.5 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) have been given as initial treatment.</p><p>Direct comparisons of the efficacy and safety of these approaches are limited to a small randomized trial (n = 22) that compared high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (120 to 150 mg per day) with lower doses of prednisone (45 to 60 mg per day) in patients with newly diagnosed pemphigus vulgaris (n = 19) or pemphigus foliaceus (n = 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A statistically significant difference in the time to achieve initial disease control was not detected between patients treated with the higher and lower doses; the mean times to initial disease control were 20 (range 5 to 42 days) and 24 days (range 7 to 42 days), respectively. A significant difference in the rate of adverse effects also was not detected.</p><p>Given the lack of evidence that treatment with higher doses or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> leads to better patient outcomes, most clinicians, including ourselves, initiate therapy with doses ranging from 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. If the clinical response is insufficient, we consider a rapid increase in dose up to a maximum of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day.</p><p>In most patients treated with systemic glucocorticoid therapy, cessation of blistering takes place within two to three weeks and full disease control is achieved within six to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Once the disease activity is under control, glucocorticoid tapering should begin, with the goal of reaching the lowest dose needed to keep the disease under control. The ultimate goal is to withdraw all treatment.</p><p>The optimal method of tapering glucocorticoids in patients with pemphigus has not been determined. Thus, approaches to glucocorticoid tapering vary. Our approach for a 70 kg adult is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once no new lesions have formed for seven days, we reduce <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> from 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day to 0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If <strong>at least seven days</strong> have elapsed since the first dose reduction and no new lesions have formed, we reduce the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If <strong>at least 14 days</strong> have elapsed since the reduction to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day and no new lesions have formed for at least one week, we reduce the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> to 30 mg per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thereafter, we continue dose reductions in a stepwise manner with at least 14 days between each reduction and continue the requirement that no new lesions form within seven days prior to the next reduction.

However, emerging data indicate that combination therapy with rituximab and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> can be an effective initial treatment for pemphigus that permits use of reduced doses of prednisone and is associated with lower rates of serious side effects compared with higher-dose, longer-term prednisone monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-pemphigus-vulgaris-and-pemphigus-foliaceus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The approach to the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus is similar. (See <a href=\"#H73755020\" class=\"local\">'Indications for therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H73755027\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus are limited; few high quality randomized trials of therapies of this disorder have been performed, resulting in uncertainty about the efficacy of some therapies. Thus, the approach to treatment has been largely guided by limited data and the clinical experience of expert dermatologists. (See <a href=\"#H73755027\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic glucocorticoids are very effective for the treatment of pemphigus. For patients with pemphigus, we recommend initiating treatment with an oral glucocorticoid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Most centers initiate treatment at a dose between 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> per day. We begin treatment with 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of oral prednisone per day. Alternatively, patients may be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and a reduced dose of oral prednisone (0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day). Combination therapy with rituximab and prednisone has been associated with reduced rates of severe adverse events compared with prednisone monotherapy. The high cost of rituximab may limit the use of this regimen in some settings. (See <a href=\"#H73755042\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3287220404\" class=\"local\">'Alternative first-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged treatment with high doses of a systemic glucocorticoid is not desired due to the potential for serious adverse effects. Nonsteroidal agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil are frequently used in an attempt to reduce dependence on systemic glucocorticoids.
