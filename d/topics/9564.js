One reason for this difference is that young children are relatively protected from the mechanical forces that lead to facial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As they age, they participate in activities that increase the risk of exposure to such forces (eg, falls from height, sports, bicycle riding, etc). In addition, certain features of the immature craniofacial skeleton render it relatively resistant to fracture.</p><p>This topic will discuss the evaluation and treatment of jaw fractures in children. Jaw fractures in adults and dental trauma in children are discussed separately.

In addition, the force of impact usually is absorbed by the forehead or skull rather than the face because the ratio of cranial to facial volume is greater in infants than in adults (8:1 versus 2:1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The incidence of mandibular fractures is lowest in children younger than five years of age (1.2 per 100,000), and peaks between 16 and 20 years of age (26.5 per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Mandibular fractures occur with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The typical mechanisms of injury include motor vehicle and bicycle crashes, sports injuries, child abuse, fights, and falls from height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/2,11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11-16</a>].

Associated injuries are more common among younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>] because of the degree of force necessary to fracture their relatively stable mandible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] and because of the mechanism of injury (eg, motor vehicle crashes).

High condylar fractures may cause ear pain after facial trauma and may require coronal computed tomography (CT) scan of the temporomandibular joint for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Fractures of the condyle may be missed clinically and radiographically when the child presents with normal occlusion and normal mandibular movement, or with a chin laceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/3,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20,21</a>].

The lines of fracture tend to be long and oblique, running from the upper border of the mandible downward and forward. Single body fractures, particularly those lateral to the symphysis, often are associated with contralateral condylar fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mandible fractures usually are diagnosed with panoramic radiographs (Panorex) or computed tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The panoramic view (Panorex) displays complete mandibular anatomy, including the condyles and the upper and lower teeth and is the initial study of choice. However, it requires that the child be seated in a steady upright position. This position may not be attainable in a young or severely injured child. Computed tomography is used when other midface fractures are suspected or when panoramic radiographs cannot be obtained in the severely injured or uncooperative child, are not available, or suggest temporomandibular joint dislocation or the presence of condylar fracture fragments.</p><p>Plain radiographs in multiple views provide a reasonable alternative if panoramic radiograph or computed tomography is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/17,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,27,28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Towne <span class=\"nowrap\">(anterior/posterior)</span> view is specific for the condyles.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lateral oblique projection displays the angle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoral projections display dentoalveolar fractures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mandibular fractures in children heal rapidly because of the osteogenic capacity of the immature skeleton. Usually, only two to three weeks are necessary for stabilization of the fracture segments. The management of children with mandibular fractures should be directed by a plastic or oral-maxillofacial surgeon.</p><p>The treatment of mandibular fractures varies depending upon the site of the fracture and the age of the child. Successful immobilization with intermaxillary fixation requires teeth that are firmly supported in the alveolar bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>]. The degree of support varies by age (and stage of dental development) as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 to 2 years &ndash; There is little dentition to immobilize the mandible.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2 to 4 years &ndash; The deciduous teeth can provide support.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5 to 8 years &ndash; The deciduous molars can be used for support.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>9 to 11 years &ndash; Permanent molars and incisors can be used for support.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&gt;11 years &ndash; The dentition supports fixation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several considerations in the management of childhood mandibular fractures that are based upon the rapid healing and remodeling ability of the facial bones of children are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The facial bones should be stabilized within five days of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Other methods of closed reduction include intermaxillary fixation, which incorporates arch bars or other means of interdental wiring, and maxillomandibular fixation. Mandibular fractures with gross separation are treated with intraoral open reduction, extraoral open reduction, or external pin fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Unilateral condylar fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have unilateral condylar fractures and no associated malocclusion are treated with analgesia, a liquid to soft diet, and observation for one to two weeks. They should have follow-up within one to two weeks; radiographs should be obtained at the time of follow-up.</p><p>Children who have open bite deformities with retrusion of the mandible and limitation of movement or malocclusion are treated with 7 to 10 days of immobilization (by intermaxillary fixation or maxillomandibular fixation) followed by guiding elastics and movement exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/6,17,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17,25</a>]. Children who have condylar fractures that burst into the glenoid fossa are treated with early immobilization, aspiration, and intraarticular steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilateral condylar fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of bilateral condylar fractures, with or without an associated fracture of the symphysis, can be difficult. The goal of treatment is to overcome the loss of mandibular height that can cause Class II dental malocclusion (eg, the mandibular molars and canines are behind the maxillary first molars and canines) or bilateral open bite. It can be effectively accomplished through the use of splints that have an increased posterior height to overcome the lost vertical dimension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Fractures of the symphysis, body, and angle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of symphyseal and parasymphyseal fractures of the mandible ranges from observation to open reduction with rigid fixation. These injuries usually are treated conservatively because of the risk of injury to unerupted tooth buds and the remodeling potential from subsequent growth. Open reduction with fixation is reserved for severely displaced or comminuted fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Fractures of the body and angle of the mandible often are incomplete in children; occlusion and jaw movement are unaffected. These incomplete fractures frequently are treated with soft diet and analgesia for one to two weeks. Follow-up should occur within one to two weeks; radiographs should be obtained at the time of follow-up.</p><p>The treatment for displaced fractures of the body or angle depends upon the degree of distraction and the dentition. Intermaxillary fixation usually is adequate, but open reduction and internal fixation may be necessary. Miniplates or microplates that are necessary for intermaxillary fixation should be placed on the inferior border of the mandible, as far away from the unerupted tooth buds as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complications of mandibular fractures include growth disturbance with facial asymmetry, malocclusion, and poor mastication, osteomyelitis, tooth bud damage, temporomandibular joint syndrome, salivary disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nonunion occurs rarely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. Open reduction is a risk for tooth bud damage. Condylar fracture is a risk for growth disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective review, 88 children with mandibular fractures were followed between 2 and 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of children, who were injured between age 4 and 11, required corrective surgery for facial growth disturbances. In contrast, children who were injured before age 4 or after age 12 years rarely required such surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Condylar fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All children with condylar fractures, and particularly those who fracture the condyle before they reach five years of age, must have careful long-term follow-up with a plastic or oral-maxillofacial surgeon (including radiographs) because of the potential for growth deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/15,25,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,25,31</a>]. Follow-up should begin within one week of the injury and continue yearly until the mandible has completed growth (ie, age 19 years). Facial asymmetry after condylar fractures improves with time in 48 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Condylar fractures that burst into the glenoid fossae can be complicated by hemarthrosis, intracapsular hemorrhage, and ankylosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Condylar radiographs were obtained in 37 children with condylar fractures an average of four years after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Incomplete remodeling and asymmetry in the height of the ramus were observed in approximately 50 percent of the fractures and 80 percent of the fractures with dislocations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Ankylosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Temporomandibular ankylosis, the inability to open the jaw more than 5 mm between the central incisors, is a complication of condyle fractures. It causes the mandible to deviate toward the ankylosed joint when the jaw is opened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Ankylosis can be fibrous or osseous in nature. It occurs in patients who were excessively immobilized as well as those who were not immobilized. Ankylosis may cause facial asymmetry in the growing child if it is not surgically corrected immediately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Even after surgical correction, control of growth in the reconstructed <span class=\"nowrap\">ramus/condyle</span> unit may be unpredictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1994707\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaw fractures most commonly occur in older teenagers. Condylar fractures are most frequent in children under 10 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56004\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56004 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma to the head, face, neck, and airway are important injuries associated with jaw fractures in children. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Associated injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings of jaw fractures include malocclusion, pain at the temporomandibular joint, ecchymosis of the floor of the mouth, difficulty and pain in opening or closing the mouth, and inability to hold a tongue depressor between the teeth. Chin lacerations are also frequently present. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaw fractures are best detected by panoramic plain films (Panorex) of the mandible. If panoramic plain films cannot be performed, plain films, including Towne, lateral oblique, and intraoral projection views are the best alternative imaging method. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, the facial bones should be stabilized within five days of injury. The treatment of mandibular fractures varies depending upon the site of the fracture and the age of the child (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most pediatric mandible fractures can be adequately treated with closed reduction and intermaxillary fixation by a maxillofacial surgeon if dentition allows. Immobilization is usually maintained for no longer than three to four weeks. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children with unilateral condylar fractures and no malocclusion are initially treated with analgesia and a liquid to soft diet with follow-up in one to two weeks with an oromaxillofacial surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Unilateral condylar fractures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bilateral condylar fractures are typically treated with special splints. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Bilateral condylar fractures'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nondisplaced, incomplete fractures of the symphysis, body, or angle with no malocclusion are typically treated with a soft diet and analgesia for two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Fractures of the symphysis, body, and angle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Displaced fractures of the symphysis, body, or angle typically require open reduction and internal fixation. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Fractures of the symphysis, body, and angle'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/jaw-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Azevedo AB, Trent RB, Ellis A.
