As an example, nationally representative surveys estimate approximately 17 percent of high school seniors in the United States had used prescription opioids in their lifetime for medical purposes and approximately 13 percent had used prescription opioids for nonmedical purposes<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 8 percent of children between the ages of 14 to 20 surveyed at a university based emergency department had reported nonmedical prescription opioid use<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, between 1994 and 2007, the proportion of ambulatory visits where an adolescent or young adult was prescribed a controlled medication nearly doubled<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Lastly, per the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), opioids represent approximately 1 to 2 percent of all adolescent substance abuse treatment admissions and in 2008, 63 percent of these were due to prescription opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Information on worldwide opioid use in adolescents is more limited but includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2007 survey of 2914 Canadian students aged 12 to 19 showed that approximately 20 percent had lifetime nonmedical use of prescription opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2010 nationwide survey of students in England aged 11 to 15 showed approximately 1 percent lifetime opioid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated number of patients (of all ages) in opioid substitution treatment programs in the European Union has increased from approximately 450,000 in 2003 to approximately 700,000 in 2010, which is believed to be largely due to increased abuse of prescription opioids rather than heroin abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>According to the United Nations, opioid use among all ages has been rising in Asia since 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30523602\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tolerance is defined as a decrease of an individual&rsquo;s response to given drug as the drug is administered repeatedly or for prolonged periods. A withdrawal state may occur as the body adapts to higher and higher drug concentrations. Opioid withdrawal symptoms are thought to primarily involve changes in the locus ceruleus (LC). Opioids inhibit the activity of LC neurons. When opioids are continuously present, increased activity of the LC neurons compensates for the inhibition. When opioids or their activity are abruptly removed, the increased activity of the LC neurons results in withdrawal symptoms<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The mesolimbic system is also important in mediating withdrawal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS OF OPIOID WITHDRAWAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tolerance and physical and psychologic dependence on opioids usually occur after three weeks of daily usage. Higher tolerance is created as the user decreases the interval and increases the dose to achieve euphoria. Tolerance does not develop to the following physiologic effects: miosis and constipation.</p><p>Heroin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydromorphone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methadone</a> have great addictive potential. Heroin provides a &quot;rush&quot; because it easily crosses the blood brain barrier and can be used by multiple routes. Hydromorphone is almost 100 times more potent than is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">codeine</a> for analgesic effect. Methadone is long-acting. Codeine, a prescription drug that must be ingested orally, has weaker analgesic effects and a lower addictive potential.</p><p>The discontinuation of opioids leads to a constellation of withdrawal symptoms known as the abstinence syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78321\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78321 \">table 1</a>). The severity of the abstinence syndrome depends upon the type and frequency of the drug used. The abstinence syndrome usually is elicited if opioid use is discontinued after several months of daily usage.</p><p>Withdrawal symptoms occur in stages, depending upon the time of the last dose and the elimination time of the drug, the typical findings are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three to four hours after blood levels decline &ndash; Drug craving, anxiety, fear of withdrawal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eight to 14 hours &ndash; Anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, yawning, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, diaphoresis, stomach cramps, and mydriasis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One to three days &ndash; Tremor, muscle spasms, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, fever, chills, and piloerection</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1692947\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical features of opioid withdrawal in adolescents are similar to those seen in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81045 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12678872\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In individuals with opioid use disorder, opioid withdrawal may begin immediately after receiving an antagonist, or after cessation of use. Partial agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">buprenorphine</a>) and agonist-antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentazocine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pentazocine</a>) can also produce withdrawal, so for the purpose of this review, the term &quot;antagonist&quot; will be discussed in relation to these drugs as well.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of withdrawal may begin 6 to 12 hours after the last dose of a short-acting opioid and 24 to 48 hours after cessation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methadone</a>. Withdrawal symptoms typically peak within 24 to 48 hours of onset, but may persist for several days with short-acting agents and up to two weeks with methadone.</p><p>Patients experiencing opioid withdrawal may complain of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphoria and restlessness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhinorrhea and lacrimation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myalgias and arthralgias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea</p><p/><p>Some or all of these symptoms may be present, and the severity depends on the individual's tolerance to opioids, the continued presence of opioid in the serum and end organs, and the duration of time over which the withdrawal has occurred. As an example, a person who is tolerant to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methadone</a> who was administered two milligrams of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naloxone</a> intravenously would experience much more severe symptoms than someone taking 10 mg of methadone daily who stopped abruptly (ie, &quot;cold turkey&quot;). A thorough history should ascertain why the patient discontinued opioid use to ensure there is not another underlying medical condition that precluded them from obtaining the drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12678879\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioid withdrawal is characterized by mydriasis (pupillary dilation), yawning, increased bowel sounds, and piloerection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81045\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81045 \">table 2</a>). If the patient is in severe distress, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate may be increased. Hypotension may be present in the setting of volume depletion from vomiting and diarrhea. Temperature is normal, and with the exception of very severe cases, mental status is preserved.</p><p>Most patients in opioid withdrawal have good insight into their problem, and the diagnosis is usually established by history alone. When present, the findings of yawning and lacrimation are helpful because of their specificity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693162\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioid withdrawal may appear similar to other withdrawal or intoxication syndromes. However, significant tachycardia or hypertension is rare. Many patients in opioid withdrawal have a pulse and blood pressure within normal limits. Although some in opioid withdrawal have a tachycardia that reflects their agitation, discomfort, or hypovolemia, only a small minority of patients manifest both hypertension and tachycardia. When present, these signs are almost always a result of a surge in catecholamines from iatrogenically-induced withdrawal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-withdrawal-in-the-emergency-setting#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid withdrawal in the emergency setting&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693195\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethanol withdrawal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ethanol withdrawal may present with a broad spectrum of severity and vital sign abnormalities. It is much more likely to cause tachycardia and hypertension than opioid withdrawal. In contrast to opioid withdrawal, seizures and altered mental status may be prominent.</p><p>A rapid overview of moderate and severe ethanol withdrawal is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64745\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64745 \">table 3</a>).

Unlike typical opioid withdrawal, sedative-hypnotic withdrawal may cause seizures and hyperthermia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benzodiazepine poisoning and withdrawal&quot;, section on 'Withdrawal'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693211\"><span class=\"h2\">Sympathomimetic intoxication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cocaine, amphetamine, or other sympathomimetic intoxication may produce mydriasis, agitation, tachycardia, and hypertension, but these findings are usually much more severe than occur in opioid withdrawal. Severe sympathomimetic intoxication is associated with seizures and hyperthermia which is not seen with typical opioid withdrawal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methamphetamine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-amphetamine-and-synthetic-cathinone-bath-salt-intoxication#H350266282\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute amphetamine and synthetic cathinone (&quot;bath salt&quot;) intoxication&quot;, section on 'Clinical features of overdose'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693219\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholinergic poisoning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poisoning with cholinergic agents (eg, organophosphates or carbamates) may cause diarrhea and vomiting, but can be distinguished from opioid withdrawal by the presence of altered mental status, bradycardia, and salivation. In patients with organophosphate poisoning, fasciculations, muscle weakness, and seizures may occur, which would further differentiate that clinical entity from opiate withdrawal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=organophosphate-and-carbamate-poisoning#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>A rapid overview for the treatment of organophosphate and carbamate poisoning is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63540 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE MANAGEMENT OF OPIOID WITHDRAWAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rapid overview of the treatment of opioid withdrawal is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68306\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68306 \">table 5</a>). In the emergency setting, administration of any pure opioid agonist will be able to abort abstinence symptoms, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a> may also reduce symptom severity. The long acting opioid agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methadone</a> is commonly used to eliminate withdrawal symptoms and to provide a means for weaning. Short-acting drugs (eg, clonidine) are preferred when the patient is in a monitored setting; long-acting agents (eg, methadone) are more convenient to use and are preferred in medically stable patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Methadone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Methadone</a>, a long-acting opioid with a half-life of 24 to 36 hours, is the cornerstone of medical therapy for opioid addiction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54978 \">table 6</a>). Its use relieves opioid craving and withdrawal symptoms and when given in sufficient doses, blocks the euphoric effects of opioids. Methadone detoxification involves the use of tapering doses of methadone to achieve a smooth transition from opioid use to a drug-free state.</p><p>A method of treating opioid withdrawal symptoms using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methadone</a> without causing over-sedation or severe patient discomfort is discussed in detail elsewhere.

It decreases withdrawal symptoms by blocking the release of norepinephrine. It can be used with methadone when methadone is tapered below 15 mg. In higher doses (greater than 1.2 mg per day), clonidine can cause dry mouth, sedation, orthostasis, and constipation. Patients taking clonidine should be monitored for hypotension.
