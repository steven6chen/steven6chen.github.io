This sometimes makes the muscle tear. Another term for a muscle strain is a &quot;pulled muscle.&quot;</p><p>A muscle strain can happen during an accident or exercise. Muscles that are commonly strained include those in the back, neck, and back of the leg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276646822\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a muscle strain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms happen in the area of the muscle strain and can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle spasm or tightness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness or being unable to move the muscle</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276646837\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have a muscle strain by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>Some people need tests. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor or nurse might order an imaging test such as an ultrasound or MRI scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276646852\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a muscle strain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A muscle strain usually gets better on its own, but it can take days to weeks to heal completely.</p><p>To help your symptoms get better, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest your muscle and avoid movements or activities that cause pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice the area &ndash; You can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the painful muscle every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after the injury. Some people find it helpful to ice up to 2 days after an injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrap your muscle with an elastic bandage, other type of wrap, or fabric &quot;sleeve&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83481\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83481 \">picture 1</a>) &ndash; This helps support your muscle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise the muscle above the level of your heart (if possible) &ndash; For example, you can prop your leg up on pillows. This is helpful only for the first few days after an injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicine to reduce the pain and swelling &ndash; If you have a lot of pain or a severe muscle strain, your doctor will prescribe a strong pain medicine. If your strain is not severe, you can take an over-the-counter medicine such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p>After your pain gets better, your doctor or nurse will recommend that you gently stretch and exercise your muscle. Stretches and exercises can help strengthen your muscles and keep them from getting too stiff.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will show you stretches and exercises to do. Or he or she will have you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert).</p><p>It's important to let your muscle heal before you play sports or do other activities that use the muscle again. If you don't let your muscle heal, you are likely to injure it again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276646867\"><span class=\"h1\">Can a muscle strain be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can help prevent a muscle strain by taking time to warm up your muscles before you exercise. You can do this by walking or doing another light activity. If you are not sure how to warm up before exercising, ask your doctor, nurse, or physical therapist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276646882\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=whiplash-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Whiplash (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Knee pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-pain-in-older-people-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip pain in older people (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=groin-strain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Groin strain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hamstring-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hamstring injury (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Knee pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Neck pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
