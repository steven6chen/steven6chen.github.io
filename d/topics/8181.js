Although the swelling is self-limited and resolves in two to five days without treatment, laryngeal involvement may cause fatal asphyxiation.</p><p>The pathogenesis and diagnosis of hereditary forms of angioedema will be reviewed here. The clinical features, precipitating factors, and treatment of this disorder are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Treatment of acute attacks&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: General care and long-term prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20554842\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The swelling (ie, angioedema, sometimes called &quot;giant&quot; swelling) that occurs in HAE results from excessive production of bradykinin, a potent vasodilatory mediator. Bradykinin also has important vascular permeability-enhancing effects. During episodes of angioedema in patients with HAE, plasma bradykinin levels have been shown to be sevenfold higher than normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In bradykinin-mediated angioedema, histamine and other mast cell mediators are not directly involved, which explains the lack of response to antihistamines and distinguishes this form of angioedema from the histamine-mediated angioedema that is seen in allergic reactions and urticaria.</p><p>The best characterized forms of HAE arise from deficiency or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor (C1INH). However, there are other forms of HAE in which C1INH is normal. A small but growing number of suspected pathogenic variants in genes for other proteins have been identified to explain the disease in some families, while the pathogenesis in other families remains unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3379959588\"><span class=\"h2\">Functions of C1 inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>C1 inhibitor (C1INH) is an acute-phase reactant and a member of the &quot;serpin&quot; superfamily of <strong>ser</strong>ine <strong>p</strong>rotease <strong>in</strong>hibitors. C1INH inhibits steps in the classical and lectin complement pathways, as well as of the intrinsic coagulation (contact system), fibrinolytic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and kinin-generating pathways. Within these different pathways, C1INH inhibits several plasma proteases: C1r and C1s, mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASP1 and MASP2), coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor), coagulation factor XI, plasma kallikrein, and plasmin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The function of C1INH in the kinin-generating pathway is most directly related to the pathogenesis of HAE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87451 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3663104308\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular events leading to angioedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial molecular events in the genesis of an attack are not entirely understood. Local activation of the contact system proteases factor XII and plasma prekallikrein on endothelial cell surfaces is important in initiation. The activation of factor XII, possibly by phospholipids released from damaged cells, is believed to be a leading mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Heat shock protein 90 generated during cell stress may enhance contact system activation. Activated factor XII (factor XIIa) and kallikrein catalyze the cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) by kallikrein, with release of bradykinin. C1INH normally plays a role in limiting bradykinin production by inhibiting both kallikrein and active factor XII, so when C1INH is deficient or dysfunctional, bradykinin production is relatively unchecked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87451\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87451 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>]. Plasma prekallikrein has been reported to be capable of slowly catalyzing the cleavage of HMWK independently of factor XII. However, the clinical relevance of this is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The pathologic mechanisms of this disease have proven difficult to study. An animal model of HAE was produced in knockout mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, despite profound deficiency of C1INH due to homozygous gene defects, the mice do not develop spontaneous episodes of angioedema. Instead, minor localized swellings can be induced experimentally by the local application of mustard oil (an irritant) to the animal's skin. In response to this, the animals develop abnormal increases in vascular permeability, which can be reversed either by administration of C1INH, blocking kallikrein, or blocking the bradykinin B<sub>2</sub> receptor.</p><p>C1INH deficiency or dysfunction results in low levels of complement component 4 (C4) because the C1 complex normally cleaves C4 as part of the classical complement pathway, and this is exaggerated if C1INH is deficient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56374\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56374 \">figure 2</a>). C1INH is an extremely potent inhibitor of C1r and C1s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F88955\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88955 \">table 1</a>), relative to the other proteases it inhibits, so the result of C1INH deficiency can be detected in this pathway easily as a low C4 level. Thus, low C4 is not believed to be directly related to the pathogenesis of HAE but rather just a sensitive screening test for deficiency of C1INH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20557177\"><span class=\"h2\">Subtypes and genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several types of HAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Two forms of the disorder arise from deficiency or dysfunction of C1INH (types I and II, respectively) and can be detected by abnormal complement protein levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,18</a>]. The other types of familial angioedema are characterized by normal C1INH and normal complement studies. Patients with HAE with normal C1INH are likely a heterogeneous group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F106530\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106530 \">figure 3</a>). Some patients have identifiable variants in factor XII. In 2017, two additional variants were implicated as potential causes of HAE with normal C1INH: one in the gene for angiopoietin-1 (<em>ANGPT1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] and another in the gene for plasminogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The etiology of angioedema in the remaining patients is unknown. The pathogenesis of HAE with normal C1INH is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with hereditary forms of angioedema have these defects from birth and generally present with recurrent angioedema as children or young adults. There is also an acquired form of C1INH deficiency that presents in older patients (ie, age &gt;40 years) without a family history of angioedema and is associated with underlying disorders or autoantibodies in most cases. Acquired C1INH deficiency is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20557184\"><span class=\"h3\">HAE with C1 inhibitor deficiency/dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HAE type I is due to C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency, and type II is caused by C1INH dysfunction. Together, these two disorders are called HAE with C1INH deficiency (C1INH-HAE) (MIM #106100).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I HAE accounts for 85 percent of C1INH-HAE kindreds and is characterized by reduced secretion of the C1INH protein. Upon testing, plasma <strong>protein (antigenic) and functional C1INH levels are both low</strong> and range from undetectable to less than 30 percent of normal in most patients, although levels can occasionally be between 30 and 50 percent of normal. For example, if the lower limit of a normal protein level is 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> then a patient with type I HAE would typically have a level &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. These decrements are greater than would be predicted with one intact normal allele, even though the disorder is almost always heterozygous. Possible explanations for this include increased baseline catabolism or decreased expression of the normal allele product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II HAE results from the presence of a dysfunctional C1INH protein, which is present in normal or elevated amounts. This type of HAE is found in about 15 percent of affected families. Upon testing, C1INH <strong>function is low, but</strong> <strong>protein</strong> <strong>levels are normal or elevated</strong>. Protein levels may be elevated because the defective C1INH is unable to form complexes with proteases, resulting in an increased plasma half-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4883041\"><span class=\"h4\">Inheritance patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inheritance of types I and II HAE is autosomal dominant, so the majority of affected patients have affected family members. However, approximately 25 percent of cases result from de novo mutations, so a positive family history is not required for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. Nearly all affected patients are heterozygotes with one abnormal allele, although a few patients with homozygous deficiency have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Having an abnormal C1INH allele does not result in symptoms of angioedema in all individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A Spanish study describing the establishment of an HAE disease registry illustrated this phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients with HAE were identified throughout the country, and screening was performed to detect affected family members. Up to 10 percent of individuals carrying the defective gene were asymptomatic, although this figure includes young subjects who may become symptomatic later in life. Less than 5 percent of C1INH-HAE patients above 20 years of age are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The gene for C1INH is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28-30</a>]. Nearly 300 pathogenic variants have been reported in unrelated patients with types I and II HAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31-33</a>]. An electronic database of variants is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The most common defect is single base-pair mutation, which can occur throughout the gene. Larger gene rearrangements, including partial gene deletions and duplications, account for another 20 percent of gene defects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20557198\"><span class=\"h3\">HAE with normal C1 inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other forms of HAE exist in which complement studies are normal, including C4, C1 inhibitor (C1INH) protein level, and C1INH function. The evaluation described below also applies to these disorders, with the additional consideration of genetic testing to identify one of the variants in other proteins that has been identified in this subset of patients. HAE with normal C1INH is reviewed in more detail separately.

Most patients with HAE have been given antihistamines and glucocorticoids multiple times in the past without benefit. However, if a therapeutic trial of high-dose antihistamines has not been given, this should be done if C4 is normal and there is no family history, before extensive additional complement tests are ordered (particularly if the resources to perform accurate complement studies are limited). Nonsedating H1 antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levocetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levocetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desloratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desloratadine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a>) should be given for at least one month or for a sufficient time period to appreciate a change, depending upon the patient's frequency of angioedema episodes. We start with twice the usual dose (eg, cetirizine 10 mg twice daily). If there is no improvement, we increase to four times the usual dose or add a second agent at twice the usual dose. If this does not prevent episodes of angioedema, then the evaluation for HAE can continue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. If high-dose antihistamine therapy does prevent further episodes of angioedema, then the patient has histaminergic acquired angioedema, which is far more common than HAE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F106530\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106530 \">figure 3</a>). If no cause can be found, the diagnosis is idiopathic histaminergic acquired angioedema (IH-AAE, also called idiopathic angioedema). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Recurrent, idiopathic angioedema'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1594900463\"><span class=\"h2\">Complement testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>C4 (the natural substrate for C1 esterase), C1INH protein (or &quot;antigenic&quot;) levels, and C1INH function are the critical diagnostic tests for patients with possible HAE with C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1INH-HAE). Confirmation of C1INH-HAE requires low C4 <strong>plus</strong> decreased C1INH protein or function. Two sets of complement tests should be obtained, ideally at least one month apart. Complement studies are normal in HAE associated with variants in factor XII (FXII-HAE), angiopoietin-1 (<em>ANGPT1</em>), and plasminogen, as well as HAE of unknown origin (U-HAE). The table summarizes complement results in different angioedema disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83098\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83098 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Complement tests are susceptible to laboratory error and should be performed by accredited laboratories that have demonstrated competence in these assays. In addition, clinicians should be vigilant for other sources of error:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement studies should be done with fresh or freshly frozen serum that has not been standing for more than four hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C4 and C1INH protein levels are relatively reliable. In contrast, tests of C1INH function are particularly prone to error and can be falsely low (chromogenic assay) or falsely normal (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]). If C4 is normal and C1INH function is low, the most likely explanation is laboratory error, and testing should be repeated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal range for C4 is extremely wide (from 10 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and may be reported as a concentration, absolute level, or percentage of normal. A level below 50 percent of normal is strongly suggestive of C1INH deficiency. If the C4 level is presented in mg without a percent, 25 mg would be considered a normal level (100 percent), and levels &lt;10 mg are strongly suggestive of C1INH deficiency (pathologic). Levels between 10 and 15 mg are possibly pathologic, and levels &gt;15 mg are not pathologic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement studies for diagnosis must be performed when the patient is not receiving C1INH concentrate, because it will alter results. If it has been initiated, it should be discontinued for one week before diagnostic complement studies are obtained. Patients receiving androgens will often still have low C4 and C1INH levels, but if complement results are normal, androgens should be withheld for one week and testing repeated. Therapies for HAE are discussed in detail elsewhere.

If an FXII or another specific variant is identified, then the diagnosis is HAE associated with a variant in that specific protein. The diagnosis of U-HAE is one of exclusion and requires failure of an adequate trial of high-dose nonsedating antihistamines. (See <a href=\"#H2798944909\" class=\"local\">'Trial of high-dose antihistamines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>In 90 percent or more of patients with C1INH-HAE, plasma levels of C4 are always low, even during asymptomatic periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. However, because this is not the case in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], a normal C4 level in an <strong>asymptomatic</strong> patient does not absolutely exclude disease. If clinical suspicion is high and C4 is normal when the patient is asymptomatic, C4 should be repeated during an angioedema episode.</p><p>In patients in whom clinical suspicion is high and there is <strong>no</strong> family history (or family history is unknown), complement studies are interpreted as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108543\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108543 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If C4 is low and C1INH protein level is normal, C1INH function should be measured. If function is also low, the patient has C1INH-HAE. Family history should be revisited and if truly negative, the patient has a new pathogenic variant. If C1INH function is normal, other causes of C4 consumption should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H131267546\" class=\"local\">'Low C4 levels'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If C4 and C1INH protein levels are normal, the next step in evaluation is a trial of daily high-dose antihistamines, if not already performed. In patients with idiopathic histaminergic acquired angioedema (IH-AAE), these interventions result in a dramatic decrease or complete cessation of angioedema episodes. (See <a href=\"#H2798944909\" class=\"local\">'Trial of high-dose antihistamines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If angioedema episodes continue, the patient likely has either HAE associated with a specific variant or idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema, depending upon whether an FXII, angiopoietin-1 (<em>ANGPT1</em>), or plasminogen variant is identified. FXII-HAE is primarily seen in women in whom symptoms are mainly estrogen-related. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If both C4 and C1INH protein level are low, then C1q should be measured. A low C1q level suggests acquired C1INH deficiency, which usually presents in patients &gt;40 years of age with underlying hematologic or lymphoproliferative disorders. Any patient with low C4, low C1INH protein level, and low C1q should be evaluated for an underlying hematologic or lymphoproliferative disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-management-and-prognosis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Associated disorders'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If C1q is normal, then further evaluation depends upon the age at which symptoms began. If symptoms began before age 30, the most likely explanation is a new mutation causing C1INH-HAE. If symptoms began after age 40, acquired C1INH deficiency is the most likely explanation (C1q is normal in 30 percent of cases), and the patient should be evaluated for an underlying hematologic or lymphoproliferative disorder. Patients between 30 and 40 years of age could have either disorder, and genotyping of the C1INH gene (<em>SERPING1</em>) should be considered for definitive diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258736301\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of types I and II HAE is based upon a suggestive clinical history and physical findings during episodes, combined with consistent results from at least two sets of complement studies. Ideally, these should be separated in time by one month or more. A family history of angioedema strongly supports the diagnosis, but it is not required, since approximately one-quarter of patients have de novo mutations. Genetic testing is not required to confirm the diagnosis of HAE with C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1INH-HAE) in adults.</p><p/><p>The diagnosis of HAE associated with variants in factor XII (FXII-HAE), angiopoietin-1, or plasminogen is based upon suggestive clinical history and physical findings during episodes, normal complement studies, and a positive family history. Genetic studies confirm the diagnosis and is the only way to make a definitive diagnosis if the family history is negative.</p><p>The diagnosis of HAE of unknown origin (U-HAE) requires a suggestive clinical history and physical findings during episodes, normal complement studies, a positive family history, and demonstrated lack of effectiveness of a prolonged trial of high-dose nonsedating antihistamines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20554401\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTING FAMILY MEMBERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a diagnosis of HAE has been made, testing of the patient's children, parents, and siblings (if parents carry the mutation) should be strongly encouraged. The recommended studies are the same as those used for screening: complement component 4 (C4), C1 inhibitor (C1INH) antigenic levels, and C1INH functional levels.</p><p>In C1INH-HAE, approximately 25 percent of cases result from de novo mutations, so affected descendants are usually but not always identified. C1INH-HAE does not skip generations, although it can occasionally appear to do so if affected individuals are asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1679998557\"><span class=\"h2\">Accuracy of testing in infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both C1INH levels and function are difficult to interpret in children younger than one year of age because C1INH levels are normally 30 to 50 percent lower than adult levels, even in the absence of disease. Both false-positives and false-negatives may occur in infants screened in the manner suggested for adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. C4 levels are also variable in this age group. Genetic testing is occasionally performed in infants under the age of one year if a definitive diagnosis is required and the disease-causing mutation in the family is known. In most cases, testing is simply postponed until the infant is older, and the diagnosis can be made using complement studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of disorders share clinical or laboratory features of HAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous and/or laryngeal swelling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laryngeal swelling <strong>without urticaria</strong> can also result from non-bradykinin-mediated processes. These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis</strong> &ndash; Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis can involve cutaneous and laryngeal swelling. There are often associated symptoms affecting multiple organ systems simultaneously, such as urticaria, wheezing, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension. The onset of allergic reactions is rapidly progressive or even explosive, and the patient can often identify a precipitating event, such as a meal, an insect sting, or administration of a new medication. Thus, compared with attacks of HAE, allergic reactions are generally more rapid in onset, involve multiple organ systems, and can include urticaria and wheezing (which are never seen in attacks of HAE).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If laryngeal edema is present, airway assessment and management must always take precedence over any other treatments. If anaphylaxis is a diagnostic possibility, the patient should be given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> without delay. Complement studies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serum tryptase levels should be obtained after the patient is stabilized. Any elevation in serum tryptase is consistent with anaphylaxis, although a normal level does not exclude it.

Contact dermatitis can cause dramatic swelling of the facial and periorbital skin when it develops in response to cosmetic or topical pharmaceuticals. Microvesiculation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deep erythema of the skin can help distinguish this from complement-mediated angioedema. Patients with contact dermatitis may complain of pain and burning of the skin. Poison ivy can cause a similar clinical picture, but linear patterns of vesiculations are often detectable, and pruritus is prominent. Contact dermatitis responds to oral glucocorticoids and does not involve complement abnormalities.

Early stages of both scleredema and systemic sclerosis can present as swelling. However, the swelling of these conditions is persistent.

It is predominantly mediated by bradykinin, a potent vasodilatory peptide, although other mediators may be involved. (See <a href=\"#H20554842\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several types of HAE:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Types I and II result from deficiency or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor (C1INH), respectively, and are collectively called HAE with C1INH deficiency (C1INH-HAE). C1INH plays a role in regulating bradykinin production. However, the precise mechanisms by which these defects predispose to episodic angioedema are not understood. Complement studies are abnormal in C1INH-HAE. In at least 90 percent of patients with C1INH-HAE, plasma levels of complement component 4 (C4) are always low, even during asymptomatic periods, and thus, C4 is a good screening test. The inheritance pattern of C1INH-HAE is autosomal dominant, although 25 percent of cases result from de novo mutations, and occasional affected individuals may be asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H20557184\" class=\"local\">'HAE with C1 inhibitor deficiency/dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The other types of HAE are characterized by normal complement studies. At least four disorders have been defined: HAE associated with variants in the genes for factor XII (FXII-HAE), angiopoietin-1 (<em>ANGPT1</em>), or plasminogen and HAE of unknown etiology (U-HAE). (See <a href=\"#H20557198\" class=\"local\">'HAE with normal C1 inhibitor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for screening for HAE include recurrent angioedema without urticaria, unexplained recurrent episodic abdominal pain, a family history of angioedema, any episode of unexplained laryngeal edema, and a low C4 level. (See <a href=\"#H4237570347\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect HAE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HAE (of any type) do not respond to antihistamine therapy. Most patients with HAE have been given antihistamines and glucocorticoids multiple times in the past without benefit. However, if a therapeutic trial of high-dose antihistamines has not been given, this should be done in cases where there is no evidence of a deficiency or defect in C1INH and no suggestive family history. (See <a href=\"#H2798944909\" class=\"local\">'Trial of high-dose antihistamines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to evaluation and testing depends upon whether the clinical suspicion is low or high because this determines how extensive complement testing should be. When clinical suspicion is high, the evaluation is further influenced by the presence or absence of a family history of angioedema. (See <a href=\"#H1817145327\" class=\"local\">'Algorithmic approach to evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If clinical suspicion is low, C4 alone is an adequate screening test. (See <a href=\"#H705635\" class=\"local\">'Low clinical suspicion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If clinical suspicion is high and there is a family history of angioedema, we suggest one approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108544\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108544 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If clinical suspicion is high and there is <strong>no</strong> family history, we suggest a somewhat different approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108543\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108543 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a patient has been diagnosed with HAE, screening for the disorder should be offered to family members.
