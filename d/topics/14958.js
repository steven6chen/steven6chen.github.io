The regulation of the complement system will be reviewed here. In order to fully comprehend the functions of the various regulatory proteins, it is helpful to be familiar with the complement pathways, which are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLEMENT REGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly one-half of all complement proteins serve a regulatory function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The goal of regulation is to prevent complement damage to normal host tissue (inappropriate or wrong target) and fluid-phase activation (no target) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Deficiencies of control proteins lead to excessive complement activation and significant morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regulatory proteins inhibit the system by destabilizing activation complexes and by mediating specific proteolysis of activation-derived fragments.

C1 inhibitor, a member of the &quot;serpin&quot; superfamily of serine protease inhibitors, binds to each C1r and C1s subcomponent of the C1 complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72648\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72648 \">figure 1</a>). This causes their dissociation and release from C1q, which is commonly attached to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in an immune complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>C1 inhibitor performs a similar function in the lectin pathway. This pathway has an activation scheme similar to that of the classical complement pathway, but lectins substitute for antibodies and lectin-associated proteases replace C1r and C1s. The lectins bind sugar residues on microbial surfaces. Mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs) subsequently cleave C4 and C2. C1 inhibitor blocks the active sites of these MASPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-the-complement-system#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of the complement system&quot;, section on 'Lectin pathway deficiencies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mannose-binding lectin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>C1 inhibitor has other biologic functions, in addition to control of complement activation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C1 inhibitor regulates three other interrelated pathways: the coagulation (contact), fibrinolytic, and kinin-generating systems. The role of C1 inhibitor in limiting the generation of kinins is central to the pathogenesis of hereditary angioedema, a condition caused by a deficit or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor. Hereditary angioedema is reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The effect was also demonstrated with inactivated C1 inhibitor, suggesting that inhibition of the complement system was not the primary mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The use of C1 inhibitor therapy in human sepsis has been studied primarily in lab-based studies and in anecdotal reports and small, randomized trials in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

This process, called cofactor activity, requires collaboration with the plasma-serine protease known as factor I and a cofactor protein, such as MCP or factor H.</p><p/><p>These widely expressed membrane regulators inhibit complement on host tissue, while the plasma inhibitors primarily prevent activation in the fluid phase. However, at sites of injury, the plasma inhibitors can interact with structures, such as the exposed basement membrane. Anionic or heparin-binding sites in factor H and C4BP allow those plasma regulators, in essence, to act like a membrane protein at inflammatory sites and in areas of cellular injury (eg, apoptotic and necrotic cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Regulatory proteins are a target of pathogen inactivation or highjacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Indeed, CD46 has been called a pathogen magnet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Regulator deficiencies are associated with the diseases age-related macular degeneration, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, C3 glomerulopathy (C3G; formerly dense deposit disease), and complement hyperactivation, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (CHAPLE) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Control in plasma prevents diffusion from the activation site. S protein (also known as vitronectin) controls fluid-phase MAC by binding to a site on the C5b-7 complex, thereby preventing its attachment to cell membranes. MACs that deposit on self-tissue are inhibited by CD59 (also called protectin, membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis, or MAC inhibitory factor). This widely expressed glycolipid-anchored membrane protein has binding sites for both C8 and C9 and thereby inhibits the final steps of MAC assembly.</p><p>A deficiency of CD59 is a common finding in adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The deficiency is caused by a mutation in the <em>PIGA</em> gene (<strong>p</strong>hosphatidyl<strong>i</strong>nositol <strong>g</strong>lycan anchor biosynthesis, class <strong>A</strong>) that prevents the formation via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, such that CD59 is not expressed on the cell surface. This results in an increased sensitivity to lysis. Additionally, several cases with loss-of-function CD59 deficiency have been described with all patients (12 of 12) demonstrating neurologic symptoms, 92 percent (11 of 12) recurrent peripheral neuropathy, 50 percent (6 of 12) with recurrent strokes, and 8 percent (1 of 12) with retinal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a treatment trial using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> for three years on four patients, no strokes occurred, and nonpermanent neurologic insults were resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The resulting anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, and C5a) are inactivated by a plasma enzyme called carboxypeptidase-N that removes the carboxyl-terminal arginyl residue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLEMENT RECEPTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many host cells, especially human peripheral blood cells, possess receptors for complement activation fragments that promote the adherence and ingestion of micro-organisms and immune complexes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58974 \">table 2</a>). Upon engagement, these receptors, which are expressed on most inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, induce cellular responses that trigger inflammatory and immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/6,13,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Complement receptor 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most peripheral blood cells express complement receptor 1 (also called CR1, CD35, <span class=\"nowrap\">C3b/C4b,</span> or immune adherence receptor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. CR1 plays a critical role in the clearance of C4b- and C3b-coated particles (eg, immune complexes) on which the complement system has been activated. Deposition of C3b and C4b on a target is particularly efficacious in promoting attachment to cells bearing complement receptors. This phenomenon is known as &quot;immune adherence.&quot;</p><p>Erythrocytes express approximately 500 copies of CR1 per cell. This allows the erythrocyte to bind intravascular immune complexes and then serve as a vehicle (taxi) to transport immune complexes to the liver and spleen. Hepatic and splenic macrophages then &quot;clear&quot; such immune complexes by &quot;stripping&quot; them from the erythrocyte, destroying the antigen (often viruses or bacteria), and facilitating an immune response (antigen presentation). The erythrocyte may then return to the circulation for another round of immune complex clearance.</p><p>The function of CR1 depends in part upon the type of cell on which it is expressed. The primary function of CR1 on erythrocytes is to clear circulating immune complexes. In comparison, CR1 on neutrophils and monocytes binds C3b- or C4b-bearing immune complexes, resulting in a cellular response that often includes internalization and digestion. In addition, CR1 is expressed on B lymphocytes, a subset of T lymphocytes, and on follicular dendritic cells where it facilitates the localization of complement-bearing antigens to lymphoid follicles. On peripheral blood cells, CR1 is primarily an immune adherence receptor. It also serves a regulatory role by preventing further complement activation and by converting C3b to hemolytically inactive fragments (iC3b and C3dg), which then serve as ligands for additional complement receptors.</p><p>CR1 is a receptor for the malaria parasite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It also has been implicated as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Levels of CR1 are reduced in diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), glomerulonephritides, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These diseases feature immune complexes that may reduce levels of CR1, and in the case of SLE, such reductions parallel disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Complement receptor 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complement receptor 2 (also called CR2, C3d or C3dg receptor, and CD21) is expressed on B lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, epithelial cells in the pharynx and upper airway, and in low amounts on peripheral blood T cells. It is not found on monocytes, granulocytes, or erythrocytes.</p><p>CR2 serves to localize complement-bearing immune complexes to B lymphocyte-rich areas of the spleen and lymph nodes. In this way, CR2, as well as CR1, promotes antigen-driven activation of B cells. This &quot;adjuvant&quot; function of the complement system is being exploited by attaching C3 fragments to vaccines in order to enhance their antigenicity. CR2, through its association with other membrane proteins, is also an important coreceptor in the signaling of B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/1,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,34</a>]. CR2 is the receptor for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-adhesion-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since immune complexes possess variable quantities of C3-derived fragments (C3b, iC3b, C3dg, and C3d), multiple complement receptors usually cooperate to help clear immune complexes and facilitate adaptive immune responses to antigens.

Functions of CRIg include inhibition of the alternative pathway, clearance of systemic pathogens, and regulation of the adaptive immune response. CRIg is widely expressed in lung, adipose tissue, spleen, adrenal gland, small intestine, bladder, colon, breast, and on macrophages associated with blood vessels.

Liberation of C3a and C5a and interaction with their respective receptors triggers the acute inflammatory reaction. C5a is a major chemotactic factor for neutrophils.

C5aR1 is better defined, while C5aR2 is less well-understood and may be a decoy receptor for C5a [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. C5aR1 is prominently expressed on neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, and basophils.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Complement regulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receptors for complement activation fragments are expressed on many host cells, including peripheral blood cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. Receptors for C4b and C3b are present on most cells of the immune system and promote pathogen destruction and generation of the adaptive immune response. Receptors for C3a and C5a are widely distributed where they trigger the local inflammatory response (innate immunity) and also cell activation to prepare for the adaptive immune response. Together, these receptors promote the adherence and ingestion of micro-organisms and immune complexes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58974 \">table 2</a>).
