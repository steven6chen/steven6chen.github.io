The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes, and nearly always experience major depressive and hypomanic episodes. Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic episodes. Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of bipolar disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4503550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385746629\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a>&rsquo;s mechanism of action in treating mania is unknown. One hypothesis is that it depletes inositol in the central nervous system and dampens neurotransmission dependent upon this second messenger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Other hypotheses are that lithium works by inhibiting the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3&beta; in regulating an intracellular signaling peptide called Wnt, or by inhibiting overactive protein kinase C intracellular signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Lithium appears to affect multiple neurotransmitter systems including norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and gamma aminobutyric acid; and second messenger systems including cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/6,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9</a>]. </p><p>In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> also appears to increase neurogenesis and neuroprotective factors, and in patients with bipolar disorder, may preserve or increase cortical gray matter, white matter integrity, and hippocampal volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study found that hippocampal volumes were smaller in bipolar patients who were never exposed to lithium (n = 15), compared with healthy controls (n = 15) and patients who were exposed for more than two years (n = 15); hippocampal volumes were comparable for the controls and the patients exposed to lithium for more than two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].The neuroprotective effects of lithium may be the result of direct neurochemical effects, rather than indirect effects secondary to treatment or prevention of mood episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446684325\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE IN TREATING BIPOLAR DISORDER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two primary considerations in choosing a medication are clinical efficacy and tolerability.

Another consideration is cost. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> is one of many medications that can be selected to treat acute mania, hypomania, and bipolar and unipolar depression, and is also a potential choice for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.

Lithium is rapidly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract; food does not alter lithium absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Peak serum levels occur in one to two hours with standard, immediate release preparations of lithium and within four to five hours with slow release preparations. Absorption of immediate release lithium is complete within six to eight hours, and for slow release preparations in approximately 8 to 12 hours. Lithium is not protein bound and is distributed throughout total body water. Brain levels are highest within two hours of peak serum levels. Steady state is achieved within four to five days after the last dose change.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> is not metabolized and is excreted almost exclusively through the kidneys. Thus, lithium&rsquo;s elimination half-life is determined primarily by renal function. The half-life in healthy young patients is about 24 hours, and increases as renal function declines with age. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182696749\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESCRIBING LITHIUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several basic points to discuss with patients before prescribing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, including potential side effects, the need to take the medication as prescribed rather than on as-needed basis, and to expect that response and remission may not occur until a few days to weeks have elapsed after a therapeutic <span class=\"nowrap\">dose/level</span> has been achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182696765\"><span class=\"h2\">Lithium dose and serum concentrations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> is usually 300 mg two or three times daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/6,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29-31</a>]. The total daily dose is then increased by 300 to 600 mg every one to five days based upon response, tolerability, and body mass index. The goal is to reach a therapeutic serum level, which generally occurs with a dose of 900 mg to 1800 mg per day. Dose increases generally occur more frequently at the beginning of treatment, and less often as clinicians approach the target dose.</p><p>The half-life of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> is approximately 24 hours. Thus, it takes at least four or five days for serum lithium concentrations to reach steady state after the dose is changed. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> can be dosed either once daily or in a divided dose regimen. Clinicians should start with a twice daily or three times daily dosing schedule to minimize side effects (especially nausea) early in treatment and consolidate the dose schedule to once daily after a number of weeks or months of treatment. Some patients may have to continue taking lithium in two or four divided doses to minimize peak level side effects. However, adherence generally decreases as the frequency of dosing increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>The target serum level for acute phase management and maintenance treatment is between 0.8 and 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.8 and 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and levels should usually not exceed 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Patients who cannot tolerate a level of 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> may respond to a level of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>After reaching the estimated therapeutic dose range (generally 900 mg to 1800 mg per day), the serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> concentration should be checked. Subsequently, a level should be measured five to seven days after each dose increase. In addition, if the dose is not changed and a level not checked for two or more weeks, a level should be checked before increasing the dose. An office-based instrument for fingerstick tests of lithium levels is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> levels should be drawn approximately 12 hours after the last dose (12-hour serum trough level) and generally collected in the morning, before the first dose of the day. Changes in the serum level per unit time are not dramatic 12 hours after the last dose. Thus, a level drawn 11 to 13 hours after the last dose, or even 10 to 14 hours, provides meaningful information. In contrast, a serum level drawn a few hours after lithium ingestion is subject to marked fluctuation if the level is drawn one hour sooner or later, leading to unreliable information. </p><p>Serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> levels are closely related to renal function, salt balance, and water balance. Clinicians can expect lithium concentrations to change as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dehydration (may occur with gastrointestinal viral infections or high fever) causes higher <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> levels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing sodium intake causes increased sodium and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> excretion and lower lithium levels </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased sodium intake causes sodium and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> reabsorption in the proximal tubule and an increase in serum lithium levels.</p><p/><p>When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> is taken once per day, serum concentrations are approximately 25 percent higher compared with levels that are observed when lithium is taken two or three times per day; this is due to changes in renal excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-and-lithium-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Therefore, a once daily lithium level of 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> is expected to drop to a level of 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> if the patient switches to a divided dose regimen.

(See <a href=\"#H182696765\" class=\"local\">'Lithium dose and serum concentrations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The target serum level for acute phase management and maintenance treatment is between 0.8 and 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.8 and 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and levels should not exceed 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Patients who cannot tolerate a level of 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> may respond to a level of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H182696765\" class=\"local\">'Lithium dose and serum concentrations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levels should generally be measured five to seven days after each dose increase. In addition, a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> level should be checked if a dose increase is under consideration and a level has not been measured within the past two weeks. Patients on steady doses should have their levels checked every 6 to 12 months. Lithium levels should be drawn 12 hours after the last dose (12-hour serum trough level) and generally collected in the morning, before the first dose of the day. (See <a href=\"#H182696765\" class=\"local\">'Lithium dose and serum concentrations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H182696800\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> levels are closely related to renal function, salt balance, and water balance. Dehydration causes higher lithium levels, increasing sodium intake causes lower lithium levels, and decreased sodium intake causes an increase in serum lithium levels. (See <a href=\"#H182696765\" class=\"local\">'Lithium dose and serum concentrations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> is contraindicated in patients with significant renal impairment, sodium depletion, dehydration, significant cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H182696779\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> levels can lead to toxicity with severe side effects and multisystem dysfunction which can be fatal if not recognized. Lithium toxicity is a clinical diagnosis that is confirmed by serum lithium levels. Relatively mild toxicity usually does not occur until serum lithium reaches a level of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Levels &ge; 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> constitute a medical emergency, even in patients who appear relatively asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H182696786\" class=\"local\">'Lithium toxicity'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lithium poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many medications can alter <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> concentrations. Lithium levels are increased by thiazide diuretics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) except <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, tetracyclines, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>. Lithium levels are decreased by potassium-sparing diuretics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>. Lithium levels are increased or decreased by loop diuretics and calcium channel blockers. (See <a href=\"#H182696793\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions with lithium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to beginning <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, clinicians should obtain a urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, thyroid function studies, calcium, pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) for patients over age 40. BUN and creatinine should be checked every two to three months during the first six months of therapy, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Thyroid function should be checked once or twice during the first six months, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. (See <a href=\"#H182696800\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common acute side effects associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> are nausea, tremor, polyuria and thirst, weight gain, loose stools, and cognitive impairment. Severe or a sudden worsening of side effects may be a sign of lithium toxicity. Important long term adverse effects of lithium involve the kidneys and thyroid gland. In addition, cardiac rhythm disturbances have been described; these almost always occur in patients with preexisting cardiac disease.
