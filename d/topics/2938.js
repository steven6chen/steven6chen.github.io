However, these observations do not prove a causal relationship, since increasing blood pressure could be a marker for other risk factors such as increasing body weight, which is associated with dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and the metabolic syndrome.

In one large cohort study, for example, hypertension (which was defined as a blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;140/90</span> mmHg) increased the relative risk of stroke (by 3.8 and 2.6 in men and women, respectively) and heart failure (by 4.0 and 3.0, respectively) to a greater degree than the relative risk of coronary heart disease (by 2.0 and 2.2, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Projections have been made for the expected decrease in morbidity and mortality resulting from a 10 to 12 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure and a 5 to 6 mmHg reduction in diastolic pressure using data from multiple clinical trials performed over the past 30 years. Although not proving cause-and-effect, the estimated benefit from this degree of blood pressure lowering is a 38 percent reduction in risk of stroke and a 16 percent reduction in risk of coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As noted above, the best evidence for a causal role of increasing blood pressure in cardiovascular complications is an improvement in outcome with antihypertensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In addition to hypertension, the major risk factors are older age, elevated plasma cholesterol, a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking. Thus, individual patients who have significant hypertension but none or few of the other risk factors are at relatively lower overall risk than patients with less hypertension but more of the other risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55353\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55353 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>].</p><p>Multiple risk prediction models using these and other risk factors have been developed, most notably the Framingham risk score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The ability of the Framingham risk criteria to predict cardiovascular disease has been widely reproduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>], but the degree of cardiovascular risk related to the Framingham risk criteria may not apply to all patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Other risk factors have been proposed to improve upon the Framingham risk assessment, including C-reactive protein, brain natriuretic peptide, echocardiography, and other studies for detecting subclinical vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. However, none have been proven to add significantly to the Framingham scoring, and they are probably not cost effective.</p><p>Other risk prediction models exist, including one developed by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) that incorporated data from multiple patient cohorts and includes risk of all cardiovascular events, including stroke, rather than coronary heart disease alone (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cardiovascular-risk-assessment-in-adults-10-year-acc-aha-2013\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>A detailed discussion on estimation of cardiovascular risk in an individual without known disease is presented elsewhere.

The benefit a patient receives from blood pressure lowering depends upon the balance between the <strong>absolute</strong> (rather than relative) reduction in risk for adverse outcomes and the potential harms and burdens of antihypertensive therapy.</p><p>Although the relative cardiovascular risk reduction appears to be the same regardless of the baseline cardiovascular risk, the absolute number of cardiovascular events prevented by therapy is significantly greater in the population with higher baseline cardiovascular risk. This concept is presented in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-is-goal-blood-pressure-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension#H479320743\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What is goal blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension?&quot;, section on 'Benefit according to overall cardiovascular risk'</a>.)</p><p>A group from New Zealand, for example, took various cardiovascular risk factors into account in determining the overall risk status of individual patients, including their level of blood pressure, age, gender, and other factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55353\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55353 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. They then examined the evidence of benefits of antihypertensive therapy from the clinical trials and considered the costs of such therapy. They concluded that antihypertensive therapy could be justified only if the risk for a major cardiovascular event over the next five years was 10 percent or greater or if the level of blood pressure was so high as to mandate therapy regardless of overall risk status <span class=\"nowrap\">(&ge;170/100</span> mmHg).</p><p>Several professional organizations have recommended that markers of overall cardiovascular risk be incorporated in treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

This is an important issue because it is the <strong>prior</strong> risk status that is more likely to be responsible for the current health of the individual.</p><p>As an example, although blood pressure at the time of risk assessment (current blood pressure) is typically used in most prediction algorithms, this does not accurately reflect an individual's past blood pressure experience; the use of long-term, average blood pressure is more accurate. This is supported by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 3560 individuals, the presence of elevated blood pressure before age 35 years was associated with coronary calcification (which is a strong predictor of future coronary heart disease) later in life. This association was observed after adjusting for blood pressure and other coronary risk factors that were present after age 35 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from the Framingham Heart Study found that recent and remote antecedent blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure) predicted cardiovascular risk incrementally over current blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This effect was seen in men and women, younger and older subjects, and lower and higher blood pressure groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 1604 men whose risk status was first assessed when they were aged 45 to 64 years and free of clinically obvious cardiovascular disease were then reassessed 25 years later when they were aged 70 to 90 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Most patients changed their risk status over this time period, moving forward or backward. When the current risk status of the 342 subjects who developed cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stroke) during the follow-up period was compared with that of the 279 who remained healthy, there were few differences. However, the results were different when the original risk status was used. Those patients who remained healthy had significantly lower blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">(121/79</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">134/83</span> mmHg) and plasma cholesterol levels (211 versus 226 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.45 versus 5.84 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> 25 years before.</p><p/><p>Based upon these data, clinicians need to be cautious about only using current cardiovascular risk estimates to predict subsequent events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
