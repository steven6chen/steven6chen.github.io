According to the World Health Organization, worldwide obesity has doubled since 1980 with 1.5 billion adults considered obese in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, 34 percent of US adults aged 20 years and over are overweight, 34 percent are obese, and 6 percent are extremely obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Australia, 54 percent of the population is considered overweight, while 18 percent are obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In China nearly one-quarter of the country's total population of 1.3 billion is now overweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Obesity has long been associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). In a meta-analysis of studies assessing the impact of body weight on CHD, there was a 29 percent increase in CHD for each five-unit increase in body mass index (BMI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63600 \">table 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74762\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74762 \">table 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The risk of CHD in obese and overweight persons is compounded by the frequent coexistence of other CHD risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. How much of the risk is due to obesity alone has been uncertain. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which obesity (particularly abdominal obesity) cause or accelerate coronary atherogenesis are also uncertain.</p><p>Evidence does exist to suggest that obesity, particularly visceral adipose, among adolescents is associated with acceleration of atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. More recently, long-term follow-up from Denmark demonstrated BMI during childhood was positively associated with increased risk of CHD during adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The epidemiologic evidence supporting obesity as an independent risk factor, possible mechanisms of action, and the benefit of weight reduction will be reviewed here.

The NHANES 2007 to 2008 data suggest an increase in the prevalence of obesity from a previous level of 23 percent in 1988 to 1994.

This action should heighten clinician awareness about the importance of obesity and stimulate a more vigorous approach to prevention and treatment.

There is strong, consistent epidemiologic evidence for an association between obesity and CHD, but supporting data from clinical trials are lacking.

As an example, the Munster Heart Study (PROCAM) followed 16,288 men and 7325 women for up to seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There was a graded positive relationship between BMI and other CHD risk factors including age, total serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in addition to markers of inflammation and thrombosis. The increase of CHD death associated with BMI was completely accounted for and mediated by these risk factors.</p><p>By contrast, other studies have found that obesity is an independent cardiovascular risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Nurses' Health Study evaluated the relationship between BMI and total and cause specific mortality in 115,195 United States women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In multivariate analyses of women who had never smoked, there was a significant trend for increasing risk of death with increasing BMI; compared with women with a BMI &lt;19 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> the relative risk of death was: 1.2 for a BMI 19 to 24.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</span> 1.3 for a BMI 25 to 26.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</span> 1.6 for a BMI 27 to 28.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</span> 2.1 to 2.2 for a BMI &gt;29 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. The risk of death was increased at BMI levels well below those considered to indicate obesity, with a striking increase in risk for truly obese women. Weight gain of 10 kg or more after the age of 18 was associated with increased mortality in middle adulthood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There was also an association between BMI and cardiovascular mortality. Among women with a BMI of 32 or higher who had never smoked, the relative risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 4.1 compared with women who had a BMI below 19.0.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the basis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the prevalence of overweight in children between 6 and 11 years of age increased from 4.0 percent in 1971 to 1974 to 17.5 percent in 2001 to 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The prevalence of overweight in adolescents between 12 and 19 years of age increased from 6.1 to 17.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Furthermore, the Bogalusa Heart Study examined 9167 5- to 17-year olds in seven cross-sectional studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although adverse lipid, insulin, and blood pressure levels did not vary substantially with BMI index levels &lt;85<sup>th</sup> percentile, risk factor prevalence increased greatly at higher levels. Approximately 11 percent of examined school children were considered overweight, while 58 percent of the overweight children were found to have at least one cardiac risk factor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study followed 1,141,609 subjects over 9.2 years to assess whether BMI is associated with increased mortality risk among Asian men and women. The BMI criteria are essentially derived from studies of European populations, while the validity has yet to be determined in Asian populations. The investigators revealed a U-shaped association between BMI and the risk of death in East Asians, with CVD being the major cause of death for overweight populations, a pattern broadly similar to that seen in previous studies involving mostly North American and European populations. The finding that the same optimal weight range is associated with the lowest risk of death both in Asian and European populations argues strongly against the use of race- or ethnicity-specific BMI cutoffs for overweight and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors study evaluated 1016 subjects at age 70 to determine if obesity without metabolic disturbances has an increased risk of CVD. Subjects with obesity without metabolic syndrome showed impaired vasoreactivity, a more echolucent carotid artery wall, increased left ventricular mass and function together with impaired <span class=\"nowrap\">coagulation/fibrinolysis</span> compared with normal-weight subjects without metabolic syndrome. In contrast to previous studies, the data do not support that obesity without metabolic syndrome is a benign condition. This was also the case for overweight individual subjects without metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity was also found to be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in the Framingham Heart Study, which analyzed 30-year follow-up data on male participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Using Metropolitan Relative Weight criteria, the minimum mortality was seen in the group of men with desirable weight (100 to 109 percent &quot;normal&quot;). Multivariate analyses showed a strong positive relationship between baseline weight and death occurring at any interval; the 30 year mortality rate for nonsmoking men who were overweight (weight more than 110 percent desirable weight) was up to 3.9 times higher than men of desirable weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another prospective study of over one million adults followed for 14 years found that obesity was strongly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death among nonsmokers and those without a history of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. All-cause mortality was lowest in adults with a BMI between 23.5 and 24.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> in men and 22 and 23.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> in women; mortality rates progressively increased at higher indices and were highest in the heaviest men and women who had a BMI &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (relative risk 2.7 and 1.9, respectively). A high BMI was most predictive of death from cardiovascular disease, especially in men (relative risk 2.9); significantly increased risks of death from cardiovascular disease were found at all indices greater than 26.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> in men and 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> in women. The risk associated with BMI was greater for whites than blacks.</p><p/><p>Thus, in several large, prospective, long-term studies using multivariate analyses, obesity was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and death from CHD in both women and men. However, other studies have observed reduced mortality risk with increasing BMI among patients with a prior history of heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Data from over 9000 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization suggest obese patients tend to be younger, and more likely to have single-vessel disease. At one year, patients with normal BMI had higher rates of mortality compared with overweight and obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The demonstration that a physical characteristic, biochemical finding, or lifestyle habit is associated with an increased risk of CHD does not by itself establish a causal relationship. Since CHD is a multifactorial disease, a risk factor may be a primary causal agent (eg, LDL cholesterol), or a facilitating causal agent (eg, hypertension, diabetes, and cigarette smoking). Obesity should be viewed in the latter category. Thus, it probably interacts with other risk factors to varying degrees in each individual.</p><p>There are a number of physiological and metabolic changes associated with obesity that may contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin resistance: Definition and clinical spectrum&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipid abnormalities, including low HDL level, high triglyceride level, increased apolipoprotein B level (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipoprotein classification, metabolism, and role in atherosclerosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic and diastolic hypertension (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-risks-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular risks of hypertension&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular hypertrophy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical implications and treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endothelial dysfunction (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery endothelial dysfunction: Clinical aspects&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive sleep apnea (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Metabolic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visceral or abdominal obesity is associated with insulin resistance and an array of metabolic and hemodynamic disorders, including hyperinsulinemia, atherogenic blood lipid changes, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.
