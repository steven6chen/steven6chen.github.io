They result primarily from deficiencies of specific enzymes in the breakdown pathways of amino acids. Enzyme deficiencies in beta oxidation of fatty acids or carbohydrate metabolism cause elevated levels of non-amino organic acids. Abnormal organic acid levels also are found in the urine of some patients with mitochondrial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most organic acidemias become clinically apparent during the newborn period or early infancy. After an initial period of well-being, affected children develop a life-threatening episode of metabolic acidosis characterized by an increased anion gap. This presenting episode may be mistaken for sepsis and, if unrecognized, is associated with significant mortality.</p><p>Children with an organic acidemia are susceptible to metabolic decompensation during episodes of increased catabolism, such as intercurrent illness, trauma, surgery, or prolonged episodes of fasting. Parents and clinicians must be well informed about the initial signs of decompensation and trained in applying an emergency regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware of potential complications and their prevention during anesthesia and surgery.</p><p>Diagnosis has been facilitated through the use of gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Prenatal diagnosis is available for most disorders by detection of diagnostic compounds in amniotic fluid, by analysis of enzyme activities in amniocytes or chorionic villi, by molecular analysis, or by a combination of the three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Diagnosis also may be made through newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry, which is available in all states of the United States, Australia, and many European and Asian countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organic acidemias can be classified as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/1,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Branched-chain organic acidemias, discussed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53127\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53127 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65861\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef65861 \">algorithm 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple carboxylase deficiency, including holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency and biotinidase deficiency (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the hereditary ataxias&quot;, section on 'Disorders of pyruvate and lactate metabolism'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glutaric acidemia (or aciduria) type 1 (GA1) and related organic acidemias, discussed below</p><p/><p>Abnormal organic acid levels may also be observed in patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatty acid oxidation defects (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metabolic-myopathies-caused-by-disorders-of-lipid-and-purine-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metabolic myopathies caused by disorders of lipid and purine metabolism&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders of energy metabolism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inherited-disorders-of-glucose-and-glycogen-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inherited disorders of glucose and glycogen metabolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>The more prevalent organic acidemias are reviewed here: methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), isovaleric acidemia (IVA), 3-methylcrotonylglycinuria (3-MCG), 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA), and GA1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before addressing the individual disorders, considering the common features of clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management is useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns with organic acidemia typically present during the first one to two weeks after birth with poor feeding, vomiting, floppiness, muscular hypotonia, and increasing lethargy that progresses to coma. In contrast to the other organic acidurias, glutaric acidemia type 1 (GA1) rarely presents in the newborn period (see <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Glutaric acidemia type 1'</a> below). Pregnancy and perinatal history frequently are uncomplicated.

Infants typically have severe metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap, ketosis, and hyperammonemia. Other common findings include hypoglycemia and electrolyte and other abnormalities associated with volume depletion. A complete blood count and differential are performed to detect neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or pancytopenia, which occur frequently because of bone marrow suppression.

Other associated illnesses, such as infections, also are treated. A central line for intravenous therapy and management on a level II to III intensive care unit experienced with acute therapy of episodes of metabolic decompensation is recommended.</p><p>These children usually require intravenous therapy during an acute decompensation because nausea and vomiting make oral intake unlikely. Protein is withheld for 24 to a maximum of 48 hours during the acute illness and reintroduced as a low-protein diet, as discussed below. Intravenous hydration is started at 1.25 to 1.5 times maintenance fluid requirements with a solution that provides glucose at an infusion rate based upon the estimated normal hepatic glucose production rate for age. We typically start with the following glucose infusion rates, depending upon age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and increase as tolerated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full term newborns and infants up to one year of age &ndash; 6 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children 1 to 6 years &ndash; 6 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children 6 to 12 years &ndash; 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents (older than 12 years) &ndash; 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per minute</p><p/><p>The maximum blood glucose concentration should not exceed 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Insulin supplementation may be needed in some instances to avoid hyperglycemia and to promote protein synthesis. Overall energy intake should be maximized and typically requires the addition of intralipid to parenteral therapy, provided that disorders of fatty acid oxidation have been ruled out.</p><p>Acidosis is corrected with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium bicarbonate</a>. Patients with persistent, severe acidosis (because hypernatremia or volume overload limits the amount of bicarbonate that can be given) or hyperammonemia may need hemodialysis or hemofiltration. Peritoneal dialysis is obsolete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

This diet should be supplemented with an amino acid mixture that excludes the offending amino acids. If the infant remains dependent upon parenteral nutrition, an amino acid mixture providing a minimum of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day of protein is given to avoid catabolism. Sufficient energy should be provided with carbohydrate and fat, and the amount of protein should be increased, if tolerated. Long fasts are avoided.

Plasma carnitine levels are usually low in patients with organic acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. L-carnitine (200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day given intravenously or 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day divided into three doses given orally during acute decompensation) is given to enhance the formation and excretion of acylcarnitine conjugates thought to be toxic to the brain, liver, and kidneys. L-carnitine even at higher doses is generally well tolerated. Multivitamins and calcium supplements also are provided to avoid deficiencies that may result from the low-protein diet.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carglumic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Carglumic acid</a> is an option in cases of methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA) when significant hyperammonemia (eg, &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Accumulation of propionyl-CoA in these disorders leads to reduced synthesis of N-acetyl-glutamate, the physiologic activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1. Carglumic acid, a molecular analogue, may reduce hyperammonemia through direct activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Additional medications are given for the specific disorders as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be seen at least twice and up to six times per year by a multidisciplinary team led by a biochemical geneticist familiar with the management of organic acidemias. Infants or those with poor metabolic control are evaluated more frequently. A dietitian experienced in dietary therapy of inborn errors of metabolism should manage the specific low-protein diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">METHYLMALONIC ACIDEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA, also called methylmalonic aciduria) encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders that is characterized by impaired metabolism of methylmalonic acid that is generated during the metabolism of certain amino acids (isoleucine, methionine, threonine, or valine) and odd-chain fatty acids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53127\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53127 \">algorithm 1</a>). These disorders are caused by a deficiency of the adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mut), a dimer of identical subunits encoded on chromosome 6p12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], or its cofactor, cobalamin (cbl, vitamin B12), which is required for the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl CoA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F102473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102473 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Mutations in at least nine different genes can cause the MMA phenotype and are classified into the following complementation groups: mut(0), mut(-), cblA, cblB, cblC, cblD, cblF, cblH, and cblJ. Patients with the mut(0) defect have undetectable mutase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], whereas those in the mut(-) group have residual, but abnormal activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The other forms interfere with formation of the cofactor cobalamin through defects in the pathway of adenosylcobalamin synthesis (cblA, cblB, and cblH), in the common pathway of cobalamin reduction (cblC and cblD), or in lysosomal cobalamin transport (cblF, cblJ). The mut(0), mut(-), cbIA, and cbIB defects occur in approximately 30, 10, 30, and 20 percent, respectively, of patients with MMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/17,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20-22</a>]. CblC, cblF, and cblJ defects lead to combined MMA and homocystinuria in all cases, whereas cblD defects may result in MMA, homocystinuria, or combined MMA and homocystinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. CbIC is the most common among these complementation groups, with more than 100 cases reported throughout the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24</a>]. The molecular basis of all complementation groups has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/18,19,21,22,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,21,22,24-26</a>].</p><p>Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) is caused by deficiency of methylmalonyl CoA and malonyl CoA synthetase (ACSF3). Patients with CMAMMA show elevated MMA and malonic acid in urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>MMA also can result from cobalamin deficiency. Causes include dietary deficiency, as may occur in vegetarians; impaired intestinal absorption caused by deficiency of intrinsic factor or cubilin, the intestinal receptor that binds the intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex (Imerslund-Gr&auml;sbeck syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]; or deficiency of transcobalamin II, which is required for cobalamin entry into cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vegetarian-diets-for-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vegetarian diets for children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of MMA is 1:48,000, according to screenings of three- to four-week-old infants in Massachusetts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. All genetic forms of MMA are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Thus, MMA occurs more frequently in populations with increased rates of consanguinity. MMA can be detected transiently in some otherwise healthy infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns with MMA mut(0) or MMA mut(-) typically present with the signs of an organic acidemia. The initial presentation in older infants or children with one of the other forms of MMA may include lethargy, seizures, muscular hypotonia, and hypoglycemia during an episode of metabolic decompensation that often is associated with an intercurrent illness. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p>Most patients with cblC defects present as newborns, with signs similar to those of MMA mut(0) or MMA mut(-). Microcephaly, pigmentary retinopathy, nystagmus, secondary reduced visual acuity, hydrocephalus, or megaloblastic anemia may develop in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/17,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,31</a>]. In one report, microcephaly and hydrocephalus were present at birth in 43 and 18 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Rarely, affected patients present during childhood or adolescence with the clinical picture of motor neuron disease, lower leg hyposensitivity, and thrombosis. The neurologic symptoms may not be reversible, despite treatment, and can lead to continued gait disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Children with cblC are at risk for developing thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), although the frequency of cblC-associated TMA is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. One adult case with cblC-associated TMA was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Other presenting signs include dehydration and failure to thrive, developmental delay, skin lesions (eg, moniliasis), and occasional hepatomegaly. Some infants with MMA mut(0), MMA mut(-), or cblC have facial dysmorphism (high forehead; broad nasal bridge; epicanthal folds; long, smooth philtrum; and triangular mouth). This facial dysmorphism also may be observed in patients with propionic acidemia (PA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Propionic acidemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Asymptomatic benign MMA associated with increased excretion of methylmalonate but with no apparent clinical symptoms has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of MMA is made by measurement of organic acids in the urine using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Large amounts of methylmalonic acid, as well as methylcitrate, PA, and 3-OH propionic acid, are present. Plasma MMA concentration is also markedly elevated. Plasma acylcarnitine analysis shows elevated concentration of <span class=\"nowrap\">methylmalonyl/propionyl</span> carnitine (C3). Measurement of plasma amino acids typically shows elevation of glycine; however, plasma glycine can be normal, even in an infant who previously had abnormal glycine levels. Glycine is not suitable as a metabolic marker, since it does not follow metabolic control. In patients with combined MMA and homocystinuria (cblC, cblD, cblF), plasma homocysteine levels are elevated, and methionine is often low. The plasma cobalamin concentration typically is normal, and megaloblastic anemia is not seen with the exception of cblC. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of MMA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micronutrient-deficiencies-associated-with-malnutrition-in-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Micronutrient deficiencies associated with malnutrition in children&quot;, section on 'Vitamin B12'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific treatment for MMA consists of a low-protein diet from food sources, such as milk products or meat, that contain the minimum natural protein required for growth (0.5 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day). The diet can be supplemented with an amino acid mixture that <strong>does not contain</strong> isoleucine, methionine, threonine, or valine, all of which are metabolized via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53127\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53127 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, excessive consumption of this &quot;medical food&quot; in patients with MMA, while uncommon, can result in increased leucine intake that causes depletion of the essential amino acids valine and isoleucine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These amino acid deficiencies are associated with poor growth outcomes. Reduction in intake of the medical food alone, without increasing dietary protein intake, resolves the amino acid deficiencies. Plasma amino acid analysis is performed on a regular basis (monthly to quarterly), depending upon age and individual circumstance, to monitor for increased or decreased levels.</p><p>Patients with cobalamin C (cblC) defects, which cause combined MMA and homocystinuria, should be treated carefully with the medical food used for MMA since this medical food is devoid of methionine and is relatively high in leucine content. Use of this medical food in patients with cblC deficiency could potentially adversely affect brain growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Plasma methionine levels should be carefully monitored as part of the regular plasma amino acid analysis. The additional therapies used in patients with cblC maintain normal methionine levels. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> below.)</p><p>Dietary protein is increased gradually over time, taking into account age, weight, metabolic control, and plasma levels of essential amino acids. However, no plasma amino acid concentration exists that can be used as a metabolic marker in MMA, as is the case, for example, in maple syrup urine disease. Serial measurements of plasma MMA concentrations may be helpful to guide management.</p><p>The intake of odd-chain fatty acids (also metabolized by the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway) and polyunsaturated fat is restricted. Intralipid contains even-chain fatty acids and, therefore, can be given to supply additional calories in infants dependent upon parenteral nutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxocobalamin-vitamin-b12a-supplement-and-cyanide-antidote-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Hydroxocobalamin</a> (1 mg per day given intramuscularly) is given until the type of MMA is known.

Affected children typically have an episode of metabolic decompensation with ketoacidosis, hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, and encephalopathy during the first year or later, often accompanied by infection and fever. They also develop an irreversible dystonic movement disorder with preserved cognitive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organic-acidemias/abstract/1,96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,96-98</a>].
