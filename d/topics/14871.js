However, many children complete schooling without achieving more than basic literacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pediatric clinicians are well positioned to identify children at risk for reading difficulties and children who have unexpected difficulties in learning to read. Early identification and timely intervention for such children improve long-term outcome. Clinicians who use standardized, validated screens will identify at-risk children more accurately than those who rely solely on clinical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical features and evaluation of reading difficulty in children will be reviewed here.

At this stage of education, the focus is on reading to learn rather than learning to read.

Having the child's parent(s) sign a form that authorizes the school to release information to the clinician and the clinician to release information to the school facilitates transmission of information. Many schools regularly test children with standardized achievement tests (eg, the California Achievement Tests, the Metropolitan Achievement Tests). Standardized achievement tests provide a profile of academic achievement within various subject areas. Younger children are tested on prereading skills, whereas high school students are tested on study skills and use of reference materials. These tests are designed to identify children who need further evaluation; they are not diagnostic instruments for learning disability or reading disability.</p><p>Children for whom a diagnosis of reading disability is being considered should undergo comprehensive educational evaluation. Educational testing may include reading assessment or more comprehensive testing that includes measures of intelligence and academic achievement.

This evaluation provides information about the child's reading skills, executive function skills, verbal intelligence quotient (IQ), etc. In the United States, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires public schools to provide free assessment and intervention. Schools that use a &quot;responsiveness to intervention&quot; model generally provide intervention before comprehensive testing. Schools that use a discrepancy model generally test before providing services. These issues are discussed separately.

These children receive empirically supported treatment in reading; their progress is monitored regularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These changes most often consist of reading specialists who provide reading support to students in kindergarten through fifth grade who need supplementary help with reading in addition to their regular classroom reading instruction. The reading specialists work with small groups of children, early literacy groups, and individual students, and go into classrooms to help with reading-related activities. Children who receive these services are not yet on an individualized education plan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-educational-management#H14923470\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Educational management&quot;, section on 'Responsiveness to intervention services'</a>.)</p><p>Children who respond to this intervention continue to be monitored. Those who fail to respond receive more intensive levels of service <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> undergo evaluation for the presence of a learning disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation/abstract/26,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,62,63</a>].

Tests measuring word accuracy alone may be inadequate to diagnose reading disability in the high-achieving young adult (eg, at the college, graduate, or professional-school level). Timed measures of reading (eg, the Nelson-Denny Reading Test) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57171\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57171 \">table 2</a>) are necessary to make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Fluency'</a> above.)</p><p>Another important pitfall in the diagnosis of reading disability is the failure to consider and address coexisting conditions, particularly those that may affect treatment (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, school avoidance).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following resources may provide additional information for parents and clinicians:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Overcoming Dyslexia&quot; by Sally Shaywitz, MD (2003)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.ldonline.org/&amp;token=o+L1UF59Ec+AaQ6MPjIfsFc+W0AkZvnbl4M7/LncsYivALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=600\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">LD OnLine</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/reading/resources/Pages/default.aspx&amp;token=pVeRf5+oEynHtrFeTKjfbXBEoDPw1SgJ8peYeY8Uc9u4KxE/K5cbNPfmIRV9jiU4LvyhLrgx9IbSEkV3wkVwwrze3axin62czgE0yzDq1BA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=600\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://interdys.org/&amp;token=xc4RPZ07HAjFTPYwryN1FeqE7jkZen1LMdJ5AobbC+E=&amp;TOPIC_ID=600\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">International Dyslexia Association</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.greatschools.org/special-education.topic?content=1541&amp;token=Q4UWNpuy/9i7ZUcqLrI+u5bAMWNEBP0+k9E817pOVDhaReuHXt5xzlTbfc46vj2LcsG9IOsR945Kv2mHw8AjgzMChR7QyQA1+uy90geqb2E=&amp;TOPIC_ID=600\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Great Schools</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.readingrockets.org/&amp;token=3x63S/IxVVkMbGZHTrFn2hddUyH8XD4i7QIn/+XV00Ja1lk9448nKwqScA3pD7Aj&amp;TOPIC_ID=600\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Reading Rockets</a> for kindergarten through third grade students</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://fcsn.org/&amp;token=6EOgBpd2a7/D8YJv8cj5KQQeyz164yrsnh6DtaxQZtQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=600\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The Federation for Children with Special Needs</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.learningally.org/&amp;token=oX9/VeMIyeE8wCpzGaEk2Y75ETCig+Q3W10JTptNB5nh4tcmCVWx4NSOP0fo5i8g&amp;TOPIC_ID=600\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Learning Ally</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <a href=\"http://www.fcrr.org/&amp;token=PDGR/iSKWabfyrOzaPEGODO4+wWySw3Zi56iFOGNd/c=&amp;TOPIC_ID=600\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Florida Center for Reading Research</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://balancedreading.com/&amp;token=RIhvs/9iMY7AknT4PNp4xXFmrNiWa+aR3fzJXHj3kZQkO9bA9vYnStq8PVLBUW3b&amp;TOPIC_ID=600\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Balanced Reading</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
