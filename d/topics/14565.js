This infection, caused by <em>Chlamydia psittaci</em>, is transmitted to humans predominantly from birds.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of psittacosis will be discussed here. Pneumonia caused by <em>Chlamydia</em> spp is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia caused by Chlamydia species in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2751178055\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. psittaci</em> is an obligate intracellular bacterium. There are 10 known genotypes based on sequencing of the major outer protein gene, <em>ompA </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Each genotype has host preferences and virulence characteristics, although these overlap. Knowledge of the pathogenesis at a cellular and molecular level is growing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psittacosis has been recognized throughout the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. In a meta-analysis of observational studies, <em>C. psittaci</em>, the causative agent of psittacosis, was estimated to cause approximately 1 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the precise incidence and prevalence of psittacosis is difficult to establish, likely due to lack of routine testing and varying sensitivity and specificity of commonly used diagnostic tests. As the use of molecular diagnostic assays increases, knowledge of the epidemiology of psittacosis is expected to grow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Birds are the primary reservoir, but transmission from other animals has also been reported. The disease usually occurs sporadically, but outbreaks caused by contact with an infected bird are not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Outbreaks related to pet shops, aviaries, veterinary facilities, poultry flocks, and turkey and duck processing have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Birds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with psittacosis have a history of contact with birds. <em>C. psittaci</em> has been documented in at least 460 species from 30 bird orders, including turkeys, pheasants, chickens, and even ostriches and penguins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Migratory birds, including geese, may carry this pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Most humans are infected from birds of the order psittaciformes, which includes parakeets (budgerigars), cockatiels, cockatoos, and parrots. In France, mule ducks are associated with human disease through heavy shedding, although the ducks are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Each bird order tends to be infected by a predominant genotype of <em>C. psittaci</em>.</p><p>Of 1136 patients reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1975 and 1984, 72 percent had a history of contact with birds as pets or in a domestic setting, 6 percent had contact with wild birds, 12 percent were poultry workers, and only 10 percent had no recognized avian contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pigeons may be an especially significant source in springtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Veterinarians, veterinary technicians, zoo workers, pet shop owners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], duck farmers, poultry workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], and farmers can be infected. Fatalities have occurred in occupationally exposed workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In China, 12 percent of adult pet birds were seropositive in a 2014 survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Investigation of an outbreak in Sydney, Australia, revealed that, in some regions, psittacosis was endemic through bird exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The incubation period in birds is extremely variable, from three days for acute disease to years for reactivation of latent infection, often at a time of stress. Infection in birds is usually asymptomatic or may cause lethargy, anorexia, ruffled feathers, ocular or nasal discharge, or diarrhea. Some birds die rapidly; others become wasted or dehydrated. The organism is shed in feces, urine, and respiratory secretions. Once feces dry, the organism may become airborne as droplet nuclei. Dried organisms remain viable for months at room temperature.</p><p>Transmission from infected birds may not always require direct contact. In an investigation of 16 infected patients during an outbreak in a rural Australian town, cases spent more time gardening and were more likely to have mowed the lawn in the three weeks preceding illness than controls, but the feeding and keeping of domestic or wild birds was not associated with infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other species</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of infection from other animals to humans is rare. Certain strains of <em>C. psittaci</em> may infect sheep, goats, cats, dogs, dairy cattle, and horses, causing placental insufficiency, abortion, and a chronic respiratory infection. Exposures to the birth fluids and placentas of infected animals can lead to infection in humans. For example, an Australian outbreak affecting five staff in a veterinary school was traced to horse exposure through equine fetal membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Severe human disease in pregnancy contracted from lambing sheep is also well recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. To avoid this risk, pregnant women should avoid contact with birthing sheep, goats, and other farm animals and their gestational products. Feline keratoconjunctivitis agent (a strain of <em>C. psittaci</em>), which produces rhinitis and conjunctivitis in cats, is rarely transmitted to humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Children have acquired psittacosis from infected dogs; clinical manifestations in dogs include recurrent conjunctivitis, small litter size, and respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Human disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are usually infected by inhalation of organisms in dried feces when caged birds exercise their wings or in bird feather dust. Cage cleaning may pose an infection risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bird bites, mouth-to-beak contact, and even transient exposure, such as visiting a bird park, have also been implicated in the transmission of this infection. Virtually all pet birds can carry <em>C. psittaci</em>, but psittacine birds are the most likely to be infected. Less frequently, pigeons, doves, and mynahs carry infection. In an Italian series of 76 cases, most human infections were contracted from poultry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Human-to-human transmission may occur. In Sweden, one severely ill patient with psittacosis transmitted infection to 10 others, including a hospital roommate and 7 hospital staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Psittacosis is most common in young and middle-aged adults, although it has been described in all age groups. In several series, but not all, a marked predilection for males is noted, presumably related to increased potential for exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Person-to-person transmission is considered to be rare, although there is one report of seven cases of pneumonia among hospital workers exposed to a pet shop employee hospitalized with documented psittacosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Infection is not always associated with a major illness. When avian chlamydiosis was detected in a large shipment of pet birds, households exposed were investigated. Eleven percent of exposed persons developed an acute respiratory illness. Clinical or serological evidence of infection was found in 30 percent of households. In many, infection led to mild illness or was asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In 2014, a total of 8 psittacosis cases were reported in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], compared with an average of 10 cases (range 2 to 21) reported annually during the period 2005 to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. psittaci </em>infection of humans most commonly presents in young or middle-aged adults as fever of abrupt onset, pronounced headache, and dry cough. Infection can also be asymptomatic. Patients usually have a recent history of bird exposure. The incubation period is usually between 5 and 14 days but can be as long as 39 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In one study of 135 patients, systemic manifestations were prominent with fever in all patients, rigors occurring in 61 percent, and sweats and myalgias in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Though cough was present in 82 percent of patients, it frequently developed late. Other respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea, chest pain, and hemoptysis, were present in 24 percent of patients. Eighteen percent of patients had no respiratory symptoms.</p><p>Headache is common, usually severe, and may be accompanied by photophobia. One-third of the 135 patients in the above series underwent lumbar puncture for possible meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Other less common but important symptoms include pharyngitis, diarrhea, and altered mental status. Diarrhea may be seen in up to 25 percent of patients and is typically mild. It can be quite severe, however, and may even be the most prominent symptom in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Twelve percent of patients present with altered mental status, which can range from mild confusion to, rarely, overt encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients have some abnormalities on chest examination (usually rales), occasionally have evidence of consolidation, and uncommonly have a pleural rub. Pleural effusions occur infrequently and are rare enough to prompt reconsideration of the diagnosis. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly occur in approximately 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Organ system complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications in a number of organ systems may arise in patients with psittacosis. These are uncommon manifestations of the illness, but some can be severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, respiratory failure occurs requiring ventilatory support and can be fatal. In a report from the Netherlands, 8 of 12 patients with severe respiratory failure died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Patients with fulminant pneumonia often also manifest neurologic, renal, and gastrointestinal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Hematologic complications in fulminant disease include disseminated intravascular coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>] and hemophagocytic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild renal involvement with proteinuria and occasional oliguria is well recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Rarely, acute tubular necrosis may occur in fulminant psittacosis with respiratory failure. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and acute proliferative glomerulonephritis have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematologic complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold agglutinins are sometimes noted in psittacosis, but hemolytic anemia with jaundice is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Acute thrombocytopenic purpura, severe pancytopenia secondary to hemophagocytic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in a patient with respiratory failure have also been described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Icteric hepatitis occurs uncommonly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. One patient with multiple nodules in the liver and spleen who had a pericardial rub but no evidence of pulmonary disease was found to have hepatic granulomas and serological evidence of psittacosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurologic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide range of neurologic syndromes are infrequently seen, although abnormal neurologic findings are less common than with mycoplasma infection. Encephalitis was seen in 2 of 156 patients in a series from the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Cerebellar disturbance may be prominent. Psychiatric symptoms and intracranial hypertension have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. True meningitis with a cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis may occur rarely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. One patient presenting with status epilepticus suffered a protracted and severe neurologic illness. Direct invasion of the central nervous system was demonstrated by <em>Chlamydia</em> DNA in cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Uveitis has been seen in association with meningitis. Palsies of the 4<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> cranial nerve have been described, often accompanying overt encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Diplopia may persist for months. Transient sensorineural deafness associated with pneumonia has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Transverse myelitis with fever can also be the clinical presentation of psittacosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The neurologic deficit may or may not resolve. In addition, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome can follow acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Musculoskeletal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactive arthritis, though rare, has been reported. The onset may be a week or more after the first symptoms of psittacosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Migratory small and large joint arthritis, symmetrical polyarthritis, and reactive arthritis (formerly Reiter syndrome) have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Human leukocyte antigen&ndash;type associations have been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Rhabdomyolysis has also occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/30,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermatologic manifestations are infrequent. Erythema nodosum is the most frequent, but erythema multiforme, erythema marginatum, &quot;Horder spots,&quot; and panniculitis also have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H773294297\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic follicular conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conjunctivitis with enlarged preauricular nodes and punctuate epithelioid keratitis, without any associated systemic symptoms, has been reported in bird fanciers and laboratory workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Endocarditis, myocarditis, and pericarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocarditis caused by <em>C. psittaci </em>is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of culture-negative endocarditis usually lasting weeks or months, especially if there is a history of bird exposure. Serologic evidence of infection should then be sought. Surgery is often required, and a mortality of 50 percent has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. If the patient comes to surgery, electron microscopy and immunofluorescent staining of valvular tissue is suggested. Although there is anecdotal evidence to suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> treatment without surgery may at times be adequate, the optimal duration of treatment is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Myocarditis and pericarditis are also rare. Myocarditis may lead to left ventricular dilatation, but limited reports suggest resolution of myocardial damage with therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection in pregnancy may be life-threatening, particularly in the late second or third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Respiratory failure, liver dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation may threaten the life of the mother. Eleven of 14 pregnant women died in a psittacosis outbreak in 1938. Fetal outcome is poor, with fetal death in 11 of 14 reported cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>The infection may cross the placenta and cause intrauterine fetal compromise. The organism has a predilection for the placenta. Placental histopathologic findings consist of an intense acute intervillositis, perivillous fibrin deposition with villous necrosis, and large irregular basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions within the syncytiotrophoblast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. These changes can impair fetoplacental blood flow and increase the risk of bacterial embolization to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Although rare, infections with ovine <em>C. psittaci </em>are a particular hazard for pregnant women, in whom there is severe placentitis and frequently fetal loss. Such infections are mainly associated with contact with lambing sheep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Association with ocular adnexal lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting reports regarding a possible causal association between psittacosis and ocular adnexal lymphoma (OAL) as well as the response of OAL to treatment with antibiotics. Reports suggest a response rate of this indolent lymphoma to antibiotic therapy for <em>C. psittaci</em> of 33 to 65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psittacosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

The liver enzymes are abnormal in approximately half of hospitalized patients, usually with mild elevation of the aspartate transaminase (AST) and low serum albumin levels. Hyponatremia is quite common, as is mild elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen.

These subsequently change back to elementary bodies that are released to infect other cells in the same individual or to infect others.</p><p>At the macroscopic level, the lungs have patchy consolidation that may be lobar or lobular.

Birds are the primary reservoir, but transmission from other animals has also been reported. The disease usually occurs sporadically, but outbreaks caused by contact with an infected bird are not uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Humans are usually infected by inhalation of organisms in dried feces when caged birds exercise their wings or in bird feather dust. Cage cleaning may pose an infection risk. Bird bites, mouth to beak contact, and even transient exposure, such as visiting a bird park, have also been implicated in the transmission of this infection. The incubation period is usually 5 to 14 days.
