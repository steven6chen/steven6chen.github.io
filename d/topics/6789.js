If any ear discharge is noted after serious head trauma, particularly clear or bloody discharge, the patient should undergo evaluation for CSF otorrhea caused by a basilar temporal skull fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of middle ear trauma&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of ear or nose drainage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skull fractures in children: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Basilar skull fractures'</a>.)</p><p>Hemorrhagic otorrhea may also arise from middle ear trauma caused by a direct blow to the ear, auditory barotrauma, or intrusion of a foreign body into the external ear canal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of middle ear trauma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-barotrauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ear barotrauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Infectious complications of acute otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the mastoid air cells are connected to the distal end of the middle ear through a small canal or antrum, most episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) are associated with some inflammation of the mastoid. In rare cases, resolution of the mastoid infection does not occur, and acute mastoiditis develops with pus filling the air cells. The child with mastoiditis will have painful swelling behind the ear that typically pushes the pinna forward. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mastoiditis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mastoiditis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other intratemporal complications that occur by contiguous spread of infection include petrositis (Gradenigo syndrome with sixth nerve palsy) and labyrinthitis.</p><p>Intracranial complications of AOM are particularly a concern in children who appear ill. These complications include meningitis, epidural abscess, brain abscess, lateral sinus thrombosis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, subdural empyema, and carotid artery thrombosis. Patients with these illnesses usually develop fever and, over time, a toxic appearance; a few may manifest cranial nerve deficits, especially cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) and less commonly, cranial nerve VI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Intracranial complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Necrotizing otitis externa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Also called malignant external otitis, this is a complication of bacterial otitis externa. Infection of the skin gives way to deeper seeding of cartilage, tissue, and bone. As the infection advances, osteomyelitis of the base of the skull, temporomandibular joint osteomyelitis, brain abscess, and generalized bacterial sepsis can develop. Although most commonly seen in the elderly and adults with diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised children (eg, cancer patients on chemotherapy or HIV-infected patients) are at risk.</p><p>Patients with malignant external otitis classically present with otorrhea and exquisite otalgia which are not responsive to topical measures used to treat simple external otitis. The pain is generally more severe than that found in simple external otitis, although the two may be difficult to distinguish in their early stages. The pain in malignant external otitis tends to extend into the temporomandibular joint, resulting in pain with chewing.</p><p>On physical examination, purulent otorrhea is seen in more than half of cases, and ipsilateral lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy can be present as well. Granulation tissue may be visible in the inferior portion of the external auditory canal at the bone-cartilage junction (at the site of Santorini's fissures).This finding may be absent in atypical patients (eg, HIV-infected patients and children). Early empiric antibiotic therapy and otolaryngology consultation are essential to good outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-necrotizing-external-otitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant (necrotizing) external otitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Neoplasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer is a rare cause of otorrhea but should be considered in patients with abnormal tissue growth in the ear canal or a lack of response to prolonged external otitis treatment. These patients warrant prompt referral to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist with pediatric expertise.</p><p>Ear canal cancer occurs far less frequently than auricular cancer, although the presentation and behavior are more sinister. In the early stages it is often indistinguishable from external otitis. In addition, rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma may manifest as auditory canal tumors in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Carcinoma of the ear canal'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging evaluation of neuroblastoma&quot;, section on 'Metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Common conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otorrhea in children is often caused by one of several more benign diseases. Clinical findings with cleansing of debris will differentiate among most of these etiologies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacterial otitis externa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute bacterial external otitis, often called &quot;swimmer's ear,&quot; is an infectious inflammation of the external auditory canal. History often includes either water exposure or instrumentation with damage to the outer ear canal (such as cleaning with cotton swabs or finger scratching). Common symptoms include pain, pruritus, and hearing loss. Minor trauma to the canal's protective skin barrier and protective cerumen layer allows for bacterial overgrowth. Otitis externa is most commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, polymicrobial and anaerobic infections can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-including-swimmers-ear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: External otitis (including swimmer's ear) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H191116177\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>On physical examination, moderate to severe pain with minor tragus manipulation or pulling on the auricle is classic. An erythematous, edematous ear canal with cellular debris is seen. Since the middle ear is not necessarily involved in external otitis, there may not be any middle ear effusion or purulent otitis media. When visible, the tympanic membrane (TM) itself is typically erythematous or covered with debris. Often the membrane is difficult to see due to edematous narrowing of the canal. Otorrhea is purulent, white to yellow, and may dry to a crust.</p><p>Patients with severe forms of otitis externa may also have fever, regional lymphadenopathy, or erythema of the pinna. If the pinna is infected, very aggressive treatment may be necessary such as admission for intravenous antibiotics, topical soaks, and surgical debridement. It is important to make the distinction between a generalized cellulitis of the skin of the pinna and a more serious cartilage infection such as perichondritis or chondritis. This distinction may be made by inspecting the lobule, which has no cartilage. If the lobule is spared, but the rest of the pinna is erythematous, this suggests involvement of the pinna cartilage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infections-of-the-eye-ear-urinary-tract-gastrointestinal-tract-and-central-nervous-system#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections of the eye, ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system&quot;, section on 'Perichondritis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H277656\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Malignant external otitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Foreign body</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ear foreign bodies (FBs) may cause otorrhea if they are long standing or consist of highly irritating substances. The history may or may not indicate their presence. </p><p>Typical foreign bodies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toys or small objects placed in the ear by toddlers, or placed into younger sibling's ears</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insects, although they are often so irritating that removal occurs before otorrhea develops</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food material, especially nuts with irritating oils that can cause a significant reaction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Button batteries (often used in small electronic devices such as hearing aids)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expelled tympanostomy tube with granulation tissue and bloody otorrhea (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Tympanostomy tube drainage'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Button batteries require emergent removal because pressure necrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe burns from residual electric current or leakage of caustic contents may rapidly lead to extensive damage to adjacent structures.</p><p>Otoscopy is diagnostic. However, cerumen buildup or otorrhea may obscure the object, and cleaning may be necessary before the FB can be seen. Most ear FBs that do not cause otorrhea can be removed using simple techniques in the outpatient setting without referral to an ENT specialist. However, complications do result from multiple manipulations, and an ENT consult should be called when in doubt or when necessary visualization and removal equipment are not available. </p><p>In patients with FBs that cause otorrhea, visualization and removal can be extremely difficult and must be done with care. Unless the clinician ensures visualization of the object and has the proper tools and setting (including the ability to restrain and possibly sedate the child), referral to an ENT specialist with audiometry is warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-foreign-bodies-of-the-outer-ear\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of foreign bodies of the outer ear&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, the tympanic membrane will rupture in the course of acute otitis media. This is usually associated with ear pain and fever of relatively short duration, followed by pain relief associated with the onset of otorrhea. The drainage often has a clear or white appearance. By the time the patient is seen, the perforation may have healed, but the drainage may continue for some time, especially if otitis externa has developed. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Bacterial otitis externa'</a> above.)</p><p>Often the perforation itself may not be visible on otoscopy because the otorrhea obscures visualization of the tympanic membrane (TM) or the perforation has rapidly resealed. When seen, the TM typically has abnormal appearance and lack of mobility on pneumatic otoscopy. If the perforation is of recent origin, it generally heals spontaneously once the infection resolves. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Tympanic membrane perforation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment#H49926436\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'AOM with perforation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic suppurative otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), or chronic otomastoiditis, is a perforation of the eardrum with chronic drainage from the middle ear cleft. This condition is more frequently seen in children who lack access to health care and, thus, do not have timely diagnosis and treatment of acute otitis media. It should not be confused with longstanding otitis media with effusion (OME, or &quot;serous&quot; otitis media), or persistent acute otitis media, both of which involve an intact tympanic membrane and no drainage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>CSOM is often painless. On examination, a debris-filled canal is noted. The discharge is often white to yellow, and mixed with soft cerumen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are common pathogens. Treatment typically consists of topical antibiotic ear drops, with topical quinolones being the best studied treatment choice. Parenteral antibiotic administration guided by culture of the ear discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tympanomastoidectomy may be necessary in refractory cases, though the evidence for superiority of systemic antibiotics over topical quinolone antibiotics is mixed and not convincing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-otorrhea-ear-discharge-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These refractory cases should be pursued in consultation with an ENT specialist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Cerumen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Annoying to many parents, but generally harmless, some children have thin cerumen that can present as ear drainage. In general, cerumen is only a problem if it is impacted or if it precludes examination of the eardrum. In such cases, removal may be necessary, but precautions should be taken when instrumenting the ear canal. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'External auditory canal cleaning'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Tympanostomy tube drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ten to 30 percent of children with tympanostomy tubes will have at least one episode of acute otorrhea while their tympanostomy tubes are in place, either immediately postoperatively or during an episode of acute otitis media. The drainage is usually foul smelling, mucoid, and may be mixed with blood. It is generally treated with antibiotic drops. Suction cleaning of the ear canal may be needed for drops to be effective. Rarely, systemic antibiotics or even mastoid surgery is needed if the drainage is persistent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tympanostomy-tube-otorrhea-in-children-causes-prevention-and-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tympanostomy tube otorrhea in children: Causes, prevention, and management&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Other conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less commonly, otorrhea may arise from the following conditions:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Contact dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical medications or cosmetics may cause local irritation and inflammation with ear drainage. A typical history reveals the offending agent being used, often for a pre-existing condition such as otitis externa or cerumen impaction. Pruritus, pain, and inflammation on examination accompany the otorrhea. Treatment consists of topical corticosteroids and avoidance of the allergen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Contact dermatitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Bullous myringitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often associated with respiratory symptoms or acute otitis media, bullous myringitis describes serous liquid-filled blisters, or &quot;bullae,&quot; on the tympanic membrane. When the bullae rupture, thin bloody otorrhea may occur and pain is often relieved. The external ear canal is not typically involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Bullous myringitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Granulation tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulation tissue can develop in a number of conditions and can be associated with otorrhea. As mentioned previously, this tissue can accumulate around a foreign body (such as a tympanostomy tube). It can also be seen in granulomatous disease (such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis), or in chronic inflammatory conditions (such as chronic otitis media). The rich vascular supply can also lead to leakage of lymphatic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-otorrhea-ear-discharge-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyps in the external ear canal may occur in response to an inflammatory reaction or infection such as chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, or retained foreign body (eg, expelled tympanostomy tube) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-otorrhea-ear-discharge-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Rarely, they may arise from a tumor (eg, Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis, teratoma, neoplasm). Polyps create bloody or serous otorrhea, generally when manipulated, similar to granulomas. Ear polyps may resolve rapidly with topical antibiotic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-inflammatory therapy. However, if drainage persists for more than two to three weeks, the child should be referred to an ENT specialist with pediatric expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-otorrhea-ear-discharge-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Otomycosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otomycosis is a fungal infection of the external auditory canal and a common reason for external otitis treatment failure. Patients with fungal external otitis most commonly report itching, a feeling that something is in the ear canal, discomfort, and discharge. Otorrhea is generally thick and purulent. Deep seated itching is the most troublesome symptom; pain is less intense than with bacterial otitis externa. Fungal organisms have a very characteristic appearance in the ear canal, especially under magnified vision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56232\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56232 \">picture 1</a>). The clinical manifestations and treatment of otomycosis are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Otomycosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">First branchial cleft cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first branchial pouch arises in the pharynx and extends laterally and cephalad to contact the first branchial cleft, forming the eustachian tube. Rarely, congenitally anomalous first branchial cleft cysts may drain into the external ear canal. A mass in the periauricular region may suggest this diagnosis in the face of chronic drainage with a normal tympanic membrane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Cholesteatoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cholesteatoma (sometimes called a keratoma) is an abnormal growth of squamous epithelium. These can occur in the middle ear and mastoid (middle ear cholesteatoma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72870\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72870 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59937\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59937 \">picture 3</a>), or more rarely, in the ear canal itself (external ear canal cholesteatoma). It may progressively enlarge to surround and destroy the ossicles, resulting in conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss also may occur if the cholesteatoma obstructs the eustachian tube orifice, leading to middle ear effusion. Surgical therapy is required for most cholesteatomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholesteatoma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholesteatoma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5013267\"><span class=\"h3\">Keratosis obturans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Keratosis obturans is an accumulation of desquamated keratin in the external auditory meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-otorrhea-ear-discharge-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Unlike cholesteatoma, keratosis obturans is associated with an expanded ear canal as keratin is shed from the complete circumference of the canal, and does not cause osteonecrosis. When compared to cholesteatoma, keratosis obturans is generally more acute and painful, produces less otorrhea, and generally occurs in younger patients. It can often be managed with removal of the keratin plug, antibiotic ear drops, and periodic follow-up to remove any reaccumulated debris. Operative care is typically not needed. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid otorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to basilar skull fractures from head trauma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea may also occur spontaneously through tegmen tympani defects in the floor of the temporal bone. These defects should be suspected in cases of persistent otorrhea after the more common causes have already been excluded or in any child with more than one episode of meningitis. High resolution computed tomography (CT) with thin cuts through the temporal bone provides a noninvasive means of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-otorrhea-ear-discharge-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3555322238\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following historical features should be sought in patients with otorrhea:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Features of drainage &ndash; Onset, duration, color, and consistency help distinguish among the etiologies of otorrhea.

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Contact dermatitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous treatments &ndash; A draining ear that persists despite antibiotic treatment may indicate chronic suppurative otitis, otomycosis, or noninfectious causes of otorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the ear requires inspection of the auricle and surrounding area, otoscopy of the external canal, tympanic membrane, and middle ear, and, in patients without obvious tympanic membrane perforation, assessment of tympanic membrane function by pneumatic otoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70700\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef70700 \">movie 1</a>). In children with otorrhea, the external auditory canal is often filled with debris and requires cleaning to allow proper visualization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">External auditory canal cleaning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, no cleaning is necessary to make a diagnosis of otitis externa or otitis media with perforation. Not infrequently, however, removal of a small amount of debris enhances the view of the examiner, and this can be achieved using a cotton pledget wrapped tightly around a curette or a wick to soak up excess fluid. Less often, cleaning through a standard otoscope head may be required to eliminate profuse, thick exudate totally obscuring the view of the examiner, using a suction catheter or careful curettage. Care must be used when curetting so that iatrogenic canal or tympanic membrane trauma does not occur. Thorough cleaning is best done under direct visualization with use of either an otoscope with an operating head or an otologic microscope.</p><p>Some practitioners will use irrigation to remove cerumen, but this should only be done if a patient is known to have an intact tympanic membrane. Otherwise, irrigation of a draining ear is potentially dangerous and should not be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient examination should focus on the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head trauma &ndash; Any obvious head trauma or signs of basilar skull fracture (eg, raccoon eyes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69662\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69662 \">picture 4</a>), Battle sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69660 \">picture 5</a>)) should raise suspicion for cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Traumatic cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tragal motion tenderness &ndash; Pain with manipulation of the tragus or gentle traction on the auricle of the outer ear is a classic sign of bacterial otitis externa. However, some pain with manipulation may be present with any condition that generates inflammation of the external canal. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Bacterial otitis externa'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foreign body &ndash; A foreign body (FB) found in the canal may be the source of a child's otorrhea and requires time to cause drainage. A child rarely may place something in the ear in an attempt to relieve symptoms from a pre-existing ear condition. Thus, after removal of the foreign body, careful otoscopic evaluation is important to exclude other coincidental disease or complications, such as tympanic membrane perforation. Care must be taken not to cause further injury during FB removal; any FB that is difficult to remove should be referred to an ENT specialist. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Foreign body'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organic mass or polyp &ndash; Polypoid masses or granulomas most often arise in response to chronic otitis media, foreign bodies in the external ear canal, or cholesteatoma. Rarely, they may arise from a neoplastic process. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Polyps'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neoplasm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of discharge &ndash; Thin white debris-filled discharge is typical of bacterial otitis externa. Tympanic perforation generally leads to a mucous discharge as does contact dermatitis. CSF otorrhea is a clear or thin bloody discharge that may be mistaken for more benign serous fluid. Purulent discharge can be from severe irritation, foreign body, middle ear infection, or severe external canal infections. Blood-tinged discharge is more likely caused by trauma, foreign body, granuloma, or carcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation &ndash; Inflammation of the tympanic membrane is indicative of middle ear pathology. Inflammation of the external canal can occur with many conditions, but it is less likely with isolated middle ear infections with or without TM perforations. An edematous, erythematous external canal with debris and a generally clear tympanic membrane is typical of bacterial otitis externa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tympanic membrane &ndash; The tympanic membrane should be carefully inspected for signs of middle ear infection, such as injection, dullness, and bulging. Perforation, bullae, and evidence of trauma are additional important findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Otoscopy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-middle-ear-trauma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of middle ear trauma&quot;, section on 'Findings of middle ear injury'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>History and physical examination are sufficient to diagnose and manage most causes of otorrhea in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Culture of ear drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culture of the external ear canal in otorrhea is rarely helpful, as Pseudomonas species are commonly identified with or without local infection. It is also quite difficult to obtain samples from the middle ear that are not contaminated by external canal flora. In addition, culture rarely changes management decisions in children with otorrhea.</p><p>Indications for culture of ear drainage include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected necrotizing otitis externa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otitis media with chronic drainage, where previous treatment has failed</p><p/><p>When ear drainage culture is needed, an otolaryngology consultation is often necessary to obtain a proper specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-otorrhea-ear-discharge-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing for cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To test for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, the clinician may perform a quick bedside test by placing a drop of ear drainage on filter paper (coffee filter or paper towel). A rapidly advancing &quot;halo&quot; or ring of clear fluid around red blood defines a positive test. However, the halo test does NOT differentiate among CSF, saline, saliva, and other clear fluids and has not been formally studied in a clinical setting.</p><p>Alternatively, the clinician may test the ear or nose drainage for beta2 transferrin, a desialylated form of the protein, transferrin, which is almost exclusively found in CSF. This test is not available at many institutions.</p><p>Urine dipsticks have also been used to determine the presence of CSF by checking for the presence of glucose. However, this approach is NOT reliable because both blood and CSF contain glucose.</p><p>When in doubt about the presence of a CSF leak, it is best to obtain urgent neurosurgical consultation.

In a stable, non-toxic patient, a systematic approach should start with a thorough history.

On examination of the tympanic membrane, bullous myringitis appears as multiple intact or ruptured blisters on the membrane itself, with possible middle ear inflammation behind. Granular myringitis can also be diagnosed on examination with visualization of the typical vascular, friable mass. A perforated tympanic membrane makes middle ear pathology the most likely source of the otorrhea.</p><p>Debris in acute otitis media with perforation may make visualization of the tympanic membrane difficult, so other signs of otitis media such as fever and pain preceding the drainage may lead to the diagnosis of acute otitis media with perforation. A non-inflamed tympanic membrane with serous drainage through a perforation is likely chronic serous otitis media (CSOM), especially in an otherwise asymptomatic child. Although extremely rare, spontaneous CSF otorrhea has been described and should be considered when other more common causes of otorrhea have been excluded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflamed external canal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An inflamed, edematous canal is typically associated with diseases external to the tympanic membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81237\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81237 \">algorithm 2</a>). After carefully clearing debris as needed, the examiner should check for a foreign body. A nonorganic foreign body can cause otorrhea when associated with concurrent irritation and inflammation. An organic appearing foreign body or growth in the ear suggests an inflammatory granuloma, polyp, otomycosis, carcinoma, or cholesteatoma. These masses each have their own characteristic appearance as described above.</p><p>An inflamed, edematous, debris-filled canal with no foreign body is typical of contact dermatitis and otitis externa. History of moisture exposure or minor trauma differentiates infectious otitis externa from contact dermatitis, which is associated with exposure of the ear to some topical medications, cosmetics, or plants. Otitis externa also tends to be more painful with outer ear manipulation, though contact dermatitis can become painful when severe as well. Pruritus is typical with both diagnoses. The clinician should carefully check for pinna and cartilaginous involvement of severe otitis externa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1423753763\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIALIST REFERRAL OR CONSULTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend prompt consultation with a pediatric ear, nose, and throat specialist for patients with otorrhea and the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF otorrhea (in addition to trauma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurosurgical consultation if caused by trauma)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mastoiditis or other infectious complications of acute otitis media</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Auditory ear canal mass</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrotizing otitis externa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Button battery foreign body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital anomalies of the middle ear or ear canal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunodeficiency predisposing to severe infection</p><p/><p/><p>Referral to a pediatric ENT specialist is warranted for patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic otorrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholesteatoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otomycosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First branchial cleft cyst</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
