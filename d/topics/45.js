Over the history of medicine, there has been a wide range of poorly defined terminology used to describe AUB symptoms and etiologies.</p><p>The beginning of conflicting terminology for AUB dates back to the late 1700s when William Cullen, Professor of Physic at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, began to write his medical research texts in English rather than in Latin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, he was fond of demonstrating his classical language skills to his students and coined the Latin term menorrhagia, meaning &quot;to burst forth monthly,&quot; to describe the excessive bleeding that many of his patients experienced. The term dysfunctional uterine bleeding was coined, but never clearly defined, by Graves in 1935 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The varied use of terminology to describe AUB symptoms has led to difficulties in many areas, including documenting symptoms; reaching consensus on the use of various diagnostic techniques and medical and surgical therapies; design and interpretation of basic, translational, and clinical research; and attempts to conduct multicenter or multinational clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/1,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-6</a>].</p><p>These concerns led to the formation of the Menstrual Disorders Working Group within the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), which has subsequently become a standing committee, the Menstrual Disorders Committee. This group has developed internationally supported recommendations on definitions and terminology for AUB symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/1,4,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6-8</a>] as well as a new classification of underlying causes of AUB in the reproductive years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Together, these terminology and classification systems provide the tools to improve precision in communicating about etiologies, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of AUB in the reproductive years.</p><p>The terminology for AUB symptoms as well as the FIGO system for classification of AUB etiologies are reviewed here. The differential diagnosis and approach to the evaluation of AUB are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-genital-tract-bleeding-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of genital tract bleeding in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis and management of girls with premenarcheal bleeding, women with postmenopausal bleeding, and bleeding associated with pregnancy are discussed elsewhere.

The workshop addressed the most obvious and confusing issues regarding AUB terminology, definitions, and classifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/1,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6,7</a>]. As a result of this workshop, an international working group was set up with oversight from the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics via a Menstrual Disorders Working Group (FIGO MDWG), and since 2012, this working group has become a standing committee of FIGO, the FIGO Menstrual Disorders Committee (MDC).</p><p>The goals of the MDC include development of a system for defining and describing both normal uterine bleeding and AUB as well as one for the classification of potential causes of AUB in the reproductive years. The system for AUB terminology was created in a clearly defined fashion; written in simple English words that can be easily translated into other languages; and readily understood by clinicians, patients, and researchers alike [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Where possible, the definitions were based on data derived from population-based studies. The classification system allows the investigator, clinician, or educator to consider all possible causes or contributors to the AUB in a given patient, understanding that some imaged lesions may indeed be asymptomatic. For both the terminology and classification systems, it is understood that with increased future knowledge of menstrual physiology and the pathogenesis of AUB, modifications may be necessary to maintain their relevance for clinicians, educators, and investigators.</p><p>The process of developing new definitions and terminology has included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying terms describing AUB symptoms that should no longer be used because they are confusing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poorly defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/1,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6,7</a>]. A range of terms was identified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among the most commonly used terms were <strong>menorrhagia</strong> and <strong>metrorrhagia</strong>. Menorrhagia was never clearly defined and has been used in various ways to describe heavy uterine bleeding symptoms (regardless of context &ndash; predictable cyclical, irregular, or unpredictable) and, for some clinicians and investigators, has even been used as a poorly defined diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The expert group also recommended abandonment of the term <strong>dysfunctional uterine bleeding</strong> (DUB), which is another poorly defined term. This term has been used with variability as both a vague symptom <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a poorly defined diagnosis. Mainly, the term DUB has been used as a diagnosis of exclusion in women with AUB in whom structural pathology has not been identified. However, scientific and diagnostic advances have now led to a better understanding of underlying mechanisms of these symptoms, thereby supporting a more defined set of actual causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/8,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11-13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional terms that are poorly defined and should no longer be used are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103237\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103237 \">table 1</a>). The FIGO MDC classification for etiologies is described below.

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Menstrual Disorders Committee (FIGO MDC) used an evidence-based approach to develop parameters of normal menstrual bleeding based upon published population data and using medians and confidence intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Anything outside these limits was regarded as AUB.</p><p>In reviewing data regarding normal menstrual function, there are several challenges. Different population studies provide some differences in data. There were some variations within &quot;normal populations&quot; in the regularity and frequency of menstrual bleeding when 5<sup>th</sup> to 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles were utilized. These have been taken into account in developing the definitions below. Little is known about cultural, ethnic, or geographic variations, since comparative large-scale studies have not been carried out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p>Issues of defining the limits of normal menstrual function have led to considerable ongoing debate and resulted in a major review at a FIGO MDC workshop in Vancouver in 2015 by a group of experts.

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Menstrual Disorders Committee (FIGO MDC) advised that the term oligomenorrhea be replaced by the term <strong>infrequent uterine bleeding</strong>.</p><p/><p>For girls or women who have previously had regular menstrual cycles, when there is no bleeding for six months, menstrual periods are categorized as absent, and the term <strong>secondary</strong> <strong>amenorrhea</strong> is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Since there is little controversy in the use or definition of the term secondary amenorrhea, the term has been retained. However, the duration of the period of amenorrhea should be specified. The FIGO MDC has agreed with this definition, but it is important to note that some experts would prefer to add a caveat that &quot;secondary amenorrhea is the absence of menses for more than three months in girls or women who previously had regular menstrual cycles or six months in girls or women who previously had irregular menses.&quot; The FIGO MDC felt making this part of the official definition would lead to a large number of young women with generally regular and normal menses being classified as &quot;abnormal.&quot;</p><p>Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menarche by age 15 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-primary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of primary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4185444721\"><span class=\"h2\">Regularity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creating a working definition of regular menstrual bleeding is challenging. Based on data from multiple studies, &quot;normal&quot; menses should occur at regular and reasonably predictable intervals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109657\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109657 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p>For cycle length, the 5<sup>th</sup> to 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for the difference between the longest and shortest cycle over a one-year period should be no more than 20 days. However, the 20-day difference is based on the general population of women and includes those with occasional very short (&lt;18 days) and very long (&gt;43 days) cycles. Some women with long cycles may have had ovulatory dysfunction, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome. When these very short and very long cycles are excluded, the variation in cycle length is seven to nine days, depending upon age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Variation in cycle length is typically longer in younger women (ages 18 to 25 years) and women approaching the menopausal transition (ages 43 to 45 years) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107977 \">table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3332544441\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration (normal of days of bleeding in a single menstrual period) of normal menstruation in the population studies was up to eight days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109658\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109658 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/14,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17-20</a>]. Consequently, when the duration of a woman's menstrual periods is consistently more than eight days, the patient may be said to have <strong>prolonged menstrual bleeding</strong>. This phenomenon is often, but not always, associated with <strong>heavy menstrual bleeding</strong> (HMB). Since there is no consensus on the lower limit of normal for the duration of menses, for the present time, the MDC has determined that there is no clinically relevant definition of a &quot;shortened&quot; duration of bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1280385182\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term HMB is a symptom of a woman's perception of increased daily or total monthly menstrual volume of flow, regardless of the duration, the frequency, or whether the timing of onset is regular or irregular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F109659\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109659 \">figure 4</a>). For clinical purposes, the definition is subjective and defined as a volume that interferes with a woman's physical, social, emotional, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> material quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], the definition described in the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Typically, HMB is part of a symptom complex that may include variable degrees of dysmenorrhea, fatigue, and other symptoms.</p><p>Light menstrual bleeding is an infrequent complaint. For clinical purposes, this can only be based on a description or complaint by the patient. This symptom is uncommon and is only rarely related to pathology, although it may be a presenting symptom of cervical stenosis or intrauterine synechiae. Light menstrual bleeding is usually a complaint from women for whom a heavy, red bleed is a perceived sign of good health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>For research purposes, both HMB and light menstrual bleeding may be defined more objectively by direct or indirect methods for determining menstrual volume. The volumetric definition of HMB is &gt;80 mL vaginal &quot;blood&quot; loss per cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The referent technique is the measurement of actual blood loss per menstrual period, using the extraction of hemoglobin (alkaline hematin method) from menstrual sanitary towels, including pads and tampons, which have been carefully collected after detailed counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>]. The somewhat cumbersome and expensive nature of the alkaline hematin method has generated interest in the development of surrogate measures of menstrual volume, the most common technique being the semi-quantitative pictorial blood loss assessment charts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Both clinicians and researchers should also be aware that over 50 percent of the total menstrual loss is an endometrial transudate, and the whole blood component usually varies between 30 and 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-reproductive-age-women-terminology-and-palm-coein-etiology-classification/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

This symptom may be virtually impossible to discern if the woman has irregular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> very frequent menses.

Symptoms arising from lesions of the cervix and vagina are not covered in this discussion of AUB, but careful examination of the vagina and cervix is important before assuming that the abnormal bleeding arises from the endometrium or cervical canal.

(See <a href=\"#H974267975\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal menstruation is defined as (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F103238\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103238 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H283249570\" class=\"local\">'Normal menstruation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Frequency &ndash; 24 to 38 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Regularity &ndash; No more than seven to nine days difference between the shortest to longest cycles; cycle length is the number of days from the first day of one menstrual cycle to the first day of the next.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Duration &ndash; Up to eight days; duration is the number of days of bleeding in a single menstrual period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Volume &ndash; Clinical definition is subjective and defined as a volume that does not interfere with a woman's physical, social, emotional, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> material quality of life; research definition is &le;80 mL vaginal &quot;blood&quot; loss per cycle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AUB is the term used to describe any symptomatic variation from normal menstruation (in terms of frequency, regularity, duration, or volume) and also includes intermenstrual bleeding.
