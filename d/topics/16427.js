They tend to be shallow and cause oozing of blood from superficial capillary beds. Deeper lesions may also occur, which can erode into the submucosa and cause massive hemorrhage or perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors, and prognosis of stress ulceration in the intensive care unit (ICU) are discussed in this topic review. In addition, stress ulcer prophylaxis is reviewed. Diagnosis and treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers are discussed separately.

Most episodes of overt GI bleeding in critically ill patients are due to gastric or esophageal ulceration, as determined by endoscopic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Stress ulceration can also cause perforation. However, this complication is rare, occurring in fewer than 1 percent of surgical ICU patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress ulceration generally begins in the proximal regions of the stomach within hours of major trauma or serious illness. Endoscopy performed within 72 hours of a major burn or cranial trauma reveals acute mucosal abnormalities in greater than 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Up to 50 percent of such lesions have endoscopic evidence of recent or ongoing bleeding, although only a small percentage of patients experience hemodynamic compromise due to acute blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Stress ulcerations that develop after the first several days of hospitalization tend to be deeper and more distal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a study of 67 patients with GI bleeding that occurred an average of 14 days after admission, duodenal ulceration was the most common source of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>It is uncertain if early and late stress ulcerations have the same pathophysiology. However, both types probably result from an imbalance between mucosal protection and gastric acid production.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired mucosal protection &ndash; The stomach is normally protected by a glycoprotein mucous layer that forms a physical barrier to hydrogen ion diffusion and traps bicarbonate. The bicarbonate neutralizes gastric acid adjacent to the stomach wall. This barrier may be denuded by increased concentrations of refluxed bile salts or uremic toxins, which are common in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In addition, its synthesis may be decreased when there is poor gut perfusion caused by shock, sepsis, or trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypersecretion of acid &ndash; Hypersecretion of acid due to excessive gastrin stimulation of parietal cells has been detected in patients with head trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. This abnormality is probably not a factor in all ICU patients, since acid secretion tends to be normal or subnormal in most other patients.</p><p/><p>H. pylori infection may also contribute to stress ulceration, but the evidence is of limited quality. A case-control study of 50 ICU patients found that patients with GI bleeding were more likely to have H. pylori infection than patients without acute GI bleeding (36 versus 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Conversely, another observational study of 99 ICU patients found that patients with H. pylori infection were more likely to have GI bleeding than patients without H. pylori infection (23 versus 13 percent), although the difference did not reach statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multicenter prospective cohort study of 2252 ICU patients identified two major risk factors for clinically important GI bleeding (defined as overt GI bleeding leading to hemodynamic deterioration or requiring blood transfusion) due to stress ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours (odds ratio 15.6)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulopathy (odds ratio 4.3)</p><p/><p>The incidence of clinically important GI bleeding among patients with one or both of these risk factors was 3.7 percent, compared to 0.1 percent among patients with neither risk factor.</p><p>Smaller studies have reported additional risk factors for stress ulceration, including shock, sepsis, hepatic failure, renal failure, multiple trauma, burns over 35 percent of total body surface area, organ transplantation, head trauma, spinal trauma, a history of peptic ulcer disease, and a history of upper GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1,4,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,19-21</a>].</p><p>Glucocorticoid therapy is commonly cited as an indication for stress ulcer prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, glucocorticoid therapy alone has not been conclusively shown to be a risk factor for stress ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Glucocorticoid therapy may increase the risk of stress ulceration when combined with other risk factors for GI ulceration, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94118939\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress ulcers usually suspected in patients who present with hematemesis (eg, coffee grounds or frank blood observed in nasogastric aspirate), melena, or anemia noted on routine laboratory testing. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by the visualization of superficial erosions in the gastric mucosa on endoscopic evaluation. They are usually shallow, well-demarcated, and primarily involve the superficial layers of the gastric epithelium. Additional details on the clinical manifestations and evaluation of patients with suspected peptic ulcer disease is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overt GI bleeding due to stress ulceration is associated with increased mortality. In the prospective cohort study described above, mortality was higher among ICU patients with clinically important GI bleeding than among those without bleeding (49 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Another study used four different statistical models to adjust for confounders and found that overt GI bleeding was associated with increased mortality using three of the models (relative risk ranged from 1.8 to 4.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPHYLAXIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H929814\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon randomized trials and guideline recommendations, stress ulcer prophylaxis should be administered to all critically ill patients who are at high risk for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Although there is disagreement about which clinical characteristics define high risk, we and others believe this includes patients with any of the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulopathy, defined as a platelet count &lt;50,000 per m<sup>3</sup>, an International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt;1.5, or a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt;2 times the control value</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation for &gt;48 hours</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of GI ulceration or bleeding within the past year</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traumatic brain injury, traumatic spinal cord injury, or burn injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two or more of the following minor criteria: sepsis, an intensive care unit (ICU) stay more than one week, occult GI bleeding for six or more days, or glucocorticoid therapy (more than 250 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> or the equivalent)</p><p/><p>Among patients who are not considered high risk for GI bleeding, we believe that stress ulcer prophylaxis should be administered on a case-by-case basis. Among the considerations are whether the patient is receiving enteral nutrition, how long the patient is expected to be without enteral nutrition, the severity of the patient&rsquo;s illness, and the patient&rsquo;s comorbidities.</p><p>Evidence to support this practice is based upon guidelines that were developed from randomized trials that compared prophylaxis to no prophylaxis using clinically important GI bleeding as an endpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In addition, many clinicians also provide stress ulcer prophylaxis to patients with traumatic brain injury, traumatic spinal cord injury, or thermal injury (&gt;35 percent of the body surface area) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Their rationale is that such patients have been routinely excluded from studies of stress ulcer prophylaxis because of a presumed high risk of stress ulceration. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>It is frequently asked whether a patient who is receiving enteral nutrition also requires pharmacological stress ulcer prophylaxis. This question is based upon reports that enteral nutrition alone may reduce the risk of overt GI bleeding due to stress ulceration and that stress ulcer prophylaxis may be ineffective or harmful among patients who are receiving enteral nutrition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteral nutrition alone may reduce the risk of overt GI bleeding due to stress ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]: In one observational study performed using data from a randomized trial, enteral nutrition independently reduced overt GI bleeding (relative risk 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.67) in 1077 critically ill patients who were mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Another observational study of 526 patients in a burn ICU found that the incidence of overt GI bleeding was lower among patients who received early enteral nutrition alone than among patients who received a histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2 blocker) without early enteral nutrition (3 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. While these observational data suggest that enteral nutrition may be an adequate substitute for pharmacologic stress ulcer prophylaxis in ICU patients, controlled clinical trials are necessary for confirmation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacological stress ulcer prophylaxis may be ineffective or harmful among patients who are receiving enteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]: A quantitative systematic review of randomized trials comparing H2 blockers to placebo for the prevention of stress ulceration found that the effect of the H2 blockers varied according to whether the patients were receiving early enteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Among patients not receiving early enteral nutrition, H2 blockers reduced the incidence of GI bleeding and had no significant effect on mortality or the rate of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Among patients receiving early enteral nutrition, however, H2 blockers increased mortality and the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia, without reducing the rate of GI bleeding. This systematic review had several important limitations. Among the limitations, it included both patients who are at high risk and low risk for stress ulceration. Thus, it is possible that the harmful effects of prophylaxis seen among patients receiving enteral nutrition were due to unnecessary prophylaxis in low risk patients, rather than a more general harmful effect among all patients.</p><p/><p>While such reports are thought provoking and warrant further study, we believe that the evidence is insufficient to justify withholding stress ulcer prophylaxis from patients who are at high risk for gastrointestinal bleeding even if they are receiving enteral nutrition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H561022379\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing an agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal agent for acid suppression is unknown. Controversy and substantial variation exists in practice over agent selection for acid suppression in critically ill patients. Our practice is the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For critically ill patients who are able to receive enteral medications and in whom stress ulcer prophylaxis is indicated, an oral proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is preferred rather than an alternative prophylactic agent (eg, histamine-2 receptor antagonist [H2 blocker], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a>, or antacids). For patients in whom an oral PPI is not tolerated, an oral H2 blocker is an appropriate alternative. This preference is based upon some evidence that suggests that PPIs may be more efficacious. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For critically ill patients who cannot receive enteral medications, an intravenous histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2 blocker) or intravenous PPI can be administered. In particular, when cost is a consideration, some clinicians prefer intravenous H2 blockers (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famotidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famotidine</a>) arguing that the increase in efficacy of PPIs in this population is marginal, especially since the baseline risk of stress ulcer-related gastrointestinal bleeding is low (1 to 8 percent). In situations where cost is not an issue, an intravenous PPI is an appropriate choice. </p><p/><p>It is important to emphasize that this discussion is about prophylaxis. Patients who have active gastrointestinal bleeding require a different approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults#H5079594\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p>The choice of prophylactic agent depends upon the balance between efficacy and potential harm, as well as cost.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efficacy versus potential harm &ndash; Evidence from epidemiologic cohort studies indicates that although prophylactic agents, in particular H2 blockers and PPIs, effectively reduce the rate of GI bleeding in critically ill patients, they may also be associated with an increased rate of nosocomial pneumonia and <em>clostridium difficile</em> infection. In contrast, a less effective prophylactic agent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a>) may be associated with fewer infectious complications. We believe that in critically ill patients who are at risk, the benefits in the prevention of GI bleeding outweigh the risk of nosocomial infections. For this reason, in our clinical practice, we typically use H2 blockers or PPIs for stress ulcer prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Potential harms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cost &ndash; Choosing less expensive prophylactic agents or administering prophylaxis only to patients who are at high risk for stress ulceration can diminish the cost of stress ulcer prophylaxis:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Choosing less expensive prophylactic agents - One analysis found that prophylaxis with an oral PPI may be more cost-effective than intravenous H2 blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This was a consequence of the lower cost of oral medications and fewer treatment failures in the oral PPI group. Thus, we prefer the administration of an oral PPI rather than an intravenous H2 blocker or PPI, when feasible. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Administering prophylaxis only to patients who are at high risk for stress ulceration - It is estimated that only 30 patients who are at high risk for stress ulceration need to receive prophylaxis to prevent one GI bleed, compared to nearly 900 low risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This approach has the added advantage of decreasing the risk of adverse effects related to stress ulcer prophylaxis. Prophylaxis should be discontinued when the patient is no longer at risk for stress ulceration. Such prophylaxis is unnecessary because although prophylaxis reduces the rate of nosocomial gastrointestinal bleeding among non-critically ill patients when compared to no prophylaxis (odds ratio, 0.63), the baseline risk of bleeding in this population is low (0.29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Despite this, several studies have demonstrated a high rate of ongoing stress ulcer prophylaxis among patients who are discharged from the ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H929392\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic agents</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>H2 blockers</strong> &ndash; Histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers) antagonize the H2 receptors on the parietal cell, resulting in diminished gastric acid secretion.

They tend to be shallow and cause oozing of blood from superficial capillary beds. Deeper lesions may also occur, which can erode into the submucosa and cause massive hemorrhage, perforation, or both. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In critically ill patients, histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and antacids reduce overt gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding when compared to placebo or no prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For critically ill patients who have risk factors for stress ulceration, we recommend prophylaxis with agents that suppress gastric acid (eg, PPI, H2 blockers, antacid) rather than no prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Risk factors include the following: mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, coagulopathy, GI ulceration or bleeding within the past year, traumatic brain injury, traumatic spinal cord injury, severe burns &gt;35 percent of the body surface area, or two or more minor risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H929814\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For critically ill patients without any of the above risk factors, stress ulcer prophylaxis should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Considerations include whether the patient is receiving enteral nutrition, how long the patient is expected to be without enteral nutrition, the severity of the patient&rsquo;s illness, and the patient&rsquo;s comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H929814\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For critically ill patients who are able to receive enteral medications and in whom stress ulcer prophylaxis is indicated, we suggest an oral PPI rather than an alternative prophylactic agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H561022379\" class=\"local\">'Choosing an agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For critically ill patients who cannot receive enteral medications and in whom stress ulcer prophylaxis is indicated, we suggest an intravenous H2 blocker or an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Intravenous H2 blockers may be particularly preferred in those for whom cost is an issue. (See <a href=\"#H561022379\" class=\"local\">'Choosing an agent'</a> above and <a href=\"#H929392\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic agents that increase gastric pH (PPI, H2 blockers, antacids) may increase the frequency of nosocomial pneumonia, compared to prophylactic agents that do not alter gastric pH (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a>). PPIs and H2 blockers may also be associated with an increased risk of <em>clostridium difficile</em> infection. This risk should not preclude the administration of GI prophylaxis to critically ill patients, when it is indicated.
