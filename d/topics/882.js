The impact of isolated systolic hypertension on operative risk is less clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-hypertension#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of hypertension&quot;, section on 'Perioperative risks associated with hypertension'</a>.)</p><p>There is no known benefit from initiation of new therapy in the perioperative period to achieve normal BP values. Many patients with chronic hypertension are older adults with isolated systolic hypertension. Such patients may have low diastolic BP; therefore, aggressive attempts to lower systolic BP could result in profound diastolic hypotension, compromising vital organ perfusion. </p><p>Although rare, acute severe hypertension may indicate malignant underlying conditions such as pheochromocytoma, necessitating medical intervention before elective surgery, or changes in anesthetic management if surgery is emergent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3945241279\"><span class=\"h2\">Determination of target blood pressure values</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus regarding specific intraoperative BP target values. Also, it is not known which component of BP (eg, systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure [MAP]) should be targeted for monitoring and treatment during the intraoperative period. Lability of these BP values is likely during surgery, and either severe hypertension or severe hypotension may occur. Short-acting medications are administered to treat unacceptably high or low BP values, but treatment often results in undesirable large shifts in BP. </p><p>In general, rather than targeting a specific BP value, we attempt to maintain BP within 20 percent of the patient's baseline and keep MAP &gt;65 mmHg. This approach to targeting intraoperative BP was examined in a randomized trial in 298 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (82 percent had chronic hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The intervention group was treated to maintain systolic BP within 10 percent of the individual's normal resting baseline value, including use of a norepinephrine infusion to increase BP when necessary. The control group was treated to maintain systolic BP &ge;80 mmHg or to prevent a 40 percent decrease in BP below baseline. Attempting to maintain systolic BP within 10 percent of baseline led to fewer complications, defined as a composite of systemic inflammatory response syndrome with renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurologic dysfunction (relative risk 0.73; 95% CI 0.56-0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another study of 57,315 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, low MAP values (defined as MAP &lt;65 mmHg or a MAP that fell by more than 20 percent of the individual patient's baseline) were associated with myocardial and kidney injury, defined by elevations in troponin or creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Both myocardial and kidney injury were more likely in patients with chronic hypertension. </p><p>However, if the baseline MAP is high in a patient with chronic hypertension (eg, &gt;100 mmHg), then a MAP limit of 65 mmHg may be too low. As an example, in a trial of older adults with chronically elevated MAPs that were approximately 100 mmHg, targeting an intraoperative MAP of 80 to 95 mmHg produced a lower incidence of acute kidney injury compared with a lower target of 65 to 79 mmHg or a higher target of 96 to 110 mmHg (6.3 versus 13.5 and 12.9 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4138817733\"><span class=\"h2\">Decisions regarding blood pressure monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous BP monitoring with an intra-arterial catheter is often selected for hypertensive patients with coexisting coronary or cerebrovascular ischemic disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if the planned surgical procedure is likely to cause significant bleeding or fluid shifts.

Emerging technologies that enable continuous noninvasive BP monitoring may beneficially supplement intermittent BP readings to reduce delays in recognition of hypotension and improve maintenance of BP stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

This is particularly important for beta blockers and centrally acting sympatholytic drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a>) since these agents are associated with acute withdrawal syndromes that may lead to perioperative hypertensive events.

Although controversial, many centers routinely withhold ACE inhibitor and ARB antihypertensive agents for 24 hours before surgery or administer the evening dose before elective surgery (but not on the morning of surgery), particularly if significant perioperative fluid shifts are anticipated. In a systematic review that included mostly observational data, withholding these agents on the morning of noncardiac surgery was associated with a decreased incidence of intraoperative hypotension compared with administration (23 versus 30 percent; odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.47-0.85) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, all-cause mortality or major cardiovascular events were similar in both patient groups. &#160;</p><p>Some experts suggest a similar approach for patients with coexisting heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, since the benefits of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in such patients are due to chronic therapy. We suggest individualizing these decisions based on the indications for the drug, the patient's preoperative BP, and the planned type of surgery and anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Notably, postoperative hypertension is more likely if ACE inhibitors or ARBs are withheld on the day of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and failure to restart these agents within 48 hours after surgery has been associated with increased 30-day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-hypertension/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Typically, short-acting agents are preferred to avoid overtreatment and consequent hypotension (eg, a beta blocker such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a> 10 to 50 mg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> 5 to 20 mg, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> 1 to 5 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a vasodilating agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a> 100 to 500 mcg or nitroglycerine 4 to 25 mcg). In some cases, continuous infusion of an antihypertensive agent is necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F96387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96387 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1103379729\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common causes of acute intraoperative increases in BP include sympathetic stimulation during laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, surgical stimulation, emergence and tracheal extubation, hypercarbia or hypoxemia, or withdrawal of antihypertensive medications. (See <a href=\"#H519832689\" class=\"local\">'Causes and management of intraoperative hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial treatment of hypotensive episodes typically includes IV isotonic crystalloid solution administered in 250- to 500-mL increments. If necessary, an IV <span class=\"nowrap\">vasopressor/inotropic</span> agent is administered to increase BP. Typically, small doses of short-acting agents are preferred to avoid overtreatment and consequent hypertension (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> 40- to 100-mcg increments or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> 5- to 10-mg increments). For severe or refractory hypotension, a <span class=\"nowrap\">vasopressor/inotropic</span> infusion may be necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F96387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96387 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1067300824\" class=\"local\">'Consequences of intraoperative hypotension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common causes of intraoperative hypotension include hypovolemia, sympathetic inhibition due to administration of anesthetic agents, neuraxial blockade, inhibition of the renin angiotensin system due to chronic ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, or recent administration of an IV antihypertensive agent. Perioperative myocardial infarction or acute heart failure is more likely if the patient has coexisting cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H1222554103\" class=\"local\">'Causes and management of intraoperative hypotension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) is typically treated if systolic BP is &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic BP is &gt;110 mmHg. Common causes include noxious stimuli (eg, pain, nausea and vomiting, hypoxemia or hypercarbia, delirium with agitation, hypothermia with shivering, bladder distention), hypervolemia, withdrawal from alcohol or opioids, or recent use of cocaine, amphetamine, or phencyclidine. Also, undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with hypercarbia and hypoxemia may exacerbate preexisting hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H1897158226\" class=\"local\">'Initial assessment and treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H421075218\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of underlying causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative oral antihypertensive therapy should be reinstituted in the PACU or as soon as possible, or an IV equivalent may be administered if the patient cannot take oral medications. (See <a href=\"#H3938840320\" class=\"local\">'Reinstitution of antihypertensive medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension in the PACU is typically treated when the systolic BP is &lt;90 mmHg, mean BP is &lt;65 mmHg, or relative BP decrease is &gt;20 percent below baseline. In particular, effects of chronically or recently administered antihypertensive agents or neuraxial blockade due to dosing of an epidural catheter may cause postoperative hypotension once painful surgical stimulation has ceased. Other common causes of postoperative hypotension are similar to those in normotensive patients (eg, hypovolemia due to inadequate intraoperative fluid replacement or blood loss).
