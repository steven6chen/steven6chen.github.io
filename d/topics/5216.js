Prosthetic valve obstruction is identified as a mean transvalvular gradient increase by &gt;50 percent (or &gt;10 mmHg increase for an aortic prosthesis) compared with baseline, after exclusion of other causes such as a high-output state.

Three-dimensional (3D) TEE is suggested when available, as it may detect prosthetic thrombi that are missed or only partially visualized by two-dimensional (2D) TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>TEE is helpful in the assessment of mechanical mitral valves because thrombus is sometimes also located on the left atrial side of the valve and thus may be seen on TEE imaging. However, TEE is less useful for evaluation of mechanical aortic valve prostheses (particularly bileaflet valves and when more than one mechanical prosthesis is in place) because the posterior aspect of the valve shadows the valve itself in esophageal views; transgastric views may be helpful for assessing leaflet motion. </p><p>If there are indeterminate TEE findings (eg, absence of mass in a patient with an aortic valve prosthesis, presence of an intermediate or high intensity ratio mass, or suboptimally visualized mitral valve prosthesis), then MDCT may be helpful in visualizing thrombus or pannus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2695019399\"><span class=\"h5\">Multidetector computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MDCT enables assessment of prosthetic valve leaflet appearance and motion and features of thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. MDCT and fluoroscopy correlate well in identifying restricted leaflet motion, but MDCT further enables assessment of paravalvular masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. MDCT is also helpful for identifying alternative diagnoses (similar to TEE), as it can identify vegetations with accuracy approaching that of TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and MDCT with a delayed imaging acquisition protocol can identify atrial thrombi with accuracy nearing that of TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, thin, highly mobile masses may be challenging to detect by MDCT given its temporal resolution.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

For patients with a thromboembolic event, comprehensive evaluation for alternative causes should be conducted. (See <a href=\"#H462627841\" class=\"local\">'Approach to further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice between TEE and MDCT as the next imaging test after TTE is made based upon availability, prior test results, patient characteristics, mechanical valve location, and clinician experience.
