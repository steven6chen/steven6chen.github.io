The sinuses are hollow areas in the bones of the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75045 \">figure 1</a>). Polyps usually occur on both sides of the nose.</p><p>Many people who have nasal polyps also have &quot;chronic sinusitis,&quot; a condition that can cause a stuffy nose, pain in the face, and discharge (mucus) from the nose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64506\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64506 \">figure 2</a>). Doctors do not know why some people get nasal polyps.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90701836\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of nasal polyps?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small polyps often do not cause any symptoms. Large polyps or having more than one polyp can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stuffiness or a blocked feeling in the nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feelings of pressure or fullness in the face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble smelling</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90701851\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will probably be able to tell if you have nasal polyps by doing an exam. He or she will probably look into your nose with a special tool that has a light on it. He or she might also suggest that you have a CT scan. A CT scan is an imaging test that takes a picture of the inside of your nose and sinuses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90701866\"><span class=\"h1\">How are nasal polyps treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal polyps are usually treated with medicines called steroids that come in pills or as a nose spray. Steroids used for nasal polyps are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These steroids can help shrink the polyps and make it easier to breathe. Steroid pills should only be used for short periods of time, no more than a few weeks a year. That's because they can have side effects if taken for longer.</p><p>If steroid medicines don't shrink your polyps, your doctor might suggest surgery. But in most people, polyps tend to come back after surgery if nothing more is done. So even if you have surgery, you must also keep using steroids, usually in the form of nose sprays or nose drops. Steroid sprays and drops can be used for longer than pills, because the dose is much lower.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90701881\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some people feel better if they rinse their nose and sinuses with salt water a few times a day. Ask your doctor or nurse if this would help in your case. If so, he or she can tell you the best way to do this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90701896\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinusitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sinusitis in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic rhinosinusitis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
