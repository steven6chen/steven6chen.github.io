There are also acquired forms of VWD that are caused by several different pathophysiologic mechanisms.</p><p>The classification and pathophysiology of VWD will be reviewed here. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of inherited VWD and acquired von Willebrand syndrome (aVWS) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired von Willebrand syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1926, Erik von Willebrand described the first patient with the disease that now bears his name. The patient and her family members, many of whom were also affected, lived on the &Aring;land Islands in the Gulf of Bothnia (in the Baltic Sea, between Finland and Sweden). The proband was severely affected and had multiple episodes of mucosal bleeding that led to her death at the age of 13 years; 4 of her 11 siblings were also severely affected. The patients' platelet counts were normal.</p><p>Von Willebrand named the disorder &quot;hereditary pseudohemophilia&quot; because he recognized the autosomal inheritance pattern in his study of 66 other family members (in contrast to the sex-linked recessive pattern seen in the hemophilias) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. After an assay for factor VIII became available in the 1950s, it was demonstrated that patients with VWD had decreased plasma levels of factor VIII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and that the bleeding could be corrected with transfusion of plasma or partially purified preparations of &quot;factor VIII&quot; (using preparations that we now know also contained VWF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Considerable debate remained about the nature of the protein(s), and there was uncertainty as to whether one or two proteins carried out the platelet-related functions and the factor VIII procoagulant functions. These concerns were resolved when factor VIII and VWF were cloned in the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. These observations, followed by improved understanding of the molecular genetics of VWF and VWD, led to the current classification of the different types of VWD. Despite new information, only minor additions have provided new information about the types of VWD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY OF VON WILLEBRAND FACTOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Von Willebrand factor (VWF) plays an important role in primary hemostasis by binding to both platelets and endothelial components, forming an adhesive bridge between platelets and vascular subendothelial structures and between adjacent platelets at sites of endothelial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. It also contributes to fibrin clot formation by acting as a carrier protein for factor VIII, which has a greatly shortened half-life and abnormally low concentration unless it is bound to VWF.</p><p>Von Willebrand factor circulates as a series of multimers formed from a basic dimer subunit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;</a>.) </p><p>High molecular weight VWF multimers are the most active forms of VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], providing multiple binding sites that can interact with both platelet receptors and subendothelial structures at sites of injury. Plasma VWF is synthesized by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes and undergoes extensive post-synthetic processing. When released actively from these cells, VWF contains even larger multimers than are normally observed in the circulation. Because these &quot;unusually large&quot; forms are prothrombotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], they are rapidly cleaved by a circulating protease, ADAMTS13, to the &quot;normal&quot; multimer size distribution as defined by a normal plasma pool. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The physiologic importance of the concentration and size distribution of VWF multimers is illustrated by the bleeding tendency that can occur in patients with VWD and by the thrombotic episodes that occur in individuals with high levels of VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The decrease in VWF levels in patients with VWD has been shown to confer a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affecting up to 1 percent of the population as assessed by random laboratory screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, only a fraction of patients come to medical attention because of bleeding symptoms and are diagnosed as having VWD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MUTATIONS IN VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inherited VWD has been classified into three types based on phenotypic, laboratory, and genetic information (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71525 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1, an autosomal dominant disease, is the most common, accounting for approximately 75 percent of patients. It represents a partial quantitative deficiency of VWF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2, which is usually an autosomal dominant disease, is characterized by several qualitative abnormalities of VWF. Four subtypes have been identified: 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 3, a total deficiency of VWF, is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to severe disease with undetectable levels of VWF.</p><p/><p>A database of <em>VWF</em> mutations has been established by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis and is maintained by the University of Sheffield, UK. This database is available on its website at <a href=\"http://www.ragtimedesign.com/vwf/mutation&amp;token=J67mqq32Ip+qzQwUMHqatHn1cHmVZNIAVJX43j+48o1eWCCddEaAhBuokXWH8PudygA3oVP23iOSwPrp1HvlrQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=1309\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.ragtimedesign.com/vwf/mutation</a>. Some of the specific mutations that result in VWD, mostly type 2 VWD, have been identified in areas of the gene that code for the known functional domains and would be expected to interfere with a particular function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60152 \">figure 1</a>). Mutations causing type 3 VWD, most frequently null alleles, have been identified throughout the VWF coding sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In type 1 VWD, the mutations are also diverse, located across the entire gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>The <em>VWF</em> gene is highly polymorphic, and a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms have been found that contribute to the large variation in &quot;normal&quot; VWF levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Polymorphisms in other (non-VWF) genes are also important. The largest non-pathogenetic contribution to the variation in VWF levels is due to the ABO blood group determinants (VWF and ABO blood groups share similar carbohydrate structure); they account for approximately 25 percent of the variance in VWF levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The following discussion will describe the genetics and pathophysiology of the different types of inherited VWD. Some specific mutations are noted as examples, and more can be found in the database noted above. It has become apparent that some single mutations can lead to more than one deficit in an individual patient; in general terms, the deficits include problems with subunit or multimer formation, storage, secretion, proteolysis, and increased clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The laboratory test abnormalities that these genetic defects produce and how they can be used to establish the diagnosis of VWD are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide spectrum of mutations, mostly missense, has been described in adults and children with type 1 VWD, all of which cause a partial deficiency of VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/20,25-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25-31</a>]. Although large studies have revealed mutations within the <em>VWF</em> gene associated with type 1 VWD in about two-thirds of patients, there is no generally available genetic screening test for this common disease because of the large number of different mutations that are spread throughout the gene. If one examines type 1 VWD patients who are diagnosed with stringent criteria (ie, VWF level &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/dL),</span> the percentage of mutations identified in the group rises significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. It is likely that yet more mutations remain unidentified. Additionally, investigations point to the importance of other, non-VWF, genes that influence VWF levels, such as those that determine ABO blood groups. Individuals with blood group O have lower levels of VWF, and blood type O has been shown to correlate with shortened VWF half-life. Additional non-VWF genetic loci such as those encoding <em>CLEC4M</em> and <em>STXBP5</em> contribute to the variability in VWF levels, likely related to the clearance and secretion of VWF, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. A site on chromosome 2 has also been shown to be associated with variations in the level of VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Increased clearance that leads to low levels of VWF has been described in a significant number of patients with type 1 VWD, particularly with the use of assays for the VWF propeptide (VWFpp) and application of the VWFpp:VWF:Ag ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/30,36-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,36-42</a>]. The VWFpp is a large peptide that is cleaved from VWF late in the course of intracellular synthesis and released in equimolar concentration with mature VWF; it circulates with a different half-life unrelated to the half-life of VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. If VWF is cleared rapidly, the VWFpp:VWF:Ag ratio increases, and a ratio of &gt;3 has been used to designate &quot;rapid clearance&quot; of VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The group of type 1 patients that has rapid clearance of VWF has been designated as type 1C. Mutations for type 1C are found dispersed throughout the VWF gene, with higher frequencies in the N- and C-termini [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In addition, some patients with severe disease, type 3 VWD, have been shown to have extremely rapid clearance and have been reassigned as severe type 1 VWD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Mutations have been described in type 1 VWD that interfere with intracellular transport of VWF dimers, resulting in intracellular retention of the mutant VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/28,45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,45-48</a>]. Some of these mutations affect cysteine residues and may modify disulfide bond formation, causing inhibition of VWF multimer assembly and retention of mutant VWF due to defective pairing of the mutant subunit with normal or abnormal monomer. One study identified a Tyr1584Cys variation in 10 of 70 Canadian families with type 1 VWD, which indicates a founder effect and appears to result in increased cellular retention of the VWF protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Mutations affecting transcription can cause VWD; a patient with a deletion that alters the binding of transcription factors to the VWF promoter and reduces VWF expression has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Mutations causing allele specific degradation of mRNA have also been described in several patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>A heterozygous deletion of exons 4 and 5 leads to type 1 VWD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A relatively small quantity of the abnormal VWF protein is found intracellularly, which appears to be enough to cause a decrease in the secretion of normal VWF from the unaffected allele, a so-called dominant negative mechanism. This deletion can be missed during genetic screening studies, as it is masked by the remaining normal allele. The same mutation, in the homozygous state or in combination with a second VWF mutation, can cause type 3 VWD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical variability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of type 1 VWD varies from mild to severe as determined by bleeding symptoms. However, some patients with type 1 disease are asymptomatic and have been discovered incidentally in studies investigating a relative with type 3 disease. Thus, inheritance of a single mutant allele is not always associated with bleeding. A possible explanation for this variability is that the presence or absence of bleeding within type 1 families may be due to an interaction with gene haplotypes affecting reduced expression or activity of specific platelet collagen adhesion receptors (eg, subunits alpha(2), alpha(IIb,) and GPVI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].

Affected patients generally present with moderate to moderately severe bleeding. A decrease in high molecular weight multimers of VWF is seen in laboratory assays.</p><p>Many of the mutations are located in the region of the <em>VWF</em> gene encoding the A2 domain and affect the ADAMTS13 cleavage site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60152 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Additional mutations are located in the CK or in the D2 and D3 regions and alter the synthesis of dimers and multimers, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/55-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-64</a>]. Mutations causing intracellular retention may also cause type 2A VWD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Further studies suggest that some mutations may result in a complex of mechanisms that includes more than one of the processes mentioned above and that often demonstrates a negative effect in the processing of normal VWF in co-expression studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Recessive forms of type 2A are caused by mutations within the propeptide, resulting in impaired multimer formation (previously called type 2C VWD), and by an A2801D mutation, which prevents dimerization of VWF subunits (previously called type 2D VWD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 2B and type 2M</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Missense mutations causing either an increase (type 2B) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/54,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,70,71</a>] or a decrease (type 2M) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>] in the binding of VWF to platelet GP Ib have been identified in the region of the <em>VWF</em> gene encoding the A1 domain (the GP Ib binding site) of VWF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60152 \">figure 1</a>).

These mutations appear to disrupt the structure within the A1 domain that contains the binding site for platelet GP Ib alpha, and result in a VWF that binds more readily to GP Ib alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]; thus it represents a &quot;gain-of-function&quot; mutation.

Patients previously diagnosed as having the Montreal platelet syndrome, characterized by moderately severe thrombocytopenia, mucocutaneous bleeding, giant platelets, and spontaneous in vitro platelet aggregation, have been shown to have type 2B VWD with the previously reported V1316M mutation involving exon 28 of the VWF gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/78,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,80</a>].

In comparison to other forms of VWD, the platelet-related functions of VWF are not affected and VWF antigen, ristocetin cofactor, and multimer patterns are normal. The net effect is that patients present with the type of bleeding associated with factor VIII deficiency such as soft tissue, joint, and urinary bleeding and bleeding after invasive procedures, rather than the moderate to severe mucocutaneous bleeding seen in the other forms of VWD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Due to the type of bleeding symptoms and the normal VWF laboratory findings, some patients with type 2N VWD are misdiagnosed as having hemophilia A. Type 2N VWD should be suspected in females who present with isolated factor VIII deficiency (with normal levels of VWF) and in families in which an autosomal (rather than X-linked) inheritance pattern for factor VIII deficiency is suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>].</p><p>In order to be symptomatic, type 2N mutations must be inherited in a homozygous manner, or occur in patients with a second <em>VWF</em> defect causing decreased synthesis of the second allele, or be combined with a hemophilia A carrier status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/91,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,94</a>].

It is a homozygous or compound heterozygous disorder that can result from different genetic defects including nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations, partial or complete deletions (the most common mutations in type 3 VWD), and nondeletion defects resulting in loss of VWF mRNA expression or impaired secretion and intracellular retention (for specific mutations refer to database noted above) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60152\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60152 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/19,96-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,96-100</a>].

VWF plays an important role in primary hemostasis by binding to both platelets and endothelial components, forming an adhesive bridge between platelets and vascular subendothelial structures and between adjacent platelets at sites of endothelial injury. High molecular weight VWF multimers are the most active forms of VWF, providing multiple binding sites that can interact with both platelet receptors and subendothelial structures at sites of injury. VWF also contributes to fibrin clot formation by acting as a carrier protein for factor VIII, which has a greatly shortened half-life and abnormally low concentration unless it is bound to VWF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Physiology of von Willebrand factor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, affecting up to 1 percent of the population as assessed by random laboratory screening. The types and subtypes of VWD are classified according to their effects on VWF levels and protein function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71525 \">table 1</a>).

It represents a partial quantitative deficiency of VWF. Mutations causing type 1 VWD are distributed throughout the <em>VWF</em> gene. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Type 1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 2 VWD, which is usually an autosomal dominant disease, is characterized by several qualitative abnormalities of VWF (ie, effects on protein function). Four subtypes are identified: 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N. Many mutations, which often affect protein domains containing sites that mediate specific VWF functions, have been identified. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Type 2A'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Type 2B and type 2M'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Type 2N'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 3 VWD, essentially a total deficiency of VWF, is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to pronounced bleeding symptoms with undetectable levels of VWF and low levels of factor VIII.
