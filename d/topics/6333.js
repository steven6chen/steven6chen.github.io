Early consultation of specialists skilled in securing tenuous airways (eg, anesthesiologist, intensivist, and otolaryngologist), even if proven ultimately to have been unnecessary, is preferable to an alternative approach where the patient is observed for signs of deterioration before such consultation, which may not provide sufficient time to control the airway. </p><p>If available, a designated critical airway team with specialized airway skills and equipment should be activated immediately when a patient is presumptively diagnosed with epiglottitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2236434089\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient not able to maintain airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with signs of total or near-total airway obstruction due to epiglottitis, airway control precedes diagnostic evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F112297\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112297 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523753319\"><span class=\"h3\">Bag-valve-mask ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If not already performed, the physician should immediately call upon available subspecialists with the skills needed to manage a critical airway and first proceed with bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation with 100 percent oxygen and meticulous attention to technique, including mask size and seal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76143\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76143 \">picture 4</a>), patient positioning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69636\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69636 \">picture 5</a>), and tidal volume (volume just large enough to cause chest rise) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80091\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80091 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72516\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72516 \">picture 7</a>).

The laryngoscope is used to directly elevate the epiglottis to expose the glottic aperture. Indirect lifting methods, such as tensing the hyoepiglottic ligament by placing the laryngoscope in the vallecula, should <strong>not</strong> be used, regardless of the shape or type of blade. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H18429782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscope'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=video-laryngoscopes-and-optical-stylets-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults#H4089324158\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Video laryngoscopes and optical stylets for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscopy technique'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with epiglottis, particularly for pediatric patients in whom surgical airway management is much more difficult , this approach permits a single attempt at intubation using the maximal level of technology available (eg, video laryngoscope) prior to initiating surgical airway management, as long as preparations for a surgical airway occur in parallel with the attempt. </p><p>If the first effort to intubate is unsuccessful but was attempted without use of the best equipment available in the center, a second effort with such equipment, prior to establishing a surgical airway, may be attempted if time allows. The principle is to avoid the time that may lapse with multiple unsuccessful attempts at intubation before proceeding to surgical airway management in a persistently hypoxic child. </p><p>Of note, when attempted by persons with experience in airway management in children, endotracheal intubation is almost always successful in children with epiglottitis. Although the supraglottic airway is narrowed by the swollen epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds in epiglottitis, the laryngeal introitus (lumen) is typically spared but difficult to see due to the supra-glottic swelling. </p><p>While preparation for establishing a surgical airway as immediate back-up plan for these children is always prudent, surgical airway management will rarely be necessary in centers in which advanced pediatric airway management expertise exists.</p><p>Do <strong>not</strong> attempt placement of a supraglottic airway device (eg, laryngeal mask airway) because these devices are <strong>not</strong> effective in patients with acute upper airway obstruction or distorted airway anatomy.

Otherwise healthy children who are nontoxic, have been immunized against <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b, have a normal airway, and have &lt;50 percent of airway obstruction by direct visualization are candidates for intensive care unit observation <strong>without</strong> endotracheal intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adults without severe respiratory distress and with &lt;50 percent obstruction of the laryngeal lumen can be initially monitored closely in an intensive care unit setting without placement of an artificial airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whenever possible, a blood culture and, in intubated patients, an epiglottic culture should be obtained prior to antibiotic administration. We suggest that patients with epiglottitis receive combination therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a>) AND an antistaphylococcal agent active against MRSA (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> or as determined by the local prevalence and sensitivities of MRSA isolates) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60306\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60306 \">table 4</a>) for 7 to 10 days, depending upon patient response (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Once culture and susceptibility results are available, the regimen should be adjusted to provide optimal coverage of the isolated organism. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with epiglottitis should be monitored in an intensive care unit. Children should be cared for in a pediatric intensive care unit. Daily examination of the supraglottis is necessary to assess the response to therapy, look for complications (eg, epiglottic abscess), and monitor for delayed airway obstruction (in patients managed without an artificial airway). Patients who are intubated during treatment for epiglottitis require meticulous respiratory nursing care and suctioning. Inadvertent extubation must be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Ongoing care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Criteria for elective extubation include resolution of <span class=\"nowrap\">epiglottic/supraglottic</span> swelling, as indicated by laryngoscopy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an air leak around the endotracheal tube, resolution of fever, and ability to swallow comfortably. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Ongoing care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epiglottic swelling is generally improved after two to three days of antimicrobial therapy for epiglottitis caused by <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib). A more protracted course may be more common with etiologies other than Hib (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54481 \">table 5</a>). Persistence of epiglottic swelling beyond 72 hours should be evaluated on a case by case basis, with the following causes in mind (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Ongoing care'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A potentially ineffective antimicrobial regimen </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Development of an epiglottic abscess or other complication </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A more indolent clinical course consistent with the causative microbe (eg, <em>S. pyogenes</em>)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epiglottitis-supraglottitis-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rafei K, Lichenstein R.
