The medical term for this is a &quot;ruptured aneurysm.&quot;</p><p>A subarachnoid hemorrhage is life threatening, especially when it is caused by a ruptured aneurysm. Many people who have a subarachnoid hemorrhage die from it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19129045\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is a sudden and very painful headache. It can feel like the worst headache you ever had. </p><p>Other symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting (passing out)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a seizure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being bothered by bright light</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low back pain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19129060\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for subarachnoid hemorrhage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor suspects you have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage, he or she can order 1 or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan of your head &ndash; This test uses a type of X-ray to take pictures of the inside of your head. If there is bleeding around your brain, a CT scan will likely show it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; During this procedure, a doctor puts a needle into your lower back and takes out a small sample of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. If this fluid has more red blood cells than usual, you could have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This test is done if the CT scan does not show bleeding but your doctor still thinks you might have a subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other imaging tests &ndash; If the CT scan or lumbar puncture shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage, your doctor might do other tests to see if the cause is a ruptured aneurysm. These tests include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CT angiography (often called &quot;CTA&quot;) or magnetic resonance angiography (often called &quot;MRA&quot;) &ndash; These tests use special types of CT and MRI scans to create pictures of the blood vessels in the brain. Doctors use a dye injection in CTA, and sometimes in MRA. The dye is a chemical that makes blood vessels show up more clearly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Catheter angiography &ndash; For this test, the doctor puts a thin tube into a large artery in your leg. Then the doctor moves the tube into the large blood vessels that carry blood to your head. Next the doctor injects a dye into the tube that shows up on an X-ray. The dye can show problems with the blood vessels in the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19129075\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a subarachnoid hemorrhage treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people who have a subarachnoid hemorrhage go to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital for treatment. In the hospital, the doctor might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give medicines and other treatments to reduce the brain damage caused by the bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give medicines to lower blood pressure if it is too high</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop medicines that thin the blood, such as aspirin or warfarin (brand names: Coumadin, Jantoven). If you take blood-thinning medicines, your doctor might give you treatments to help your blood clot. This can help stop bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do tests to figure out the cause of the bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watch the pressure in the brain to make sure it does not get too high</p><p/><p>If an aneurysm caused the subarachnoid hemorrhage, doctors must do surgery or another procedure to keep the bleeding from happening again. Depending on the size and location of the aneurysm, they might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do surgery to put a small clip on the aneurysm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put tiny coils in the aneurysm. (This is done during a catheter angiography procedure.)</p><p/><p>After a subarachnoid hemorrhage, most people stay in the ICU for a few days, weeks, or sometimes longer. Doctors and nurses watch for problems such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irregular heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots in the legs </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolytes out of balance &ndash; Electrolytes are chemicals in the body that must be present in the right amounts for your body to work correctly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasospasm &ndash; This is a medical term meaning that the arteries in the brain spasm, causing them to suddenly get narrower. This can happen in the first few days and weeks after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It can lead to a stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19129090\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A subarachnoid hemorrhage is very serious. Many people die from this type of stroke. Many people who survive &ndash; but not all &ndash; have long-lasting health problems afterwards.</p><p>People who have severe subarachnoid hemorrhages can have certain health problems later, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood changes or problems with emotions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinking problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble speaking, walking, or doing other activities</p><p/><p>For some people, these problems can be disabling. For others, they might not exist or cause only mild problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19129107\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brain-aneurysm-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brain aneurysm (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
