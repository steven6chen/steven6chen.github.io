Shelf-life extenders include preservatives, antioxidants, and <span class=\"nowrap\">curing/pickling</span> agents. Thickeners, colors, gelling agents, and non-nutritive sweeteners are added to alter the sensory characteristics of foods. Food additives are identified in the United States by their English names or in the European Union, by a unique identifying number, the &quot;E number&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-and-asthmatic-reactions-to-food-additives/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213672\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients and parents of young children suspect allergy and intolerance to food additives far more often than it can be verified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-and-asthmatic-reactions-to-food-additives/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Many of the cases of adverse reactions attributed to food additives that are reported in the medical literature are either anecdotal or characterized by poorly-controlled challenge procedures.

CU is inherently variable, and when the disorder first develops, many patients will try to make an association with specific foods or food additives. However, clinically relevant allergies to foods or food additives are rare in patients with CU. Clinicians should not routinely advise patients with CU to avoid food additives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-and-asthmatic-reactions-to-food-additives/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Although allergies rarely cause this disorder, a subset of patients with CU will notice that symptoms are exacerbated (not caused) by foods that have high levels of natural histamine-like chemicals. The relationship between diet and symptom severity in CU is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Standard management and patient education&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most accurate means to assess a possible adverse reaction is to utilize double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge protocols, as is done with food challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-and-asthmatic-reactions-to-food-additives/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, challenges are particularly difficult to perform in patients with CU, because, on one hand, withdrawal of antihistamines can result in increased symptoms that can be misinterpreted as a positive challenge. On the other hand, the patient is unlikely to react to challenge if full doses of antihistamine are continued, yielding false-negative results.</p><p>In a study of 100 patients with CU evaluated at the author's center over a 10-year period, subjects were challenged with 11 common food and drug additives. Forty-three percent of the group reported suspected reactions to additives. Prior to challenge, antihistamines were tapered to the &quot;minimal effective dose&quot; that allowed patients to be comfortable, but not hive-free. Subjects were than given a single-blind challenge consisting of multiple opaque capsules containing the following additives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-and-asthmatic-reactions-to-food-additives/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monosodium glutamate (MSG)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-benzoate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Sodium benzoate</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methyl paraben</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tartrazine (FD&amp;C Yellow #5, E102)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunset yellow (FD&amp;C Yellow #6, E110)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sodium nitrate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-nitrite-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium nitrite</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspartame</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium metabisulfite</p><p/><p>Criteria for a positive challenge used &quot;skin scores&quot; of urticarial lesions. Skin scores for several hours after the challenge were compared with scores from the previous three days.

After two weeks, these two patients underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled challenges with each additive separately on 11 different days. Neither patient reacted to any additives. Thus, none of the 100 patients was sensitive to any of the additives tested, suggesting that reactivity to food additives in patients with CU is rare, if it occurs at all.

Sulfites are also used as sanitizers and to inhibit the growth of undesirable micro-organisms in the fermentation industry. Sulfiting agents include sulfur dioxide, sodium potassium sulfite, bisulfite, and metabisulfite. Foods containing sulfites are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66943\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66943 \">table 3</a>). The highest levels of sulfites are found in commercially prepared dried fruits (such as apricots), potatoes, wines, and some seafood items [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-and-asthmatic-reactions-to-food-additives/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Sulfiting agents can cause serious and potentially life-threatening asthmatic reactions in patients with asthma, as demonstrated in double-blind controlled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-and-asthmatic-reactions-to-food-additives/abstract/22,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23,25</a>].

It was reported to provoke bronchospasm in patients with asthma, although the studies that supported this conclusion in the 1960s and 1970s lacked adequate controls by modern standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-and-asthmatic-reactions-to-food-additives/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. It was also believed by some clinicians at the time that tartrazine &quot;cross-reacts&quot; with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and should be avoided by patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). However, tartrazine is not a cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibitor like NSAIDs, and subsequent studies have shown it is well-tolerated in patients with AERD.

These diets are sometimes proposed as an initial means of determining that the patient is sensitive to some additive, without implicating a specific one. As an example, patients may be advised to eat a limited number of specified meats, grains, fruits, and vegetables for three weeks, and if the symptoms improve, then it is concluded that the patient is allergic to some additive. However, this approach has several drawbacks. Patients' symptoms often improve initially, but then gradual reintroduction of commercially prepared foods does not lead to identification of a specific culprit. Sometimes patients remain well for a while despite resuming a normal diet, and then their symptoms eventually return and begin to wax and wane again. In addition, it is difficult to adhere to an additive-free diet for any significant period of time, so most people cannot maintain the exercise for very long.</p><p>For patients who experienced anaphylaxis and who normally eat commercially prepared or processed foods, additive-free diets are difficult to maintain over time, and the patient is likely to resume <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> prior eating habits over time.

These &quot;natural&quot; additives are derived from plants, insects, or animals, and the reactions are believed to be immunoglobulin (IgE)-mediated.

Testing and challenge procedures should be done by an allergy expert, since these techniques require training and experience to interpret correctly and have the potential to cause allergic reactions in very sensitive patients. (See <a href=\"#H1752493\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any patient who has experienced anaphylaxis should be supplied with an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector. If the history suggests that a food additive may have been responsible, the patient should be referred to an allergy specialist with experience in performing testing and challenges to food additives.
