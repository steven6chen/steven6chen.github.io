Abnormalities in the oral cavity can affect the systemic health, growth, and development of children. Likewise, systemic conditions or their treatments can affect the oral cavity or the feasibility of delivering dental care.</p><p>The oral conditions that affect systemic health and the systemic conditions that affect oral health <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the delivery of dental treatment are reviewed here. The oral manifestations of systemic, genetic, or infectious disease are described in the topic reviews for those conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ORAL CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SYSTEMIC HEALTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oral cavity plays an important role in nutrition, speech, and facial appearance. Each of these functions may be affected by abnormalities in the oral cavity.</p><p>Children with cleft lip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palate (CLP), for example, have difficulty feeding, require speech therapy, and are at increased risk for otitis media. In addition, they are at risk for long-term psychosocial effects. A systematic review found an association between CLP and behavioral problems, dissatisfaction with facial appearance, depression, and anxiety, but the evidence was inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a subsequent case-control study, children and young adults with CLP had more behavioral problems, more depressive symptoms, were teased more often, and were less happy with their facial appearance and speech than children and young adults without CLP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160;Dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease and its effects reach far beyond the oral cavity. Moderate or severe caries, particularly in young children, may affect nutrition and growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment of dental caries may contribute to inability to concentrate or poor performance at school and school absences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The cost of treating children with dental problems in emergency rooms and hospitals is high. In 2007, two deaths of children were attributed to systemic infections secondary to dental abscesses or their treatment. Several children die each year from treatment-related problems in dental offices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Controversial associations between oral and systemic health</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the psychosocial, speech, nutritional, and educational effects of oral disease are some controversial or less well-established associations between oral and systemic health. Pediatric health care providers should be aware of these associations and the evidence, or lack of evidence, to support them so they may advise their patients accordingly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72405\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72405 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental lead exposure is associated with an increased prevalence of dental caries in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Data from animal studies support this association and provide a possible mechanism. Pre- and perinatal exposure to lead in rat pups results in decreased stimulated parotid function and increased prevalence of caries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondhand smoke exposure increases the risk for dental caries, with multiple mechanisms proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal periodontal disease has been linked with preterm delivery and low-birthweight infants in case-control studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. &#160;However, a systematic review of randomized trials concluded that periodontal treatment during pregnancy may reduce low birth weight, but it is not clear that it reduces preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nonetheless, the maintenance of maternal oral health is important because <em>Streptococcus mutans</em>, an important etiologic agent in dental caries, is transmitted from mothers to infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodontal disease was associated with coronary heart disease in one cohort study of 1147 veterans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Its etiology is unclear. Molar incisor hypomineralization has been linked to early childhood illnesses, including fever, asthma, and pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-and-systemic-health/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The main complication of periodontal disease is tooth loss. However, bone loss and local and systemic spread of infection can occur, leading to periodontal abscess and orofacial &quot;space&quot; infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
