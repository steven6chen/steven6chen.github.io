The risk of developing CRC is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. The epidemiology of CRC and risk factors for its development will be discussed here. Colorectal screening, clinical presentation, prognostic determinants, and treatment of colon and rectal cancer are discussed elsewhere.

Globally, CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females, with 1.65 million new cases and almost 835,000 deaths in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rates are substantially higher in males than in females. Global, country-specific incidence and mortality rates are available in the World Health Organization <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/Map.aspx&amp;token=0fC2KlWP2lBbCApZ6DyKw47MnQXaSNBIvsugca7gMSw+6djwprsRosUIl828CRp5&amp;TOPIC_ID=2606\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">GLOBOCAN database</a>.</p><p>In the United States, both the incidence and mortality have been slowly but steadily decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Annually, approximately 140,250 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed, of which 97,220 are colon and the remainder are rectal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Annually, approximately 50,630 Americans die of CRC, accounting for approximately 8 percent of all cancer deaths.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Globally, the incidence of CRC varies over 10-fold. The highest incidence rates are in Australia and New Zealand, Europe, and North America, and the lowest rates are found in Africa and South-Central Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These geographic differences appear to be attributable to differences in dietary and environmental exposures that are imposed upon a background of genetically determined susceptibility.</p><p>Low socioeconomic status (SES) is also associated with an increased risk for the development of CRC; one study estimated the CRC risk to be about 30 percent increased in the lowest as compared with the highest SES quintile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Potentially modifiable behaviors such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking, and obesity are thought to account for a substantial proportion (estimates of one-third to one-half) of the socioeconomic disparity in risk of new-onset CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Other factors, particularly lower rates of CRC screening, also contribute substantively to SES differences in CRC risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In the United States, CRC incidence rates have declined about 2.5 to 4 percent per year over the last 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Incidence rates in most other western countries have been stable or increased slightly during this period. In contrast, CRC incidence rates have rapidly increased in several areas historically at low risk, including Spain, and a number of countries within Eastern Asia and Eastern Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Age is a major risk factor for sporadic CRC. Large bowel cancer is uncommon before the age of 40; the incidence begins to increase significantly between the ages of 40 and 50, and age-specific incidence rates increase in each succeeding decade thereafter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111996 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>More recent data from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Reporting (SEER) database and other Western cancer registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] suggest that CRC incidence is increasing in the under age 50 group while it is decreasing in older groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. In the United States, the incidence of CRC in men and women under the age of 50 steadily increased at a rate of 2 percent per year from 1992 through 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Some registries report a rising incidence of CRC even among young adults 20 to 39 years of age, although the absolute incidence in this age group remains far lower than for adults aged 50 or over [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>These increases are driven predominantly by left-sided cancers in general and rectal cancer in particular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Current literature suggests that over 86 percent of those diagnosed under the age of 50 are symptomatic at diagnosis, and this is associated with more advanced stage at diagnosis and poorer outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. At present, screening is not recommended for individuals under the age of 50 unless they have a positive family history or a predisposing inherited syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-colorectal-cancer-strategies-in-patients-at-average-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-colorectal-cancer-in-patients-with-a-family-history-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, in the United States, it is estimated that 35 percent of these young adult cancers are associated with the known hereditary CRC syndromes, and the cause(s) for these increases remain unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,19</a>]. Interestingly, these trends have also been observed in developing countries, including &quot;low-resource&quot; countries traditionally thought of as having low rates of CRC compared to Western countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Literature suggests that ratios of early to late onset CRC in multiple low-resource countries are strikingly higher than the international average in general and in the West in particular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Current efforts to reduce young adult CRC incidence and mortality are focused on identifying those eligible for earlier age surveillance, based on family history, and promoting both physician and consumer awareness of the potential cancer risk of symptoms, such as persistent rectal bleeding at any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, the lifetime incidence of CRC in patients at average risk is about 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. CRC incidence is about 25 percent higher in men than in women and is about 20 percent higher in African Americans than in whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The incidence is higher in patients with specific inherited conditions that predispose them to the development of CRC. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>A gradual shift toward right-sided or proximal colon cancers has been observed both in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] and internationally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] with the greatest relative increase in incidence in cecal primaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. This change in the anatomic distribution of CRCs may be, in part, related to improvements in diagnosis and treatment, and increased screening with removal of adenomatous polyps in the distal colon. Colonoscopy is more effective in preventing left-sided than right-sided CRCs, which could also contribute to a shift in distribution of cancers in the colon. It is likely that part of the difference is due to aspects of quality relating to the colonoscopy (poor right-sided preps, incomplete colonoscopy, anatomic configurations compromising visibility) but the biology may also differ between CRCs of the right and left colon. For example, serrated adenomas, which are flatter and more difficult to visualize endoscopically, and which characteristically carry BRAF V600E mutations and give rise to microsatellite unstable CRCs, are more common in the right colon. Although all of these issues may contribute to a shift toward right- rather than left-sided cancers, there also appears to be a true increase in the incidence of ascending colon and cecal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/27,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30</a>].

This improvement in outcome can be attributed, at least in part, to detection and removal of colonic polyps, detection of CRCs at an earlier stage, and more effective primary and adjuvant treatments. However, at least in the United States, the decline in CRC mortality started well before the widespread implementation of CRC screening and before effective adjuvant therapy became widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

In data derived from the SEER Database of the National Cancer Institute, CRC mortality rates per 100,000 population among individuals aged 20 to 54 declined from 6.3 in 1970 to 3.9 in 2004, and then increased by 1 percent annually to 4.3 in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The increase was limited to White individuals (1.4 percent annual increase in mortality between 2004 and 2014). In contrast, among Black individuals and other races, mortality rates were either stable or declined slightly during this time period.</p><p>Globally, the United States has one of the highest survival rates from CRC. Data collected by the SEER Program of the United States National Cancer Institute suggest that 61 percent of all patients treated for CRC (all stages and sites combined) survive five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In contrast to these data, mortality rates continue to increase in many countries with more limited resources and health infrastructure, particularly in Central and South America and Eastern Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some data support the view that some risk factors are more related to colon rather than to rectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], we will consider both entities together.</p><p>Environmental and genetic factors can increase the likelihood of developing CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although inherited susceptibility results in the most striking increases in risk, the majority of CRCs are sporadic rather than familial. These risk factors can be separated into those that confer a sufficiently high risk to alter recommendations for CRC screening, factors that may alter screening recommendations, and those that do not alter screening recommendations because they are thought to confer a small or uncertain magnitude of risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90629946\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors that currently influence screening recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRC screening recommendations are modified for members of families with hereditary colon cancer syndromes, on the basis of personal or family history of CRC or adenomas in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and in those who have been exposed to abdominal radiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90629953\"><span class=\"h3\">Hereditary CRC syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CRC (both sporadic and inherited) is evolving rapidly.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]) are the most common of the familial colon cancer syndromes, but together these two conditions account for only about 5 percent of CRC cases, the majority of which are Lynch syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].

In this analysis of 1058 individuals with CRC attending a tertiary American Cancer Center, 105 patients had one or more pathogenic mutations. Seventy-four (7 percent of the total) carried non-Lynch syndrome mutations, which included mutations in high-penetrance genes (<em>APC</em>, biallelic <em>MUTYH</em>, <em>BRCA1 and 2</em>, <em>PALB2</em>, <em>CDKN2A</em>, and <em>TP53</em>), as well as moderate-penetrance genes (monoallelic <em>MUTYH </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], <em>APC </em>allele<em> </em>p.I1307K [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], <em>CHEK2</em>) for which the risk of CRC is not well defined. &#160;</p><p>An even higher proportion (16 percent) of early-onset CRCs (ie, diagnosed prior to age 50) may be associated with an inherited syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Furthermore, one-third of those found to have a potentially pathogenic germline mutation did not meet established genetic testing criteria for the gene in which they had a mutation. These data suggest that genetic counseling and testing with a multigene panel could be considered for all patients with early-onset CRC. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Adenomatous polyposis syndromes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1638683537\"><span class=\"h5\">FAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and its variants (Gardner syndrome, Turcot syndrome, and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis [AFAP]) account for less than 1 percent of CRCs. In typical FAP, numerous colonic adenomas appear during childhood. Symptoms appear at an average age of approximately 16 years and colonic cancer occurs in 90 percent of untreated individuals by age 45 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59413\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59413 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73267\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73267 \">picture 2</a>). AFAP carries a high risk of colon cancer (though its magnitude is not as well defined), but is characterized by fewer adenomas and an older average age of cancer diagnosis of 54 years.

The same gene is involved in the attenuated form of FAP, but the sites of the <em>APC</em> gene mutations are different.

The phenotype of MAP is variable, but it can present with a polyposis phenotype; typically with fewer than 500 adenomas. The base excision repair system repairs mutations due to oxidative DNA damage, and the <em>APC</em> gene appears to be particularly susceptible to such damage. Thus, failure of the base excision repair system often leads to somatic mutations in <em>APC</em>, especially G:C to T:A transversions, which can lead to a polyposis phenotype. An increasing number of reports suggest that germline mutations in these <em>MUTYH</em> genes may account for a substantial fraction of familial CRCs that occur in the absence of a dominantly inherited familial syndrome, and that a significant number of biallelic carriers present with cancer without associated polyposis, making their phenotype very difficult to identify (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'MUTYH defects and familial CRC'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mutyh-associated-polyposis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;MUTYH-associated polyposis&quot;</a>).</p><p>New polyposis genes (<em>POLE</em> and <em>POLD1</em>, <em>MSH3</em>, and <em>NTHL</em>-associated polyposis [NAP]) are now part of next-generation panels with developing experience of their phenotypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Lynch syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lynch syndrome or HNPCC is an autosomal dominant syndrome that is more common than FAP and accounts for approximately 3 percent of all colonic adenocarcinomas. Lynch syndrome can be suspected on the basis of a strong family history of CRC, endometrial, and other cancers.

The term Lynch syndrome is now commonly reserved for families who have been genetically determined to have a disease-causing defect in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, most commonly <em>hMLH1</em>, <em>hMSH2</em>, <em>hMSH6</em>, or <em>hPMS2</em>. As a general rule, patients with Lynch syndrome have a germline mutation in one allele of a MMR gene, and the second allele is somatically inactivated in the CRCs by somatic mutation, loss of heterozygosity, or epigenetic silencing by promoter hypermethylation. As a result, Lynch syndrome CRCs have impaired DNA MMR, are hypermutable, and are microsatellite unstable.

The mean age at initial cancer diagnosis is about 48 years, with some patients presenting in their 20s. Nearly 70 percent of first lesions arise proximal to the splenic flexure, and approximately 10 percent will have synchronous (simultaneous onset of two or more distinct tumors) or metachronous cancers (non-anastomotic new tumors developing at least six months after the initial diagnosis). The chance of developing metachronous CRC in those who have had a segmental resection is high: in a study of 382 gene carriers, 16 percent at 10 years, rising to 62 percent at 30 years after primary resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Extracolonic cancers are very common in Lynch syndrome, particularly endometrial carcinoma, which may occur in up to 60 percent of female mutation carriers in some families. Other sites at increased risk of neoplasm formation include the ovary, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary system, brain and renal pelvis or ureter, and possibly breast and prostate.</p><p>Penetrance estimates for colon and endometrial cancer in carriers of <em>MLH1</em> or <em>MSH2</em> mutations were initially thought to be &gt;80 percent, and 40 percent, respectively. However, these early estimates were based on selected families referred for gene testing, which produced biased estimates (upwards). More recent estimates from population-based series suggest that penetrance estimates are about one-half of what they were initially thought to be, and indicates that at least for carriers of an <em>MSH6</em> or <em>MSH2</em> mutation the risk is highest in individuals aged 30 to 39, and that much of the risk attributed to this syndrome is over by the mid-fifties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Penetrance estimates for <em>MSH6</em> and <em>PMS2</em> carriers are even more modest, making identification of families with these genetic mutations more difficult to identify from family history interrogation. <em>MSH6</em> carriers have a predilection for endometrial cancers.

Twelve of 18 cohort studies and&nbsp;six of nine&nbsp;case control studies found an association for consumption of processed meat and CRC,&nbsp;while 7 of 14 cohort studies and&nbsp;7 of 15 case control studies found a positive association for red meat consumption and CRC.&nbsp;A meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies reported a statistically significant dose-response relationship between meat consumption and CRC risk with a 17 percent increased risk (95%CI 1.05-1.31) per 100 g per day of red meat, and an 18 percent increase in risk (95% CI 1.10-1.28) per 50 g per day of processed meat. Based upon the large amount of data and the consistent association of CRC with processed meats across studies in different populations, which make chance, bias and confounding unlikely as explanations, a majority of the working group concluded that there was sufficient evidence in human beings to classify processed meats (eg, sausages, bacon, ham, beef jerky, corned beef, and other smoked, salted, fermented, or cured meats) as group 1 carcinogens, placing these foods in the same risk category for cancer as asbestos, cigarettes, and alcohol (although the amount of increased risk is nowhere near the same)</p><p>Chance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with the same degree of confidence for the data on red meat consumption, since no clear association was seen in several high-quality studies, and residual confounding from other diet and lifestyle factors was difficult to exclude.

Regular use of aspirin and other NSAIDs is associated with a 20 to 40 percent reduction in the risk of colonic adenomas and CRC in individuals at average risk. Late follow-up reports of the British randomized controlled trials of aspirin, primarily addressing cardiovascular endpoints, reported similar reductions of 50 percent in CRC and other cancer incidences and death after a delayed (latent) period of at least five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors/abstract/217,218\" class=\"abstract_t\">217,218</a>].
