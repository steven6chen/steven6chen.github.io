Psychosocial interventions also help the patient to cope with depressive symptoms, improve social and self-management skills, and increase self-confidence.</p><p>Psychosocial treatments include, but are not limited to, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy for adolescents (IPT-A), family therapy, dynamic therapy, group therapy, and supportive therapy. Among these, only CBT and IPT-A have been shown to be efficacious in controlled research within a delineated population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The psychosocial interventions for the treatment of adolescent depression will be discussed below. An overview of treatment for adolescent depression and pharmacologic treatments for adolescent depression are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of prevention and treatment for pediatric depression&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-unipolar-depression-and-pharmacotherapy-choosing-a-medication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric unipolar depression and pharmacotherapy: Choosing a medication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Independent of the psychosocial treatment strategy employed, the following considerations are important for effective intervention:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once adolescent depression has been identified, psychosocial treatment begins with a systematic assessment of the different domains that will be targets for intervention (ie, cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and interpersonal) using multiple methods and informants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for comorbid disorders is critical; comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception for adolescents. Comorbid conditions often warrant adjunct psychosocial, educational, or medical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-unipolar-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric unipolar depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Comorbidity'</a> and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive psychotherapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although depression generally is conceptualized as an individual disorder, a multitude of interpersonal problems or maladaptive interaction patterns contribute to its development and maintenance. These difficulties need to be addressed in context of the intervention (eg, social problem solving), and possibly require adjunct therapies, such as family or group therapy, if the interpersonal problems do not respond to depression-specific individual therapy intervention. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive psychotherapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The adolescent's relationship with his or her therapist is a central therapeutic factor. Without a solid therapeutic working alliance, the effectiveness of psychosocial intervention will be limited. The working alliance is based on trust, genuineness, respect, understanding, and a norm of collaboration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A solid working alliance with the adolescent's parents is key to regular therapy attendance (ie, fewer cancellations and no-shows) and greater therapist concurrence with termination of treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The early stages of treatment need to instill hope that intervention can be effective, depression can remit, and problems are not insurmountable. Instilling hope activates the adolescent's motivation to engage in treatment. Moreover, it is important to attend to hopelessness early in the intervention because hopelessness predicts dropout and poor response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clearly identifying specific psychological and psychosocial processes that are maintaining an adolescent's depression and using these data in clinical decision making is central to providing individualized and effective care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This often includes addressing adolescent-specific issues such as parent-adolescent conflict, separation and individuation concerns, peer pressure, sexual identity, dating, substance use, and school performance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective treatment requires that clinicians obtain ongoing feedback regarding level of symptoms through systematic monitoring of depressed mood and associated symptoms. This objective can be achieved by having adolescents self-monitor using symptom-focused self-report forms that are based upon diagnostic criteria for depression from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70455 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intervention should include psychoeducation regarding relapse prevention and availability of &quot;booster sessions&quot; (maintenance therapy) as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy for adolescents (IPT-A) are not suitable for all depressed adolescents. Both treatments are active therapies, and require motivation on the part of the adolescent for effective implementation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Randomized trials suggest that self guided treatments based upon CBT and delivered through Web sites may be helpful for mild to moderate depressive syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing a therapist</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an adolescent presents with clinically significant depressive symptoms, individual therapy (CBT or IPT-A) typically is the psychosocial treatment of choice. Group therapy generally is not indicated unless the group is a depression-specific CBT group. CBT and IPT-A typically are pursued on an outpatient basis and provided by various licensed mental health clinicians (eg, psychologists, psychiatrists, clinical social workers, and professional counselors).</p><p>The first steps in choosing a therapist involve determining:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The therapist's approach to treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Training in evidence-based approaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experience treating depression in adolescents</p><p/><p>Most psychologists receive formal training in CBT; however, many therapists outside of psychology have training in CBT as well. Training in IPT-A is less common than CBT. One way to find a cognitive-behaviorally oriented therapist is to consult the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT). Another important consideration when choosing a therapist is whether family members are included in the treatment. Treatment typically is more effective when family members (particularly parents) are included to support and maintain treatment gains. Below are some examples of useful questions to ask of the therapist:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is your approach to treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of training or experience do you have treating depression in adolescents?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of training or experience do you have with CBT (or IPT-A)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are family members included in some aspects of the treatment? How?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment planning should be collaborative with the adolescent. His or her family should be well informed and involved in the planning process. The treatment plan should indicate the frequency of sessions based on the severity of symptoms, the age and developmental status of the patient, the degree of current exposure to negative life events, and other clinical factors. Multiple sessions per week may be needed during the acute treatment phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, the plan should recommend involvement of parents in treatment and other interventions directed at the child's environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Description</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a brief psychosocial intervention that is comprised of a variety of therapeutic approaches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73776\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef73776 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53738\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef53738 \">form 2</a>). All of the approaches share the basic assumption that therapeutic change can be effected by targeting changes in thoughts (beliefs and attitudes) and behaviors that contribute to emotional distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Some forms give more emphasis to thoughts or cognitions, whereas others emphasize behaviors.</p><p>The cognitive-focused tradition of CBT is based on the premise that individuals who are depressed have a distorted view of themselves, the world, and the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These cognitive distortions play an important role in depression and can be counteracted through CBT. Examples of cognitive targets for change include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distorted thoughts about specific events, such as all-or-none thinking or perfectionism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maladaptive global perceptions about oneself, the world, and future</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive deficits such as poor social problem solving</p><p/><p>Behavioral activation and improvement in relationships is often &quot;half the battle&quot; in helping adolescents to resume a productive developmental trajectory. Behavioral targets often involve modifying complications of depression that maintain and worsen symptoms. Examples of behavioral targets include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Addressing poor sleep hygiene</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Engagement in physical exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing behaviors that provide pleasure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing behaviors that provide a sense of mastery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improving social skills and social involvement</p><p/><p>Both the cognitive-focused and the behavior-focused approaches have empirical support for efficacy in treatment of depressed adolescents, as discussed below. Regardless of emphasis, the efficacious forms of CBT for depression in adolescents share the following methods or treatment components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing involvement in pleasurable, mood-enhancing activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing quantity and improving quality of social interactions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improving conflict resolution and social problem-solving skills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing physiological tension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modifying or restructuring depressogenic thoughts</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Studies of CBT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of CBT in the treatment of adolescent depression has been studied in controlled trials comparing it with other psychosocial therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>], drug therapy (alone or in combination with CBT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], pill placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], no therapy (ie, waitlist or treatment-as-usual) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], and in meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/7,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15-17</a>]. The lack of standardized entry criteria, outcome measures, and comparison groups makes it difficult to compare the results between studies. The results of the studies vary, as illustrated below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one clinical trial, 107 adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) were randomly assigned to one of three psychosocial treatments: CBT, systemic behavioral family therapy, or nondirective supportive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. More adolescents in the CBT group achieved remission at the end of acute treatment (60 versus approximately 40 percent for family and supportive therapy). In a separate analysis, factors predictive of poor outcome were evaluated. These included clinical referral (versus response to an advertisement), hopelessness, comorbid anxiety, cognitive distortion, and maternal depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another clinical trial, 53 children and adolescents with depressive disorders were randomly assigned to five to eight sessions of CBT or relaxation training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. CBT showed a clear advantage on measures of depression and overall outcome in most patients, but not for those with comorbid anxiety or conduct symptoms. At follow-up, the differences between groups were reduced because of a high relapse rate in the CBT group and continued improvement in the relaxation group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Treatment for Adolescent with Depression Study (TADS), adolescents with MDD were assigned randomly to four treatment groups: CBT alone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> alone, combination CBT and fluoxetine, and pill placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Combination therapy with CBT and fluoxetine was most effective during the acute phase (response rate of 71 percent). The response rate to CBT monotherapy was 43 percent, which was not statistically different from in the pill placebo group (35 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The response rate of CBT monotherapy was lower in TADS than in other studies of CBT. However, in the second phase of TADS (which extended to 36 weeks), the response rate for CBT increased to 65 percent at week 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This supports the hypothesis that the increased severity of illness in TADS patients compared to those in other studies delayed the onset of benefit for CBT relative to other therapies. This is consistent with results of trials in adult patients in which the comparative of strength of CBT is greater during follow-up than acute treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although CBT was less efficacious than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> or combination therapy during the acute phase of treatment, CBT appeared to protect against suicidal ideation, and, when combined with fluoxetine, to protect against suicidal ideation and other harm-related adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Treatment of Resistant Depression In Adolescents (TORDIA) trial, 344 adolescents with MDD unresponsive to treatment with SSRI were randomly assigned to treatment with another SSRI, another SSRI and CBT, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>, or venlafaxine and CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The response rate was greater in patients whose switch included CBT than in those whose who underwent medication switch alone (55 percent [95% CI 47-62 percent] versus 41 percent [95% CI 33-48 percent]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One meta-analysis of six controlled studies comparing CBT for adolescent depression (diagnosed with standardized criteria) to inactive interventions found CBT to be efficacious, with a higher remission rate (62 versus 36 percent, pooled odds ratio 3.2, 95% CI 1.9-5.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another meta-analysis that included studies of adolescent with depressive symptoms as well as those with MDD also found CBT to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effects of comorbidity on benefit from CBT in a group setting were evaluated in a separate analysis of two previously reported studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21</a>], and included 60 depressed adolescents with comorbid conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Overall lifetime comorbidity was unrelated to recovery. However, comorbid anxiety was associated with a greater decrease in depression scores after treatment and comorbid substance <span class=\"nowrap\">abuse/dependence</span> was associated with slower time to recovery. Posttreatment recurrence was more likely in patients with comorbid attention-deficit and disruptive disorders.</p><p/><p>Although CBT is typically administered by clinicians face to face with depressed patients, computerized formats may be a reasonable alternative, particularly if the standard format is not available or is declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. A randomized trial compared a computerized CBT intervention (an interactive fantasy game comprising seven modules, delivered over four to seven weeks) with treatment as usual (primarily face to face counseling, mean number of sessions was 5) in 187 adolescents (aged 12 to 19 years) seeking treatment for mild to moderate depression in primary care settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Three months after the interventions, improvement of symptoms was comparable with computerized CBT and treatment as usual, and adverse events were similar for the two groups. &#160; </p><p>For adolescents with depression plus insomnia, CBT programs that explicitly address both conditions may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Maintenance phase and prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are fewer controlled trials of CBT for treating adolescent depression during the continuation and maintenance phase than the acute phase; most studies indicate that continuation and maintenance treatment is beneficial. As an example [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/13,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial compared CBT plus usual care with usual care alone in 316 adolescents who were followed for up to three years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. At study entry, none of the patients met criteria for a major depressive episode. Most patients had a previous depressive episode and were either euthymic or suffering from subsyndromal depressive symptoms; the remaining patients had no prior history of major depression, but were suffering from subsyndromal symptoms. The format for the intervention was group therapy, consisting of eight weekly sessions followed by six monthly continuation sessions, each session lasting 90 minutes. Depressive episodes occurred in fewer patients who received active treatment than usual care alone (37 versus 48 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients were subsequently followed for up to six years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The incidence of depression was lower in patients who received CBT plus usual care, compared with usual care alone (hazard ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.96). The benefit of CBT occurred primarily in the first nine months of the study, when the intervention was administered; this suggests that monthly booster sessions beyond six months may extend the duration of the effect. However, the benefit of CBT on the risk of depression was observed only in patients whose caretaking parent was not depressed at the time of the intervention, suggesting the importance of co-treatment of parental depression in preventing adolescent depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study compared assessment with &quot;booster&quot; sessions of CBT every four months, assessment alone every four months, and assessment every 12 months for a 24-month period among adolescents who had received an eight-week acute course of CBT for depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although booster sessions did not reduce the rate of recurrence during the follow-up period, they appeared to hasten recovery among adolescents who remained depressed after the initial eight weeks of CBT.</p><p/><p>The efficacy of continuation treatment with CBT plus pharmacotherapy in patients with acute major depression who respond to pharmacotherapy alone is discussed separately.

Discontinuation typically is based on resolution of depressive symptoms (based on standardized rating scales) and the patient's sense of efficacy to maintain gains.

According to this treatment model, there are many possible pathways into depression, but independent of the cause, depression is associated with relationship disruptions. Thus, IPT-A focuses on current relationship problems associated with the adolescent's depression.</p><p>The initial phase of treatment includes exploring the adolescent's relationships by conducting a relationship inventory to identify problem areas that will be the focus of treatment. Typical foci of treatment include grief reactions, interpersonal conflicts (such as parent-child disputes or peer conflicts), role disputes, adjustments and transitions, interpersonal deficits, and adjustments related to single parent families in the context of divorce, separation, incarceration, death, etc.</p><p>The IPT-A approach takes into account developmentally relevant issues for adolescents such as establishing autonomy, negotiating romantic relationships, sexual orientation, managing parent-adolescent tensions, and coping with peer pressures. Through weekly individual intervention, the therapist helps the adolescent identify specific strategies to successfully manage interpersonal difficulties related to his or her depression. Typical IPT-A techniques include promoting effective expression of affect, clarifying and reframing expectations for relationships, communication analysis, social problem solving, and role playing of effective methods of interaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Studies of IPT-A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although IPT-A is not as well studied as CBT, it is established as an evidence-based treatment for depression in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Three of the supporting studies are summarized below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a controlled clinical trial, 48 clinic-referred adolescents (aged 12 to 18 years) with MDD were assigned randomly to either weekly IPT-A or clinical monitoring for 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Outcomes, including symptoms of depression, social functioning, and social problem-solving skills were measured by an independent evaluator who was unaware of the treatment assignment; 32 patients completed the protocol, 21 in the IPT-A group, but only 11 in the control group. Among the control group patients who did not complete the protocol, four patients were removed for suicidality, one for psychotic symptoms, one for school refusal, four for noncompliance, and three withdrawals were patient initiated. Compared with those in the control group, those in the IPT-A group reported decrease in depressive symptoms and greater improvement in social functioning and problem-solving skills. In the intention to treat analysis, more patients in the IPT-A group met recovery criteria (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score &le;6) at week 12 (18 versus 11 of 24).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another controlled trial, 63 adolescents referred to school-based mental health clinics in New York City for depression were randomly assigned to receive IPT-A or treatment as usual for 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Those treated with IPT-A showed greater symptom reduction, improvement in overall functioning, and better overall social functioning than those who received treatment as usual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 71 Puerto Rican adolescents with depression were assigned randomly to one of three groups: IPT, CBT, or placement on a wait list for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Depressive symptoms were reduced in the first two groups compared with the third. After treatment, more adolescents in the IPT group were able to function socially than in the CBT group (82 versus 59 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given IPT-A's time-limited nature, it is not recommended for adolescents with a long-standing history of severe interpersonal dysfunction (eg, personality disorders); rather, it is well suited to those adolescents who have an identifiable interpersonal event that precipitated or clearly exacerbated a depressive episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Similar to CBT, IPT-A is not recommended for youth with markedly limited cognitive or language skills or those who will not engage in treatment. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Typical course of IPT-A'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical course of IPT-A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical course of IPT-A consists of 12 weekly 45-minute sessions (with additional weekly telephone contacts during the first month). Throughout treatment, depressive symptoms and current interpersonal functioning are monitored. The latter portion of treatment involves psychoeducation and planning for <span class=\"nowrap\">relapse/recurrence</span> prevention. Monthly follow-up or maintenance often is provided as indicated based upon the adolescent's management of his or her mood and relationships. Once IPT-A is discontinued, the patient, family, and primary care clinician should monitor patients for recurrence of depression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182433452\"><span class=\"h1\">FAMILY-BASED INTERPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents has been adapted for preadolescents as a therapy called family-based interpersonal psychotherapy. Evidence for the efficacy of this adaptation includes a 14 week randomized trial that compared family-based interpersonal psychotherapy with child centered therapy in children with a depressive syndrome (age 7 to 12 years; n = 38) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Family-based interpersonal psychotherapy focuses upon current peer relationship problems and also involves the family to address parent-child conflicts. Child centered therapy attempts to treat depression through a therapeutic relationship marked by positive regard and empathic understanding, and thus resembles supportive therapy. The trial found that remission occurred in more patients who received family-based interpersonal psychotherapy than child centered therapy (64 versus 31 percent). In addition, anxiety and interpersonal impairment improved more with family-based interpersonal psychotherapy. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUNCTIVE PSYCHOTHERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjunctive psychotherapies that may be warranted depending upon the adolescent's circumstances and functioning include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance abuse treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating disorder treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialectical behavior therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dynamic or long-term psychotherapy approaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive therapy or support groups</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychoeducation</p><p/><p>These interventions have not been proven to address the core symptoms of adolescent depression.

Addressing the adolescent's disability permits more effective psychosocial and psychoeducational functioning, thereby reducing a core source of the adolescent's stress and demoralization. The evaluation and management of learning disabilities and ADHD are discussed separately.

Among the psychosocial treatments, only cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy for adolescents (IPT-A) have been shown to be effective in controlled trials. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CBT is based upon the assumption that targeting changes in thoughts <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behaviors can effect therapeutic change. Effective forms of CBT focus on:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increasing involvement in pleasurable, mood-enhancing activities</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increasing quantity and improving quality of social interactions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Improving conflict resolution and social problem-solving skills</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reducing physiologic tension</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Modifying or restructuring depressogenic thoughts </p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Description'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the acute phase of therapy for moderate or severe depression, CBT is most effective when combined with antidepressant medication. Its role in the durability of response during the maintenance phase of therapy remains to be determined, but it appears to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-unipolar-depression-psychotherapy/abstract/13,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Studies of CBT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IPT-A is based upon the assumption that, independent of the cause of depression, depression is associated with disrupted relationships.

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family-based interpersonal psychotherapy was developed for depressed preadolescents, and focuses upon current peer relationship problems and parent-child conflicts.
