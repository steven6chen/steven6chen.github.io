With the availability of several medications, it is now possible to contemplate combination therapy for hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/combination-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such an approach has proven to be beneficial in patients with HIV infection and those with chronic hepatitis C.

By contrast, eight patients had a flare after treatment that was considered to be a serious adverse event (four following peginterferon with or without lamivudine and four following lamivudine monotherapy).

In a randomized controlled trial, 128 patients with HBeAg negative chronic HBV genotype D were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: peginterferon alfa-2a (180 mcg weekly) for 48 weeks, peginterferon alfa-2a (180 mcg weekly) for 48 weeks followed by 135 mcg weekly for an additional 48 weeks, or combination treatment of peginterferon alfa-2a (180 mcg weekly) and lamivudine (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for 48 weeks followed by peginterferon alfa-2a (135 mcg weekly) for 48 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/combination-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At 48-week post-treatment follow-up, extended treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a alone for 96 weeks as compared with 48 weeks resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving a virological response (HBV DNA &lt;2000 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL:</span> 29 versus 12 percent). However, virological response at the end of treatment or at 24 weeks after treatment was similar. Combination treatment was not associated with a higher virological response as compared with peginterferon alfa-2a alone, regardless of duration. However, only 13 patients in the combination treatment group completed follow-up. There were no significant differences in discontinuation rates in the peginterferon 96-week arms compared with the 48-week arm.

Unfortunately, none of these goals has been achieved convincingly to an extent greater than with currently available monotherapies. This may be because all nucleos(t)ide analogs for HBV have the same viral target. Most studies on combination therapy have focused on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> and the main advantage observed is a reduction in incidence of lamivudine resistance. Given the low rate of antiviral resistance associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> or tenofovir monotherapy, it would be difficult to demonstrate that combination therapy will provide additional benefit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical trials comparing peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> to peginterferon alone suggest that while the initial response rate is higher in the combination therapy group, a sustained response after stopping treatment is not increased. Among patients receiving peginterferon with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a>, no difference in the initial response was observed among those receiving combination therapy verus peginterferon or entecavir alone.
