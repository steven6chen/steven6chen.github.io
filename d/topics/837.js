Both develop from the embryonic cloacal membrane, and are sites of fusions of endodermal and ectodermal tissue to form a squamocolumnar epithelial junction. Both areas may display normal metaplastic change and abnormal dysplastic change related to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82322\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82322 \">figure 1</a>).

Anal cancer is discussed separately.

A two tiered nomenclature is recommended for HPV associated squamous proliferations of the LAT, with low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL respectively), that may be further classified to intraepithelial neoplasia (IN) of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis and anus to grade 1, 2, or 3. For example, AIN 1 corresponds to anal LSIL, and AIN 2 and 3 to anal HSIL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. To be included as HSIL, AIN 2 lesions should be shown to be positive for p16 staining according to the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) project recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. AIN 2 that is p16 negative is classified as LSIL.</p><p>The biologic consequences of anal SIL are considered analogous to those of cervical SIL. Anal HSIL, corresponding to AIN 3- and p16-positive AIN grade 2, is considered premalignant and may progress to anal cancer, similar to the progression of cervical HSIL to cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Anal LSIL, corresponding to AIN 1, is not considered to be a direct precursor of anal cancer, but may progress to HSIL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H705741239\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anal SIL and the histopathologic manifestations of HPV infection are most apparent at the anal transition zone (ATZ) where rectal columnar epithelium and anal squamous epithelium meet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Anal SIL and cervical SIL share cytopathologic features, and both anal and cervical cytology are described using the 2001 Bethesda classification system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71416 \">table 1</a>). Cytologic changes are reported, in increasing severity, as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), LSIL, ASC-suggestive of HSIL (ASC-H), and HSIL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A diagnosis of atypical squamous cells cannot rule out the presence of a higher grade lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A biopsy is diagnosed as HSIL when abnormal basaloid cells, characterized by an increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, replace more than one-half of the epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82322\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82322 \">figure 1</a>). LSIL is diagnosed when 20 to 25 percent of the epithelium is replaced by abnormal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. LSIL is also characterized by the presence of koilocytes, enlarged cells with a cytoplasmic halo surrounding the nucleus that is indicative of active HPV replication. Similar to cytology, anal histopathology may be read out as LSIL or HSIL, with the letter &quot;b&quot; for biopsy or &quot;h&quot; for histology to distinguish a biopsy showing LSIL or HSIL from cytology showing these changes. </p><p>Lesions showing evidence of LSIL may spontaneously regress, as is well documented in the cervix, or progress to HSIL. By contrast, HSIL is less likely to regress, regardless of HIV status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], and lesions containing HPV 16 may be the least likely to regress (SPANC study). Since HSIL is considered to be the true<strong> </strong>precursor of invasive anal squamous cell carcinoma, ablative treatments should be considered, similar to the management of cervical HSIL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. To date, no randomized prospective studies have been done to determine if treatment of anal HSIL is effective in reducing the incidence of anal cancer. However, a randomized prospective study supported by the United States National Cancer Institute and National Institutes of Health Office of AIDS Research is now in progress to address this issue, the Anal <span class=\"nowrap\">Cancer/HSIL</span> Outcomes Research (ANCHOR) study (<a href=\"http://www.anchorstudy.org/&amp;token=PRKPO3uO+dPuh8VYneBd1APT9iJOV811ltBnTV0fQD5wyRWzQEBdrkRUmvl8hl7t&amp;TOPIC_ID=8032\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.anchorstudy.org</a>).</p><p>In the cervix, regression and progression rates for each grade of cervical lesion have been characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, relatively little is known to date about the long-term natural history of anal SIL.

Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, one group has identified 29 individual HPV types and 10 HPV groups from the anal canal of men who have sex with men (MSM), both with and without HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The spectrum of HPV types with both low-risk and high-risk phenotypes in the dysplastic anal canal is similar to that described in the dysplastic cervix. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These observations about the risk factors for anal SIL are consistent with the observed relationship between HPV infection and anal cancer. In certain populations, such as MSM and HIV-infected individuals, there is an especially high incidence of anal cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and epidemiology of anal cancer&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Some individuals, particularly those who are HIV-infected, are more frequently infected with multiple HPV types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>]. This has been associated with both the presence of prevalent anal SIL and also an increased risk of progression from LSIL to HSIL compared to infection with a single HPV type or absence of detectable infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1116102\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk sexual behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-risk sexual behavior in men is associated with anal SIL.</p><p>In a detailed study of 1262 HIV-uninfected MSM, anal SIL, as detected by anal cytology, was present in 20 percent of the population (5 percent with HSIL and 15 percent with LSIL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The age-related prevalence of anal SIL was analyzed in terms of underlying behavior patterns and infection with HPV. Using multivariate analysis, the factors significantly associated with the presence of anal SIL included anal HPV infection, the number and type of HPVs present, and high-risk sexual behavior.</p><p>The prevalence of anal HPV infection in MSM is high at all ages between 18 and 50 years and ranged between 50 and 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It has been suggested that HPV infection is transient and that individuals remain at risk for developing new HPV infections if high-risk behavior continues. The observation that there was no increase in HPV prevalence with increasing age in this population is consistent with this observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This is also consistent with the absence of immunity following initial infection. As expected, the presence of abnormal anal cytology in MSM does not vary with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Both high HPV detection rates and abnormal cytology likely reflect the high number of new sexual partners in these urban MSM.</p><p>In women, there are contrasting findings as HIV-uninfected women whose initial high cervical HPV detection rates and rates of cytological abnormality at younger age groups are not sustained over time. In women, risk factors for anal SIL include a history of receptive anal intercourse and presence of HPV DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. One study showed that anal HPV infection appears to be at least as common as cervical HPV infection in HIV-infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Furthermore, HIV-infected women with abnormal cervical cytology have an increased risk of concurrent abnormal anal cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Anal intercourse is not the only risk factor for acquisition of anal HPV infection in women; a recent study from Tasmania, Australia showed that wiping from front to back post-toilet is associated with higher rates of anal HPV infection than patting or wiping in the other direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV infection is associated with an increased prevalence of HPV infection overall including the most frequent oncogenic strains of HPV in MSM. </p><p>Earlier studies showed a higher incidence of anal HSIL among HIV-infected MSM compared with HIV-uninfected MSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and these results were confirmed in subsequent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a meta-analysis that included data from 53 studies, the prevalence of anal canal HPV of any type was statistically significant greater in HIV-infected individuals compared with those who were HIV uninfected (93 versus 64 percent) and there was also an increase in the prevalence of high risk HPV types (74 versus 37 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Furthermore, HIV infection was associated with a statistically significant increased prevalence of anal SIL (57 versus 19 percent), including both LSIL (28 versus 7 percent) and HSIL (6.7 versus 2.7 percent), as assessed by cytology.</p><p>The increased prevalence of HPV infection and anal SIL may be due to multiple factors including a greater likelihood of high-risk sexual behavior and infection with multiple HPV types and an impaired mucosal immune response that facilitates HPV replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>]. Although lower baseline CD4 cell counts are a risk factor for HSIL in MSM, high rates are found at all CD4 strata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a study of 357 HIV-infected MSM, over 80 percent had anal SIL and 95 percent had HPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In the general population, anal cancer incidence, although increasing, is approximately 2 per 100,000. In contrast, the rate of anal cancer was estimated to be as high as 35 per 100,000 among MSM prior to the HIV epidemic, similar to that of cervical cancer in women prior to the introduction of cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) smear screening. The current incidence of anal cancer among HIV-infected MSM has been estimated to be at least twice that of HIV-uninfected MSM with data from the North American ACCORD study reporting rates of 131 per 100,000 for HIV infected MSM, and 46 per 100,000 for other HIV-infected men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

However, ART does not appear to alter the prevalence of anal SIL, and ART may be associated with an increased incidence progression of HSIL to anal cancer due to the increased life expectancy of HIV infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Multivariate analysis that included length of HIV infection and viral load showed that the use of ART and detection of &ge;6 HPV types were associated with the presence of anal SIL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and epidemiology of anal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HIV infection is also a risk factor for anal SIL in women. This was illustrated in a study in which 251 HIV-infected and 68 high-risk HIV-uninfected women underwent clinical examination including anal cytology, anal HPV testing, and high resolution anoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Compared with HIV-uninfected women, HIV-infected women had an increased risk of abnormal anal cytology (26 versus 8 percent) and high-grade AIN (6 versus 2 percent). Risk factors for anal SIL in this population included a lower CD4 cell count, a higher level of plasma HIV RNA, a history of receptive anal intercourse, and concurrent abnormal cervical cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Others risk factors that have been associated with the development of anal SIL in men include a history of rectal discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], history of genital warts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], injection drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and current cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

In total, 62 percent of HIV-infected and 36 percent of HIV-uninfected men with LSIL at baseline progressed to HSIL. In interpreting these data, it should be remembered that the study did not measure progression of specific LSIL lesions to HSIL, but rather the proportion of patients with LSIL who later developed HSIL. Many if not most LSIL lesions are associated with low-risk HPV types, and do not necessarily progress directly to HSIL. However, the presence of LSIL is a strong predictor of the concurrent presence of oncogenic HPV types and incident HSIL associated with these types. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21979862\"><span class=\"h2\">Regression of HSIL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been a broadly held opinion that intra-anal HSIL only infrequently regresses to lower grades of dysplasia or normal epithelium.

The first was a study of 35 HIV-uninfected patients with biopsy proven HSIL in which three of six immunosuppressed patients with multifocal HSIL developed squamous cell cancer at a median of 5 years following initial HSIL diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The second study of 446 HIV-infected MSM who were followed for 5 years and 10 months during which time 5 men with HSIL who refused treatment developed cancer at a median time of 8.6 months from HSIL diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In both of these studies no information was presented on the evolution of HSIL, so it is not known if the anal cancers developed from incident HSIL or if the HSIL was prevalent at baseline. If prevalent, the length of time to progress from HSIL to cancer will likely be longer than stated. Prospective, carefully controlled studies are needed to define the risk of progression of anal HSIL to invasive cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anal SIL is typically asymptomatic although it may be associated with local symptoms such as pruritus, bleeding, discharge, irritation, and tenesmus.</p><p>The diagnosis of anal SIL ultimately requires histopathological examination of the anal cytology and biopsy specimens.

Given the low incidence of anal cancer among immunosuppressed individuals under the age of 25 years and immunocompetent individuals under the age of 40 years, we generally defer screening HIV-infected individuals and those with other forms of immune suppression until after 25 years of age, and defer screening at-risk immunocompetent individuals until after 40 years of age.</p><p>Numerous studies have documented the high prevalence of anal high-grade SIL in men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly in the setting of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/24,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,40</a>].

For HIV-infected patients, the HIV Medical Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America makes a weak recommendation based on moderate quality evidence for screening with anal cytology in MSM, women with a history of receptive anal intercourse or abnormal cervical Pap test results, and those with genital warts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Methodology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anal screening program relies upon cytology as the initial screening test in high-risk populations. The goal of screening is to identify individuals with abnormal cytology (ASC-US, ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL) who should then ideally undergo high-resolution anoscopy to assess the anal canal and map areas with visual markers consistent with HSIL by biopsy and histopathologic evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H705741239\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Anal cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anal exfoliative cytology should be performed using a water-moistened polyester fiber (not cotton) swab to collect cells prior to anoscopy or anal examination. Patients should be instructed to avoid anal sex, douching, and the use of enemas prior to this procedure, since these practices may decrease the cellular yield. </p><p>The patient is positioned in the left lateral position, and the swab gently inserted until the swab cannot be advanced any further because it has reached the wall of the rectum, thus positioning the swab proximal to the anorectal transformation zone (squamocolumnar junction). The swab is then withdrawn with lateral pressure using a spiral motion to sample the entire circumference of the anal canal. Since the procedure is performed blindly, cells from the lower rectum, squamocolumnar transformation zone, and anal canal are sampled.</p><p>After removal, the sample may be fixed either conventionally with ethanol or processed using a liquid cytology technique before staining with the Papanicolaou method. The latter method is preferable, when available, since it may yield better results among clinicians with limited experience in performing anal cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although other liquid cytology media are available, none have been specifically tested with anal specimens. </p><p>The sensitivity of anal cytology to detect biopsy-proven anal squamous intraepithelial lesions in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected MSM was 81 and 50 percent, respectively, when results from multiple screenings were considered and when ASC-US results were included in the &quot;abnormal&quot; category. This is similar to that the sensitivity of cervical cytology for the detection of cervical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. </p><p>Self-collection of anal cytology samples appears to have similar sensitivity to that of clinician-collected samples, and may serve to increase patient compliance and decrease the cost of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. This was illustrated by a series of 125 MSM, in which self-collected and clinician collected samples were compared with the results of high-resolution anoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Overall, 66 percent of the cohort was positive for HPV and 30 percent had biopsy-proven HSIL. Among those who were HIV infected, the sensitivity of cytology to detect anal SIL was 75 and 90 percent, respectively, for self- and clinician-collected samples. Among those who were HIV uninfected, the sensitivities were 48 and 62 percent, respectively.</p><p>Another cross-sectional study of HIV-uninfected MSM demonstrated adequate anal cytology in 92 percent of clinician-collected samples compared to 83 percent in self-collected samples (p&lt;0.001) with both groups using the same liquid cytology collection method at the same clinic visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Most cytological diagnoses were of lower grades such as ASC-US and LSIL. However there were less frequent diagnoses of anal SIL than in the predominantly HIV-infected group 21 versus 33 to 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Other data suggest that anal cytology is an inaccurate predictor of the presence of HSIL, regardless of HIV status. One series included 153 MSM (100 HIV-infected) who were referred to an anal dysplasia clinic because of abnormal screening anal cytology (n = 46), HSIL on pathologic evaluation of surgically removed anogenital condylomata (n = 25), or a history of internal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> external anal condylomata (n = 54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. When compared to the histologic findings, the sensitivity of anal cytology was only 47 percent for detection of a HSIL histological finding (AIN grade 2 or 3, or invasive squamous cell cancer). Moreover, a cytologic diagnosis of ASC-US (n = 30) showed a nearly equal distribution of histologic grade (with histology being normal, AIN 1, AIN 2, or AIN 3 in 11, 7, 5, and 7 participants, respectively). Thus, the presence of any abnormal anal cytologic finding indicates a potential for HGAIN on histologic examination. These results are consistent with those reported in an earlier larger series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Collectively, these data suggest that when HSIL is found on anal cytology there is a high probability of HSIL disease on high-resolution anoscopy-guided biopsy. The finding of LSIL or ASC-US on cytology, however, does not exclude the presence of HSIL. For this reason, referral for high-resolution anoscopy should be considered for individuals with any cytologic abnormality.</p><p>Alternatively, individuals considered to be at high risk for anal SIL, such as HIV-infected MSM, may be referred directly for high-resolution anoscopy and biopsy given the well-documented, high prevalence of anal SIL in these individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">High-resolution anoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If abnormal anal cytology is present, the next step in the diagnostic evaluation is high-resolution anoscopy. This procedure allows the clinician to visualize lesions that represent the source of the abnormal cells and obtain biopsy specimens for histopathologic assessment. As in the cervix, anal histopathology is necessary to grade the severity of the disease, as this cannot be accurately established by visual evaluation or cytology alone. The goal of the biopsy is to identify HSIL or anal cancer since these may be targeted for prevention and treatment of anal cancer, respectively.</p><p>By wrapping a 4x4 gauze swab around a Q-tip, then soaking it in 3-5 percent acetic acid, the acid may be applied evenly to the anal canal prior to visualization. The acetic acid produces a white appearance in areas of abnormal transitional epithelium and facilitates mucosal examination for anoscopy as it does for cervical colposcopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Anoscopic changes most often associated with high-grade AIN are similar to those seen in cervical colposcopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Specifically, these abnormalities are the presence of acetowhite change on <span class=\"nowrap\">flat/slightly</span> raised or thickened epithelium with or without abnormal blood vessels (mosaic <span class=\"nowrap\">pattern/punctuation)</span>. Tissues with these features that stain negatively with Lugol&rsquo;s iodine should be considered highly suspicious for HSIL and biopsied. Tissues that do not take up Lugol&rsquo;s stain in the absence of these features may also contain HSIL and should be considered for biopsy, particularly when the patient has HSIL on cytology. Patterns associated with HSIL on biopsy versus LSIL on biopsy have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost-effectiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that periodic screening of both HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected MSM may be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. In one study, a state&ndash;transition Markov model was developed to calculate lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy for no screening versus several screening strategies in a population of HIV-infected MSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Topical application of TCA is generally well tolerated, but can occasionally be painful. </p><p>In a study of 72 HIV positive men with 98 HSIL, 79 percent of lesions resolved to normal epithelium or LSIL, and only two lesions (2 percent) required more than two treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Similar results were obtained in a study of 54 men, 65 percent of whom were HIV positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In both studies, TCA was more effective in younger patients.</p><p>Preliminary data suggest that a course of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> may also be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. A 16-week course of self-administered twice weekly treatment resulted in a complete response in 18 and a partial response in eight (overall response rate 57 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune modulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A course of self-applied, intra-anal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, an immune modulator, can result in pathological resolution of anal SIL in HIV-infected MSM on HAART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. This approach may be best for patients with widespread, multifocal disease.</p><p>In one reported series, 64 men with HSIL were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> or placebo, applied to the anal canal three times per week for four months. Of the 28 patients given imiquimod, four had complete resolution and eight had the HSIL downgraded to LSIL. Only one of 25 patients on placebo had resolution of HSIL. At a median follow-up of three years, 61 percent of patients had sustained absence of HSIL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Infrared coagulation and hyfrecation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For lesions that are too large for TCA, office-based infrared coagulation (IRC) can be used. This device is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hemorrhoids and for anal warts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home and office treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment consists of the direct application of a 1.5 second pulse of irradiation in the infrared range to dysplastic anal epithelium, which results in tissue destruction to a depth of approximately 1.5 mm. The coagulated tissue can then be debrided using Tischler biopsy forceps. Possible procedure-related complications include immediate and delayed bleeding and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>IRC is not yet FDA approved for treatment of anal SIL. Multiple studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of IRC, in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/67-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-71</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective study of 96 men, treatment with IRC was followed by recurrence in 62 percent of those who were HIV uninfected in a mean of 14 months, and 91 percent of those who were HIV infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Although multiple retreatments were required in the majority of cases, none of the men progressed to squamous cell carcinoma. There were no serious adverse events.</p><p>Hyfrecation is also commonly used to treat anal HSIL. It has a similar efficacy profile to IRC Marks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Some clinicians prefer it to IRC because it may be faster than IRC, particularly for large and keratotic lesions. It is also easier to use than IRC for perianal disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Anoscopy-directed lesion ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For lesions that are too large for office-based local therapy, high-resolution anoscopy can be used to visually define areas of involvement for electrocautery ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. For patients with circumferential or very extensive lesions, this approach may require a staged approach using multiple procedures. The use of high-resolution anoscopy, rather than mapping biopsies, may minimize complications.</p><p>The effectiveness and safety of this approach was illustrated by a retrospective review of the experience with 246 patients treated at the University of California San Francisco over a ten-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Overall, 200 patients (81 percent) were treated with a single procedure, although 57 percent of these did develop recurrent disease at an average of 19 months after the initial procedure. In 46 patients (19 percent), multiple staged treatments were required for complete lesion ablation. Significant complications were observed in only nine patients (including one with bleeding requiring reoperation, two with anal stenosis, and four with anal fissures). </p><p>Similar results were observed in a series of 232 men treated with electrocautery in New York City [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The probability of disease control of the initial lesion after a single treatment was approximately 80 percent. Recurrent disease occurred in both HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected men (53 and 61 percent, respectively), but only one patient (0.4 percent) progressed to anal squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p>The high rate of local recurrence, even in patients initially thought to have been completely ablated with a single procedure, mandates careful surveillance following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Nonetheless, most such recurrences can be successfully managed with office-based therapy. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For some patients with extensive HSIL, none of the currently available therapeutic options will likely result in complete clearance, even if a stepped (staged) procedure is used. Clinical judgment may dictate less aggressive management, with a &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach.</p><p>If this approach is chosen, patients should be instructed to report any new anal symptoms that may suggest progression to invasive anal cancer (eg, bleeding, continuous pain, or the development of a mass), and they should be seen every three to four months for repeat high-resolution anoscopy. Patients in whom eradication of HSIL is not complete require careful monitoring, since HSIL can progress to invasive cancer relatively rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Routine follow-up evaluation increases the likelihood that if a cancer develops, it will be diagnosed at a very early stage, increasing the likelihood that curative treatment can be applied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380099268\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only limited data are available comparing different treatment modalities in men with HSIL. In the only randomized trial, 156 men were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, or electrocautery. All grades of anal SIL were included; HSIL was present in 57 percent of cases. Patients with perianal SIL constituted 17 percent of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Among the 148 patients actually treated (modified intent to treat), the complete response rates with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, and electrocautery were 24, 17, and 39 percent, respectively. Recurrences were common, and by 72 weeks after initial treatment the cumulative recurrence rates were 71, 58, and 68 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttreatment surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to high rates of recurrence and evolving anal SIL, surveillance is required following initial treatment. Although the optimal schedule has not been established, our approach is to follow up in four to six months, including a re-biopsy of the treatment site if there is lesion persistence. Anal cytology may also be useful as an adjunctive test to confirm lesion clearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIANAL HSIL AND CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPV related condylomatous perianal disease presents much more frequently to clinicians than does internal SIL. Standard therapeutic approaches for these lesions are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-management-of-external-condylomata-acuminata-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts): Management of external condylomata acuminata in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, perianal squamous intraepithelial lesions (Bowen's disease, squamous cell skin cancer in situ) are less well described and recognized. In 1912, Bowen first described the lesions that bear his name as chronic, red or hyperpigmented, well-defined scaly plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Histologic examination shows HSIL without dermal invasion. Perianal HSIL is less often associated with HPV than those involving the anal canal, and approximately 5 percent of these lesions progress to invasive squamous cell cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Other studies have confirmed the malignant potential of these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>]. Treatment modalities for Bowen's disease include electrodessication and curettage, and excisional surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imiquimod</a> or topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> cream may also be tried. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anal SIL of varying grades may occur in the perianal skin without classical Bowenoid appearances, and unfortunately there is a paucity of clinical literature describing the gross or anoscopic appearances of these lesions. As with intra-anal squamous intraepithelial lesions, there are no nationally recognized treatment guidelines for perianal squamous intraepithelial lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rates of anal cancer are increasing in the general population and are particularly high in HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM). The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has not altered the prevalence of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), and may be associated with an increased incidence of progression to anal cancer due to the longer life expectancy of HIV infected individuals. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The biologic consequences of anal SIL are considered analogous to those of cervical SIL. Anal HSIL has been demonstrated to progress to invasive anal cancer in limited series, providing the rationale for active treatment. (See <a href=\"#H705741461\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For at-risk populations, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90900\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90900 \">table 2</a>) it is appropriate to discuss the risk of anal cancer and the symptoms that should lead to a consultation with a clinician and digital anorectal examination. It is inappropriate to screen this population with anal cytology without local expertise in result interpretation and availability of a referral structure for high-resolution anoscopy with biopsy that also includes access to ablative treatments and follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Screening for anal SIL'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HPV vaccines can significantly decrease the incidence of infection with the HPV types associated with cervical and anal cancer. This decrease was associated with a decrease in the development of anal SIL in MSM in a population of young men with no more than five lifetime sexual partners. Recommendations for the use of HPV vaccines are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H445943593\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the optimal approach has not been defined, our approach is to treat patients with HSIL. Treatment for those with low-grade SIL is optional. A randomized trial is underway to further inform the optimal approach. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although treatment with a variety of approaches may result in complete regression, recurrences are frequent and post-treatment surveillance is necessary. The availability of treatment modalities for HSIL varies by geographic location and the presence of clinical expertise and familiarity with this disease.
