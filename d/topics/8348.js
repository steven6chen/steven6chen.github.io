Pathogens that are frequently identified in patients with these infections include respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, and adenovirus. However, despite improved methods for identifying viral pathogens, the etiology remains undetermined in a significant number of patients.</p><p>In 2001, investigators from the Netherlands discovered a new virus associated with respiratory disease in children and designated it human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Data suggest that hMPV has been responsible for respiratory tract infections for at least 60 years with a worldwide distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>The virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of hMPV will be discussed here. Other common respiratory viruses are reviewed separately.

This taxon was formerly a subfamily within the Paramyxoviridae family but was reclassified in 2016 as a separate family with two genera, <em>Metapneumovirus </em>(which includes hMPV) and <em>Orthopneumovirus</em> (which includes respiratory syncytial virus).</p><p>HMPV is an enveloped virus with a nonsegmented negative-sense RNA genome. HMPV is most closely related phylogenetically to avian metapneumovirus (APV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The complete genome sequence reveals a high level of homology with APV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Phylogenetic analysis has identified two subgroups of hMPV, subgroups A and B, and two clades within each of these subgroups (designated A1, A2, B1, and B2), which often circulate concurrently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. A study of 727 Australian hMPV isolates was undertaken from 2001 to 2004 to determine the epidemiologic profile of genetic subtypes associated with acute respiratory tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Concurrent annual circulation of all four hMPV subtypes was common, although a single, and usually different, hMPV subtype predominated each year.</p><p>Given the close relationship between hMPV and APV, it was speculated that hMPV might have originated from birds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although genetically similar, animal experiments have shown that hMPV is not an avian virus, since it does not infect chickens or turkeys. In contrast, inoculation of macaque monkeys with hMPV did lead to significant viral replication restricted to the respiratory tract with the subsequent development of upper respiratory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Circulating virus strains exhibit minor genetic diversity, but there is no evidence to date that strains vary significantly in their virulence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral replication has been demonstrated in the respiratory tracts of experimentally infected chimpanzees and monkeys and is associated with mild upper respiratory tract signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The integrin alpha-V-beta-1 has been identified as a receptor that facilitates infection of epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a mouse model, viral RNA and significant airway inflammation were prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Infection also was associated with mucus hyperproduction and hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium, with resultant airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> challenge. These data are consistent with that from studies of other respiratory viruses, suggesting that the pathogenesis of severe respiratory infections in childhood may be associated with the development of, or susceptibility to, asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is likely that transmission occurs by direct or close contact with contaminated secretions, which may involve large particle aerosols, droplets, or fomites, but not small particle aerosols. Physical separation at distances &ge;6 feet therefore interrupts aerosol transmission. Nosocomial infections have been reported in hospitalized children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], including in a pediatric hematology-oncology ward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and in hospitalized adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Transmission to family members appears to be very efficient when an index case becomes ill, with an estimated five-day interval between the onset of symptoms in an index patient and the onset of symptoms in contacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon reports from the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], Finland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>], Kenya [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], Norway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and many other countries, the virus is ubiquitous and has been associated with infection for at least 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>].</p><p>HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infection in patients of all age groups, but symptomatic disease most often occurs in young children or older adults. In a Canadian series of 37 patients, 35 percent occurred in children under the age of 5 and 46 percent in adults above the age of 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Many infected children are under the age of one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>HMPV appears to have a seasonal variation: late winter and early spring in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Finland, and late spring and summer in Hong Kong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/1,12,22,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,22,25,26</a>]. However, one summer outbreak of respiratory hMPV illnesses was described in 26 residents and 13 staff members in a United States&ndash;based long-term care facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>One study suggested that the co-circulation of diverse related respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza virus may reduce the incidence of symptomatic hMPV infection due to transient cross-protective immunity induced by the related viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Neutralizing antibodies in the serum of patients that cross-neutralize these viruses are difficult to study, but the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize both RSV and hMPV suggests that partial cross-immunity for these viruses may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Trends in hMPV infections in the United States are monitored by the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System and can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/hmpv/index.html&amp;token=XSomoDalRfq3sELWpLJfkzwOP4pAMMd56C9oPh4IjPD6EBl1e2bUOz17Rzvc3SGMqUlYD2Wnzlk+W5bm86+czg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=8311\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First infections occur early in life. Seroprevalence data suggest that most children are infected by the age of five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In studies of children with acute respiratory illnesses, hMPV has been detected in approximately 5 to 15 percent of patients, most commonly in infants &lt;1 year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/22-25,27-30,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25,27-30,32,33</a>].</p><p>Younger age may be associated with hMPV disease requiring hospitalization. In a population-based surveillance study in the United States, hMPV was detected in 13 percent of children hospitalized with pneumonia; the incidence was higher in children &lt;5 years of age than children &ge;5 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In approximately half of cases, it was detected alone, and in half it was detected together with another pathogen. In children less than 3 years of age who were hospitalized or presented to a clinic with hMPV infection, factors independently associated with hospitalization included age &lt;6 months and the presence of three or more children in the household [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Among children who were hospitalized, factors independently associated with severe disease were female sex, prematurity, and genotype B infection.</p><p>The prevalence of hMPV was higher in children less than three years of age who were hospitalized for wheezing compared with hospitalized controls without wheezing (8.9 versus 1.3 percent); however, hMPV did not play a significant role in symptomatic respiratory disease in children older than three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. History of prematurity is a risk factor for hospitalization with hMPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In another study, the majority of inpatients and outpatients less than five years of age with hMPV infection had no underlying conditions, although premature birth and asthma were more frequent among hospitalized children with hMPV than among those without hMPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Children hospitalized with hMPV infection (as compared with those hospitalized without hMPV infection) were older and more likely to receive a diagnosis of pneumonia or asthma, to require supplemental oxygen, and to have a longer stay in the intensive care unit. HMPV can cause fatal respiratory illness; a cluster of severe disease was reported in which most patients were Native American, a group that may be at increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HMPV upper respiratory tract infection occurs in adults, but its frequency as a cause of an acute lower respiratory illness appears to be lower than in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/16,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,39-42</a>]. In a population-based surveillance study in the United States, hMPV was detected in about 4 percent of hospitalized adults with community-acquired pneumonia, mostly as a single pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Frail older adult patients with hMPV infection are most likely to require medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].HMPV has also been detected from asymptomatic individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serosurveys suggest that hMPV is usually associated with mild, self-limited infections in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/16,22,23,25,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22,23,25,39</a>]. The incubation period is not fully defined but is thought to be five to six days in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The kinetics of virus shedding and the relationship between virus shedding and clinical symptoms are not known with precision because human challenge studies have not been performed with wild-type virus. The typical course of mild disease probably involves an asymptomatic period of several days after inoculation, followed by a week of upper respiratory symptoms, with gradual resolution. The typical peak of virus shedding is likely to be about one week after inoculation, and the peak day of symptoms likely follows within a day or two of peak shedding. In severe disease involving the lower respiratory tract, the typical course appears to involve a brief asymptomatic period after inoculation, followed by a day or two of upper respiratory symptoms, which progress to wheezing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other signs of lower respiratory tract involvement. In many patients, the wheezing lasts for several days; however, individuals with a predisposition to reactive airways disease may exhibit prolonged airway dysfunction, with recurrent mild wheezing and cough for days or even several weeks.</p><p>Among patients who require hospitalization, clinical manifestations can range from bronchiolitis or asthma exacerbation to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/33,39,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,39,44-46</a>].</p><p>No specific clinical features distinguish hMPV from other viral causes of bronchiolitis or pneumonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have described the clinical manifestations of hMPV infection in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/22,23,25,45,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23,25,45,47,48</a>]. The range and frequency of symptoms and signs was illustrated in three series that included approximately 150 children with hMPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough &ndash; 68 to 90 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhinitis &ndash; 44 to 77 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; 52 to 86 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing &ndash; 51 to 56 percent</p><p/><p>Symptoms of upper respiratory infection include rhinopharyngitis and laryngitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>].</p><p>The clinical diagnoses that were made among 49 children with lower respiratory tract infection in one of the above reports were bronchiolitis (59 percent), croup (18 percent), exacerbation of asthma (14 percent), and pneumonia (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>An association with wheezing and exacerbation of asthma has been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/17,23,25,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23,25,48</a>]. As an example, in a Finnish study, which assessed 132 consecutive admissions for wheezing in children who had not taken glucocorticoids in the preceding four weeks, hMPV was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 10 cases (9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The most common reasons for hospitalization in hMPV-infected children are acute bronchiolitis and pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/33,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,45</a>]. The median total hospitalization cost per patient in one study was over five thousand dollars, with significantly higher costs for patients with chronic medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Disease severity may be increased when there is coinfection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Among RSV-infected children less than two years of age, coinfection with hMPV has been associated with severe RSV bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>], the need for admission to the intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], and a 10-fold increase in the need for mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Other studies, however, have not identified a high rate of coinfections in hospitalized patients, so the clinical significance of finding RSV and hMPV RNA in the same sample is uncertain. It is not known if primary hMPV infection that is severe or early in life predisposes to asthma or to a higher frequency of subsequent wheezing associated respiratory illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of wheezing in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study, immunization of HIV-infected children with pneumococcal vaccine reduced the prevalence of hMPV-associated lower respiratory tract illnesses, suggesting an interaction between hMPV and bacteria in severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Encephalitis has been reported rarely in children with upper respiratory tract hMPV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. In one report of fatal encephalitis in a 14-month-old boy, reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of both brain and lung tissue during the post-mortem were positive for hMPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In another report, hMPV was detected by PCR from the cerebrospinal fluid and nasal washings of a 10-year-old girl with severe acute encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging of both patients demonstrated multifocal cortical and subcortical lesions. It is not clear whether hMPV is causative in these cases, since virus replication is thought to be limited to the respiratory tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of hMPV infection in adults are similar to those seen in children.

Since all children become infected in the first years of life, all adult infections represent reinfections. Reinfections appear to be mild, although immunocompromised patients may be at risk of severe disease during reinfection. In a case report, for example, a young child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed recurrent infections with distinct hMPV strains during two consecutive winters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Antigenic drift, the molecular basis underlying many reinfections with influenza, likely occurs to some extent with hMPV, but such drift probably is not necessary for reinfection. An analysis of sequences derived from isolates over a 20-year period suggest that point mutations do occur over time; however, hMPV does not appear to sustain a linear accumulation of drift mutations that result in antigenic drift over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

However, hMPV infections may be more severe and the course more prolonged in immunocompromised patients due to poor clearance of virus after infection has been established. The role that hMPV may play in immunocompromised hosts has been evaluated in several studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort of 688 patients who underwent bronchoscopy was tested for the presence of a variety of respiratory pathogens, including hMPV, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial wash specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. HMPV was detected from six patients, four of whom were immunocompromised; the most common condition was lung transplantation. The rate of detection of hMPV was similar to that of RSV infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 251 episodes of upper and lower respiratory tract infection in patients with hematologic malignancies, 9 percent of episodes were associated with hMPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Sixteen of the 22 episodes occurred in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients; three of nine patients with hMPV-related lower respiratory tract disease died.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective survey of HCT recipients who had BAL sampling performed because of respiratory illness, hMPV was isolated from 5 of 163 patients (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Infected patients became symptomatic within 40 days after transplantation. Initial symptoms included fever, cough, nasal congestion, and sore throat; four of five infected patients died.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 21 patients undergoing HCT, persistent nasopharyngeal hMPV infection was demonstrated in most study participants for several months, although these patients were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. These data suggest impaired clearance, as documented in other immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. A nosocomial outbreak in an allogeneic HCT unit has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large study in South Africa showed that the incidence of hMPV-associated hospitalization was higher in HIV-infected persons compared with HIV-uninfected persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high burden of hMPV infections has been reported in patients with cancer, especially those with hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe hMPV infections can occur following HCT. Progression from upper to lower respiratory tract disease occurred in up to 60 percent of HCT recipients with risk factors that included systemic glucocorticoid use and low lymphocyte counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p/><p>In a retrospective study of 55 immunocompromised children with hMPV infection, 16 (29 percent) presented with lower respiratory tract infection, 12 (23 percent) required intensive care unit admission <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supplemental oxygen with &ge;28 percent FiO<sub>2</sub>, and 3 (5 percent) died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

At least two factors contributed to the delay in identifying this agent: the clinical manifestations are not unique, and hMPV grows slowly and inefficiently in culture. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive and commonly used method for diagnosis of hMPV infection.</p><p>In temperate areas, hMPV should be suspected in cases of acute respiratory tract illness in the late winter. Testing to achieve a specific diagnosis of hMPV in the setting of severe respiratory tract illness is helpful to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics and to isolate patients properly in the hospital</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191388378\"><span class=\"h2\">Reverse-transcriptase PCR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for viral RNA in human respiratory secretions using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in both conventional and real-time formats has been developed with a variety of different primers and probes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/1,22,23,33,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22,23,33,39</a>]. As noted above, RT-PCR is the most sensitive method for diagnosis of hMPV infection, but the primers and techniques are not standardized among laboratories. Currently, RT-PCR tests for hMPV as a single target are available in research laboratories and a limited number of commercial diagnostic laboratories.</p><p>The BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel assay, a multiplex PCR panel, has been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration for simultaneous testing for the presence of hMPV and a variety of other pathogens including strains of adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, <span class=\"nowrap\">rhinovirus/enterovirus,</span> respiratory syncytial virus, <em>Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, </em>and <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].

Only about one-half of cultures that are positive for hMPV by RT-PCR yield cultivable virus by current techniques. Shell vial centrifugation cultures can be used for rapid diagnosis of hMPV, mostly in research settings, with detection using monoclonal antibodies. With this technique, virus can be detected as early as one to two days after inoculation, which could offer an advantage over routine culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for the presence of hMPV-reactive antibodies is not used clinically on a routine basis but is used in epidemiology studies and vaccine research settings.

Patients with known hMPV infection who require hospitalization should be cared for in single rooms or placed with a cohort of hMPV-infected patients. When feasible, patients with RSV infection should be cared for in a separate area from hMPV-infected patients, since coinfection can occur and may be associated with more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-metapneumovirus-infections/abstract/50,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,52</a>].
