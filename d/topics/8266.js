The hair is dark and thick, and grows in places where only men tend to grow dark hair. This includes the upper lip (mustache area), chin, sideburn area, chest, back, and upper part of the belly. Hirsutism is common. Women with hirsutism often find it very upsetting. It affects as many as 1 in 10 women who have not gone through menopause yet. (Menopause is the time in a woman's life when she naturally stops having periods.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195394754\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes hirsutism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women have extra body hair because of their family background. They might be bothered by it, but it is not a sign of a hormonal problem. Other women get hirsutism because they have high levels of male hormones, called &quot;androgens.&quot; Testosterone is the most important androgen. High levels are normal in men. Women normally have much lower levels than men.</p><p>The most common condition that leads to extra androgens in women is called &quot;polycystic ovary syndrome&quot; (PCOS). This condition also causes irregular periods, weight gain, acne, and other symptoms.</p><p>There are some more serious causes of hirsutism (tumors in the ovary or adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys). But these are very rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195394761\"><span class=\"h1\">What other symptoms should I watch for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Watch for other symptoms of PCOS. Women with PCOS might have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irregular periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acne</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity or weight gain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair loss from the scalp</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195394768\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should see your doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have hirsutism that appeared suddenly, or is getting worse quickly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Think you have PCOS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are bothered by your excess hair and want treatment</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195394775\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation.</p><p>Possible tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to measure hormone levels</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic ultrasound &ndash; This test uses sound waves to make a picture of your uterus and ovaries. The pictures can show if you have PCOS or another problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as CT or MRI scans &ndash; These can show if a tumor is causing the problem.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195394782\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to treat the condition?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you are overweight or obese, losing weight can lower androgen levels and improve symptoms. Losing just 5 percent of your body weight can help a lot. That adds up to 10 pounds of weight loss for a 200-pound woman.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195394789\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hirsutism treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing your hirsutism and how bad your symptoms are. You might not need treatment. If you do, possible treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth control pills. These are the most common treatment. They lower androgen levels and make periods regular.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines called anti-androgens, which lower androgen levels or block the effects of androgens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removing extra hair or making it harder to see. Ways of doing this include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shaving or plucking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chemicals and wax that remove hair</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bleaching to make hair lighter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Creams that slow the growth of hair on the face</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrolysis, which uses a tiny needle and a mild electrical zap to destroy hair roots one by one. Electrolysis works best on small areas of skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laser hair removal, which uses a laser to destroy hairs. This procedure works faster and is less painful than electrolysis. It is also more expensive. Most women need 4 to 6 treatments that happen every month or so. Women need to stay on their medication during and after laser treatment, or the hair will gradually grow back.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195394796\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with hirsutism are able to get pregnant. If you have PCOS, and you are overweight, losing weight can also make it easier to get pregnant. There are also medicines that can help you get pregnant. You should not take medicines to control hair growth if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195394803\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having extra hair makes most women feel self-conscious. None of the treatments make the hair go away completely. But they make it grow more slowly and help to decrease the amount of hair. Most women eventually feel better about their appearance. If you are not happy with the results of your treatment, ask your doctor about other options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195394873\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycystic-ovary-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Polycystic ovary syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hirsutism-excess-hair-growth-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hirsutism (excess hair growth in women) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
