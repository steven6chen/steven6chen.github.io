Focus on the acute phase phenomenon, termed the acute phase response, first occurred with the discovery of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the serum of patients during the acute phase of pneumococcal pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. During the acute phase response, the usual levels of various proteins maintained by homeostatic mechanisms can change substantially. These changes are thought to contribute to host defense and other adaptive capabilities.</p><p>A discussion of the biology of the acute phase response; the general clinical utility and interpretation of measurement of APR, such as CRP; and the clinical utility of indirect measures of the acute phase response, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), are presented here. Detailed reviews of disorders associated with variations in APR and the utility of APR measurements in specific conditions, the innate immune response, and the role of cytokines in immunity and inflammation are described separately (see appropriate topic reviews of individual clinical disorders). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of cytokines in the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56057146\"><span class=\"h1\">THE ACUTE PHASE RESPONSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56057153\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition and regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite its name, the acute phase response accompanies both acute and chronic inflammatory states and is associated with a wide variety of disorders, including infection, trauma, infarction, inflammatory arthritides and other systemic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and various neoplasms. Acute phase proteins are defined as those proteins whose serum concentrations increase or decrease by at least 25 percent during inflammatory states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such proteins are termed either positive or negative acute phase reactants (APR), respectively. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), an indirect APR, reflects plasma viscosity and the presence of acute phase proteins, especially fibrinogen, as well as other influences, some of which are as yet unidentified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Erythrocyte sedimentation rate'</a> below.)</p><p>Changes in the levels of APR largely reflect altered production by hepatocytes, resulting primarily from the effects of cytokines produced during the inflammatory process by macrophages, monocytes, and a variety of other cells. Interleukin (IL)-6 is the major inducer of most APR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some of the other major cytokines relevant to the acute phase response are IL-6, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon gamma. These cytokines also suppress the synthesis of albumin, which is termed a &quot;negative APR&quot; because its levels decrease with inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Combinations of cytokines can have additive, inhibitory, or synergistic effects, and patterns of cytokine production differ under various inflammatory conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of cytokines in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Increases in APR can vary from approximately 50 percent for ceruloplasmin and several components of the complement cascade to 1000-fold or more for C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA). Additional positive APR include fibrinogen, levels of which have substantial effects on the ESR; alpha-1 antitrypsin; haptoglobin; IL-1 receptor antagonist; hepcidin; ferritin; procalcitonin; and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12</a>]. Negative APR include albumin, transferrin, and transthyretin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56057160\"><span class=\"h2\">Function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assumption that APR are largely beneficial is based upon the known functions of the individual proteins, but is also influenced by speculation as to how they may serve useful purposes in inflammation, healing, or adaptation to noxious stimuli. Inflammation is a complex, highly orchestrated process that involves many cell types and molecules which may initiate, amplify, sustain, attenuate, or abolish inflammation. A number of the participating molecules are also multifunctional, contributing to both the waxing and the waning of inflammation at different points in time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H55783368\" class=\"local\">'Roles of CRP'</a> below and <a href=\"#H55783889\" class=\"local\">'Roles of other proteins'</a> below.)</p><p>The acute phase response is not uniformly beneficial, and a number of behavioral, physiologic, biochemical, and nutritional changes are induced during the response by inflammation-associated cytokines. In addition to fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] and the development of anemia of chronic disease (also termed anemia of chronic inflammation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], the response can be associated with behavioral changes, such as anorexia, somnolence, and lethargy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]; neuroendocrine effects, such as increased production of corticotropin-releasing hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]; muscle wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]; cachexia; impaired growth in children; altered serum concentrations of various cations, including iron, copper, and zinc; and secondary (AA or reactive) amyloidosis. Cytokine overproduction and imbalance can be fatal, as in septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-sepsis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of sepsis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55783368\"><span class=\"h3\">Roles of CRP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRP and many other APR can influence multiple stages of inflammation, and CRP has both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory actions, although the primary effect may be antiinflammatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. CRP can promote the recognition and elimination of pathogens and enhance the clearance of necrotic and apoptotic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/26-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-32</a>]. The protein consists of five identical, non-covalently associated subunits, each with a molecular weight of approximately 23 kD, which are arranged symmetrically around a central pore [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. CRP and related proteins with this structure are termed pentraxins, which are a family of pattern recognition molecules involved in the innate immune response; others include serum amyloid P and a number of pattern recognition molecules referred to as long pentraxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system#H9421037\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;, section on 'Pentraxins'</a>.)</p><p>A major function of CRP is its ability to bind phosphocholine, thereby permitting recognition both of foreign pathogens that display this moiety and phospholipid constituents of damaged cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. CRP can also activate the complement system and bind to phagocytic cells via Fc receptors, suggesting that it can initiate elimination of pathogens and targeted cells by interaction with both humoral and cellular effector systems of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These functions of CRP may have negative effects in some settings. As an example, CRP levels are increased in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), where CRP may amplify antibody-mediated platelet destruction upon binding to phosphocholine that is exposed after oxidation triggered by antiplatelet antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Proinflammatory effects of CRP include activation of the complement system and the induction in monocytes of inflammatory cytokines and tissue factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>] and shedding of the IL-6 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. As a result, the CRP response to tissue injury may worsen tissue damage in some settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55783889\"><span class=\"h3\">Roles of other proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like CRP, other APR have a wide variety of functional effects, including initiating or sustaining inflammation, antiinflammatory effects, and effects upon wound healing, as well as other functional consequences. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SAA proteins, a major human acute phase protein family, are apolipoproteins that are rapidly associated with high-density lipoprotein following their synthesis and secretion and can influence cholesterol metabolism during inflammatory states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. SAA may increase the adhesion and chemotaxis of phagocytic cells and lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. However, in some patients with chronic inflammation, the net effect of increased SAA production is deleterious, because of the tissue deposition of SAA fragments and development of systemic amyloidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-aa-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement components serve proinflammatory roles, including chemotaxis, plasma protein exudation at sites of inflammation, and opsonization of infectious agents and damaged cells.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;, section on 'Hepcidin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrinogen and haptoglobin influence wound healing. Fibrinogen causes endothelial cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation, which are critical to tissue repair; and haptoglobin aids in wound repair by stimulating angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The measurement of serum acute phase reactant (APR) levels is useful because abnormalities generally reflect the presence and intensity of an inflammatory process. However, APR measurements in clinical use are not specific to any particular disease, nor can they distinguish infection from other causes of acute and chronic inflammation. The most widely used indicators of the acute phase response are the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Erythrocyte sedimentation rate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'C-reactive protein'</a> below). Other markers, such as procalcitonin, may prove to have a greater capacity than other APR to distinguish infection from malignant neoplasia or noninfectious inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Discrepancies between APR levels'</a> below.)</p><p>In certain circumstances the results of ESR and CRP determinations may be discrepant, sometimes strikingly so. This can occur due to factors related to the inflammatory process, including differences between APR in their sensitivity to change due to the composition of elements involved in a particular inflammatory and immune response. However, discrepancies between the ESR and another APR can also result from factors that may increase or reduce the ESR but are unrelated to acute or chronic inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Discrepancies between APR levels'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Erythrocyte sedimentation rate'</a> below.)</p><p>Serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations usually parallel those of CRP. Although some studies suggest that SAA is a more sensitive marker of inflammatory disease, assays for SAA are not widely available for use in routine clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythrocyte sedimentation rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ESR, defined as the rate (expressed in <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span> at which erythrocytes suspended in plasma settle when placed in a vertical tube, is an indirect measure of the acute phase response and of levels of APR, particularly fibrinogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It can be influenced by other constituents of the blood, such as immunoglobulins, as well. The ESR can also be affected by changes that may be unrelated to inflammation, including changes in erythrocyte size, shape, and number; and by other technical factors. (See <a href=\"#H58563664\" class=\"local\">'Increased ESR'</a> below and <a href=\"#H58564159\" class=\"local\">'Decreased ESR'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58563664\"><span class=\"h3\">Increased ESR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ESR, like other APR, is increased in patients with active inflammation from most causes. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic and localized inflammatory and infectious diseases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant neoplasms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">injury/ischemia</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma</p><p/><p>Marked elevations in the ESR are more often due to infection than other causes, but noninfectious disorders are also a common etiology. In a retrospective study of 1006 consecutive outpatients, ESR values of over 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> were most commonly due to infection (33 percent), with malignant neoplasms and renal disease responsible for 17 percent each and inflammatory disorders responsible for 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Conditions or factors unrelated to acute or chronic inflammation that may also increase the ESR include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased age and female sex &ndash; ESR values increase markedly with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] and are slightly higher among women than men. As a result, any single set of normal values will not be valid for the population at large. One can roughly correct ESR for age by using the following formulas: the upper limit of the reference range equals (age in <span class=\"nowrap\">years)/2</span> for men and (age in years + <span class=\"nowrap\">10)/2</span> for women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia &ndash; It has long been known that anemia increases the sedimentation rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The sedimentation of red blood cells is presumably impeded by other red blood cells; sedimentation is thus more rapid in anemia, in which this retardation is lessened, thus increasing the ESR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal disease &ndash; The ESR is elevated (greater than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> by the Westergren method) in almost all patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or the nephrotic syndrome and is unaffected by hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. Nearly 60 percent of patients with ESRD have an ESR above 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour,</span> while 20 percent have extreme elevations above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span>. Thus, an isolated ESR elevation in a patient with renal disease, without other systemic signs or symptoms, does not necessarily indicate the presence of infection, disease activity, or an underlying malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one study of patients with glomerular disease, a positive correlation between the degree of proteinuria and the ESR was observed, with the ESR being found to be about 10 times the daily rate of protein excretion in patients who had not been treated with immunosuppressive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The precise mechanism by which this occurs is not known, although an underlying inflammatory renal disease process may cause both an elevated ESR and result in proteinuria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity &ndash; Both ESR and CRP can be elevated in obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]; this is due at least in part to interleukin (IL)-6 secretion by adipose tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical factors &ndash; Tilting of the ESR tube or high room temperature may increase the ESR.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58564159\"><span class=\"h3\">Decreased ESR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors may spuriously result in a very low ESR or ESR that is less than the expected level in a patient with acute or chronic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].

Very small changes in CRP levels, detected with highly-sensitive assays, may also occur in association with metabolic stresses in the absence of acute or chronic inflammatory states as they have traditionally been viewed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85778911\"><span class=\"h3\">'Normal' CRP levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The level of CRP that is truly normal or clinically innocuous is not known. Data from a study conducted by the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey of over 21,000 people in the United States revealed that CRP levels vary with age, sex, and race, with slightly higher levels seen with increased age, with female sex, and in African Americans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F59376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59376 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. A rough correction of the CRP for age can be made by using the following formulas: the upper limit of the reference range <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/dL)</span> equals (age in <span class=\"nowrap\">years)/50</span> for men and (age in <span class=\"nowrap\">years/50)</span> + 0.6 for women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>It is very important to note that there is no uniformity in the units that are used to report CRP levels. Some laboratories report CRP concentrations as <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> while others employ <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>. Standard CRP determinations may be reported either in units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or in units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> while determinations using a highly sensitive assay, generally referred to as &quot;high-sensitivity CRP&quot; (hs-CRP), are routinely reported in units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'High-sensitivity CRP and low-grade inflammation'</a> below.)</p><p>Population studies reveal a skewed, rather than Gaussian, distribution of plasma CRP concentrations. About 70 to 90 percent of samples from reference populations have CRP concentrations under 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L),</span> but some individuals have minor elevations up to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span>. What we commonly call normal ranges (properly called reference ranges) for CRP vary greatly from one laboratory to another, to a degree that cannot be explained on a biologic or technical basis. What is thus regarded as &quot;elevated&quot; is often misleading. It would be best to regard CRP concentrations &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> as indicating clinically significant inflammation while concentrations between 0.3 and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> indicate what is commonly referred to as low-grade inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Low-grade inflammation is not accompanied by the classic signs of inflammation and may result from an immense number of metabolic stresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>]. Some of these stresses are clinically apparent; examples include atherosclerosis, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, insulin resistance, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Low-grade inflammation is, however, also associated with an astounding number of conditions and lifestyles known to be associated with poor health, including low levels of physical activity, prehypertension, a large variety of unhealthy diets, social isolation, and even being unmarried [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85778917\"><span class=\"h3\">Moderate to marked elevation of CRP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most inflammatory conditions, the CRP, like the ESR, becomes elevated as part of the acute phase response. Markedly elevated levels of CRP are strongly associated with infection. Infections, most often bacterial, were found in approximately 80 percent of patients with values in excess of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> and in 88 to 94 percent of patients with values over 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Levels of CRP may also be elevated in patients with viral infections, although usually not to the degree seen in patients with bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Procalcitonin and CRP'</a>.)</p><p>ESR and CRP levels may be discrepant due to differences in kinetics, with the CRP both rising and decreasing more rapidly; or related to characteristics of the inflammatory or and immune-disease related mechanisms, as in systemic lupus, where significant CRP elevations are typically not as common or to as great a degree as are increases in the ESR. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Discrepancies between APR levels'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">High-sensitivity CRP and low-grade inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some confusion has arisen because of widespread use of the terms &quot;high-sensitivity CRP&quot; and &quot;low-grade inflammation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. One common misunderstanding has been the incorrect belief that hs-CRP is different in some way from the CRP that has been measured for many years. It is not. &quot;High-sensitivity&quot; only means that the concentration of CRP was determined using an assay designed to measure and distinguish very low levels of CRP. The CRP that is measured has no new or unique properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Minor CRP elevation (concentrations between 3 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> has been generally regarded as a marker of what has been called low-grade inflammation. However, this poorly defined state, sometimes referred to as mini-inflammation or subclinical inflammation, occurs in many conditions in which there are minor degrees of metabolic dysfunction, such as obesity and insulin resistance, unlike inflammation as it has traditionally been understood (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'C-reactive protein'</a> above). Moreover, the low-grade inflammatory state differs in several important ways from the acute inflammation that occurs in response to infection or tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/74,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,76</a>]. The acute inflammatory state is associated with the classic signs of inflammation (swelling, erythema, warmth, and pain), while low-grade inflammation is not. Acute inflammation generally shows a marked CRP response while low-grade inflammation shows only minor CRP elevation. The inflammatory response to infection and tissue injury supports host defense, clearance of necrotic tissue, adaptation, and repair, while the purpose of low-grade inflammation appears to be restoration of metabolic homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>The factors that trigger the acute inflammatory response and low-grade inflammation differ as well. Acute inflammation is largely triggered by components of an invading pathogen, referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and by products of damaged cells, damage- (or danger-) associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The latter are sometimes referred to as alarmins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. One molecular mechanism that can trigger low-grade inflammation and CRP induction in response to metabolic stress that has been well-studied is the unfolded protein response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>These differences between acute inflammation and low-grade inflammation are so great that two leading researchers in the field have suggested distinct nomenclatures for the latter; both &quot;para-inflammation&quot; and &quot;metaflammation&quot; (metabolically-triggered inflammation) have been proposed to emphasize the distinction between metabolic perturbation and inflammation as it is traditionally viewed, both of which may result in increases in CRP levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/76,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Discrepancies between APR levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although elevations in multiple components of APR commonly occur together, not all happen uniformly in all patients. Discordance between concentrations of different APR is common; some may be elevated while others are not. Differences in the production of specific cytokines or their modulators in different diseases may account in large part for these variations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additionally, as a patient&rsquo;s condition worsens or improves, the ESR changes relatively slowly, while CRP concentrations can change rapidly.</p><p>Discrepancies between ESR and CRP are found with some frequency. An elevated ESR observed together with a normal CRP is often a misleading result that may, for example, reflect the effects of blood constituents, such as monoclonal immunoglobulins, that are not related to inflammation but that can influence the ESR. It should not be routine practice to order serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) in such instances, unless the clinical presentation suggests that a plasma cell dyscrasia may be present.</p><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) represents an exception to the generalization that CRP concentrations correlate with the extent and severity of inflammation in patients with rheumatic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]; the ESR may be elevated, sometimes markedly, in patients with active SLE, while the CRP response is muted. The muted CRP response in SLE appears to result from the ability of type I interferons, which are highly expressed in most lupus patients, to inhibit CRP induction in hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. While many patients with active SLE do not have elevated CRP concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], CRP concentrations may be quite elevated in patients with active lupus serositis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>] or with chronic synovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. In a febrile lupus patient, marked CRP elevation (greater than 6 or 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> favors the diagnosis of bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In a landmark study, infection was present in all patients with CRP levels over 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> except for those with serositis, supporting the clinical utility of regarding marked CRP elevation as strongly suggestive of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, the ESR and CRP generally tend to both be elevated or not in the same patients. However, one study found that results for the two tests were discordant (ESR &gt;28 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hr</span> with CRP &le;0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or ESR &le;28 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hr</span> with CRP &gt;0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> in about one-quarter of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in a large practice-based registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>Several studies have suggested that elevations of the acute phase protein, procalcitonin, are highly specific for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>]; thus, procalcitonin may prove useful in differentiating infections from other inflammatory stimuli in autoimmune disease patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-91</a>]. A 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis of nine observational studies that evaluated procalcitonin as a marker of infection in patients with autoimmune disease found that procalcitonin and CRP exhibited similar sensitivity for infection (75 versus 77 percent), but that procalcitonin had significantly higher specificity (90 versus 56 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Thus, procalcitonin determination was inadequate to exclude infection. Further study is required to define its clinical utility in patients with systemic autoimmune disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Procalcitonin and CRP'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bronchitis-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bronchitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Procalcitonin'</a>.)</p><p>Since there are undoubtedly a number of other clinical situations in which similar discrepancies occur, there probably is no single best laboratory test to reflect inflammation. The optimal use of acute phase protein measurements may be to obtain several measurements, usually ESR and CRP, rather than a single test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The results must be interpreted in light of the clinical context and the considerations previously indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment of acute phase reactants (APR) may be helpful in a range of disorders, where such testing may be useful for diagnosis, monitoring of disease activity, or as a prognostic marker, depending upon the condition.

The following examples are conditions in which measurement of APR may be particularly helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis &ndash; APR are helpful in monitoring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis. Generally, both the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) respond to changes in disease activity and may be sensitive indicators. However, in one study, nearly 60 percent of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis had both ESR &lt;28 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/h</span> and CRP &lt;0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> thereby limiting the utility of these acute phase reactants for monitoring disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

In older adults, elevated levels of APR predict &quot;failure to thrive&quot; and even increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. This may be because a minor acute phase response reflects the presence of some degree of ongoing metabolic perturbation which itself may contribute to a poor outcome. Alternatively, these minimally elevated acute phase protein levels may merely identify individuals who are biologically older and who have sustained a greater load of minor body insults and damage, such as would result from the cumulative effect of metabolic stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-phase-reactants/abstract/74,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,94</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A change in the concentration of acute phase reactants (APR), defined as those proteins whose serum concentrations increase or decrease by at least 25 percent during inflammatory states, is a major pathophysiologic phenomenon that accompanies acute and chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Those proteins whose concentrations increase are commonly referred to as positive APR, while those whose concentrations decrease are regarded as negative APR. These changes are presumed to contribute to defensive or adaptive capabilities. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H56057153\" class=\"local\">'Definition and regulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in levels of APR result largely from the effects of cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interferon gamma. These proteins influence acute phase protein production in hepatocytes, with IL-6 being the major inducer of most APR. (See <a href=\"#H56057153\" class=\"local\">'Definition and regulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assumption that APR are beneficial is based upon the known functions of the involved proteins and speculation as to how they may serve useful purposes in inflammation, healing, or adaptation to noxious stimuli. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a component of the innate immune response, and has both proinflammatory and antiinflammatory actions. A number of other APR can initiate or sustain inflammation, while some APR may be antiinflammatory. (See <a href=\"#H56057160\" class=\"local\">'Function'</a> above and <a href=\"#H55783368\" class=\"local\">'Roles of CRP'</a> above and <a href=\"#H55783889\" class=\"local\">'Roles of other proteins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), defined as the rate <span class=\"nowrap\">(mm/hour)</span> at which erythrocytes suspended in plasma settle when placed in a vertical tube, reflects a variety of factors, most notably the plasma concentration of fibrinogen. Other constituents of the blood, such as immunoglobulins, can influence it as well. The ESR can also be affected by changes that may be unrelated to inflammation, including changes in erythrocyte size, shape, and number; and by other technical factors. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Erythrocyte sedimentation rate'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58563664\" class=\"local\">'Increased ESR'</a> above and <a href=\"#H58564159\" class=\"local\">'Decreased ESR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The level of CRP that is truly normal or clinically innocuous is not known. CRP levels vary somewhat with age, sex, and race. There is no uniformity in the units that are used to report CRP levels; some laboratories report CRP concentrations as <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> while others employ <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>. Markedly elevated levels are strongly associated with infection. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'C-reactive protein'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although CRP is a sensitive indicator of inflammation, it is not specific for our traditional concept of inflammation (tumor, calor, rubor, and dolor), especially at relatively low levels. Values between 0.3 and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> may reflect minor degrees of inflammation, such as that seen in periodontitis, but may also reflect low-grade inflammatory states in conditions in which there are minor degrees of metabolic dysfunction, such as obesity and insulin resistance. Values greater than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> are considered to reflect clinically significant inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'C-reactive protein'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'High-sensitivity CRP and low-grade inflammation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although elevations in multiple components of the APR typically happen together, not all occur uniformly in all patients.
