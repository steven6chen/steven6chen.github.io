The wide range reflects differences in populations, age groups, methods of ascertainment, and case definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The prevalence of congenital cataract in developed countries is 1 to 3 per 10,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The crystalline lens consists of five major structures: embryonic nucleus, fetal nucleus, cortex, lens epithelium, and lens capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The crystalline lens focuses light rays onto the retina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Relaxation or contraction of the ciliary body changes the shape of the lens to permit focus of light rays from objects at distant and near fixation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59910 \">figure 1</a>).

They are frequently familial. Congenital anterior polar cataracts generally are associated with a good visual prognosis, but may be progressive and should be followed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. If congenital anterior polar cataract is unilateral, it is frequently associated with anisometropia, which can be severe and cause amblyopia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Persistent fetal vasculature</strong> &ndash; Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV, formerly called persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous [PHPV]) is an arrest of embryonic development. The eye is mildly microphthalmic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75788\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75788 \">picture 3</a>), and a vascularized stalk extends from the optic nerve to the posterior aspect of the crystalline lens, causing a posterior lens plaque that can obstruct the visual axis. PFV may result in cataract formation, elongation of the ciliary processes, and glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cataract surgery in children with PFV often is complicated.

The progression may take months to years; slow progression is usually associated with good visual prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posterior subcapsular cataracts</strong> &ndash; Posterior subcapsular cataracts involve the area immediately anterior to the posterior capsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70532\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70532 \">figure 2</a>). They are acquired, in many cases, secondary to glucocorticoid therapy or ionizing radiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Total cataracts</strong> &ndash; Total (complete or diffuse) cataracts involve the complete crystalline lens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76110\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76110 \">picture 1</a>) and preclude any view of the retina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Zonular cataracts</strong> &ndash; Zonular cataracts involve a particular zone of the developing lens (nuclear, lamellar, sutural, or cortical) and reflect an insult occurring at a particular time during lens development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Nuclear cataracts occur early in gestation, whereas lamellar cataracts occur in childhood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nuclear cataracts involve the embryonal or fetal nucleus and are highly amblyogenic. They usually are bilateral and can represent an intrauterine insult and often are associated with microphthalmos (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80566\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80566 \">picture 5</a>). Bilateral cases may be associated with autosomal dominant inheritance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lamellar cataracts involve the lamella peripheral to the Y sutures of the lens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sutural cataracts involve the Y sutures of the lens, they can be unilateral or bilateral, and inheritance is X-linked or autosomal recessive.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-third of congenital cataracts in children are inherited, one-third are associated with systemic diseases, and one-third are idiopathic or sporadic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hereditary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary cataracts are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with almost complete penetrance but variable expressivity.

Penetrating trauma with disruption of the lens capsule allows hydration of the lens cortex, which results in cataract; these cortical changes may remain focal (if small) or progress rapidly (within a period of hours) to total cortical opacification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The possibility of non-accidental injury should be considered in cases of total or complete cataracts where the etiology is unclear.

In young children (&lt;6 to 9 months) or in patients with small eyes, an aphakic contact lens is used. When the natural lens is removed in older children, it is usually replaced with an IOL. In addition, bifocal glasses are required for near work because the IOL or contact lens does not accommodate and is typically powered for distance.</p><p>After bilateral cataract extraction, aphakic spectacles occasionally may be used to restore focus. However, as techniques for IOL implantation have improved, aphakic spectacles have become less popular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In addition, aphakic spectacles are less cosmetically appealing than standard glasses because the high power of correction requires a thicker diameter lens.</p><p>The age of the patient at the time of surgery is an important factor in determining the best form of optical rehabilitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Young infants (&lt;6 months)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many ophthalmologists prefer aphakic contact lenses to IOL implantation for optical rehabilitation in infants &lt;6 months at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/2,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,35</a>]. In this age group, the risk of postoperative complications, such as intraocular inflammation and secondary membrane formation, is lower in children with aphakic contact lenses than in those who undergo primary IOL implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>In the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS), a multicenter randomized trial that compared IOL and contact lens correction for monocular aphakia in 114 infants between one and six months of age, visual acuity outcomes were similar at 1 and 4.5 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. However, the rate of adverse events was lower in the contact lens group (56 versus 81 percent at five years of age) and fewer patients in the contact lens group required additional intraocular procedures (21 verus 72 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The rates of glaucoma or suspected glaucoma were similar at five years of age, but ongoing follow-up is necessary to determine whether the risk of glaucoma is affected by the initial surgical treatment.

The total refractive power of the aphakic eye decreases from +30.75 at birth to +26.36 at one year, +23.00 at two years, and +21.20 at three years. The provision of a clear retinal image (ie, emmetropia) would require a +30 diopter IOL at birth and a +21 diopter IOL at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Infants who are initially rehabilitated with aphakic contact lenses may undergo secondary IOL implantation later in life if contact lenses become more difficult to manage (usually at &ge;2 to 3 years of age).</p><p>Disadvantages to the use of aphakic contact lenses include the need for daily maintenance, risk of corneal infections in association with contact lens wear, and delayed amblyopia therapy with contact lens loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, there are costs to the patient associated with frequent replacement of contact lenses due either to lens loss or the need to change lens power. In a retrospective cost analysis of the IATS study, while the overall five-year treatment costs were higher with an IOL compared with aphakic contact lenses (USD $27,090 versus $25,331), patient costs were more than double with contact lenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Older infants and children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children &gt;6 months, it is generally accepted that IOL implantation (pseudophakia) offers the best opportunity for visual rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Advantages of IOL implantation include immediate and full-time optical correction (in contrast to contact lenses which require regular insertion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], which greatly aids amblyopia management.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-third of cataracts in children are inherited, one-third are associated with other disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78696\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78696 \">table 2</a>), and one-third are idiopathic or sporadic. Acquired cataracts may be caused by ocular trauma, glucocorticoids, and ionizing radiation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important aspects of the clinical presentation of cataract include an asymmetric red reflex, leukocoria, photophobia, strabismus, nystagmus, and decreased visual acuity. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Examination'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Visual development and vision assessment in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of an infant or child with a cataract focuses on determining the etiology. Identification of associated disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78696\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78696 \">table 2</a>) may have implications for therapy and monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation for patients in whom the etiology of cataract is uncertain after history and physical examination may include evaluation for galactosemia and other metabolic diseases, intrauterine infection, and or genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for referral to an ophthalmologist include suspicion of cataract, family history of hereditary cataract, long-term systemic glucocorticoid use, history of ionizing radiation exposure (eg, radiation therapy), and systemic disorders associated with cataracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78696\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78696 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Referral indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Management and outcome</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of cataracts depends upon the age of the child and potential for interference with visual development. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend cataract extraction for newborns with bilateral complete cataracts (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Surgery should take place as soon as possible, ideally within the first four to six weeks of life. The two eyes should be operated on within one week of each other. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Cataract extraction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with incomplete cataracts (unilateral or bilateral), we suggest surgery if any of the following features are present (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Cataract extraction'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased visual response</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduced visual acuity <span class=\"nowrap\">(20/50</span> level or worse)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Opacity &gt;3 mm in diameter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Onset of strabismus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nystagmus, which indicate disruption in fusion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the natural lens is removed, it must be replaced with an intraocular lens (IOL) or an aphakic contact lens. In addition, bifocal glasses are required for near work. Aphakic contact lenses are usually used for infants &lt;6 months of age at the time of surgery; an IOL is usually used for older infants and children. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Optical and visual rehabilitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative complications may include opacification of the posterior capsule (if posterior <span class=\"nowrap\">capsulectomy/anterior</span> vitrectomy is not performed at the time of cataract extraction), glaucoma, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis. Children who develop sudden vision loss, ocular pain, or ocular redness any time after cataract surgery should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular ophthalmology follow-up is crucial for successful outcome in children who have undergone cataract surgery (with or without IOL implantation). (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cataract-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Foster A, Gilbert C, Rahi J.
