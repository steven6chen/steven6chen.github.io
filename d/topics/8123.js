Hepatic hydrothorax occurs in approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients with cirrhosis. In a retrospective analysis of 495 patients with cirrhosis and pleural effusion, 16 percent had hepatic hydrothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While patients with ascites can often tolerate up to 5 to 10 L of fluid with only mild symptoms, those with a pleural effusion can have severe symptoms (such as shortness of breath, cough, and hypoxemia) with as little as 500 mL of fluid.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of hepatic hydrothorax. Other complications of cirrhosis, including ascites and variceal hemorrhage, are discussed elsewhere.

These defects are typically less than 1 cm (and may be microscopic) and are generally located in the tendinous portion of the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. Hepatic hydrothorax becomes apparent when the absorptive capacity of the pleural space is exceeded. The pathologic mechanisms behind the formation of ascites are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diaphragmatic defects are more often found in the right hemidiaphragm, likely due in part to the fact that the left hemidiaphragm is thicker and more muscular. Hepatic hydrothorax develops on the right side in approximately 73 to 85 percent of patients, on the left side in approximately 13 to 17 percent, and bilaterally in approximately 2 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>].</p><p>The negative intrathoracic pressure generated during inspiration promotes the passage of fluid from the abdominal cavity to the pleural space. This could explain why some patients with hepatic hydrothorax do not have apparent ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. This theory is supported by studies using 99mTc-human albumin or 99mTc-sulphur colloid, which demonstrate unidirectional passage of these markers from the abdominal cavity to the pleural cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/12,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15-19</a>].</p><p>Similar to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with ascites, patients with hepatic hydrothorax may develop spontaneous bacterial empyema. It is thought to occur due to seeding of the pleural effusion with bacteria that spread directly from the abdominal cavity in a patient with SBP or from bacteremia. The etiologic agents in most cases are <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Streptococcus</em> species, <em>Enterococcus</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em>, or <em>Pseudomonas</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Approximately one-half of episodes are associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common clinical manifestations in patients with hepatic hydrothorax include dyspnea, a non-productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and fatigue due to hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/1-3,10,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,10,22,23</a>]. Patients often have signs of ascites (eg, abdominal distension) as well as other findings associated with cirrhosis (eg, palmar erythema). Rarely, a pleural effusion may be an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p>Less common presentations include an acute tension hydrothorax with associated severe dyspnea and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] or spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBEM). SBEM has been described in 13 to 16 percent of patients with hepatic hydrothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>]. Infection should be suspected in a patient with hepatic hydrothorax who develops fever, new or worsening pleuritic chest pain, encephalopathy, or an unexplained worsening of renal function. (See <a href=\"#H147946602\" class=\"local\">'Thoracentesis and fluid testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of hepatic hydrothorax includes documentation of a pleural effusion and exclusion of alternative causes for the effusion. A pleural effusion can usually be demonstrated on a frontal chest radiograph, although lateral views may be required if the effusion is small. Pleural effusions in patients with hepatic hydrothorax are typically found in the right hemithorax, though they may be left-sided or bilateral. A thoracentesis as well as additional imaging (eg, a chest computed tomographic scan and echocardiogram) should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude infection or an alternate cause of a pleural effusion. Up to 20 percent of patients will have evidence of infection or a cause of pleural effusion other than hepatic hydrothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-a-pleural-effusion-in-adults-initial-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of a pleural effusion in adults: Initial testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147946602\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracentesis and fluid testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with suspected hepatic hydrothorax should undergo thoracentesis with testing of the pleural fluid.

For instance, total protein and albumin may be slightly higher in hepatic hydrothorax compared with levels in the ascitic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>As an example of pleural fluid findings in patients with hepatic hydrothorax, a retrospective study of 41 patients with hepatic hydrothorax found that 33 patients had solitary hydrothorax, and of these, 31 (94 percent) were transudative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Sixteen (48 percent) had a total protein level &lt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in the pleural fluid, none had a serum albumin value &lt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> and microbiologic cultures were negative in 31 patients.

However, we generally recommend that patients also undergo a computed tomographic scan of the chest to exclude mediastinal, pulmonary, or pleural lesions. An abdominal ultrasound with Doppler study should be performed to examine the liver, rule out liver masses, ascertain the patency of the portal and hepatic veins, and detect ascites. Finally, echocardiography should be performed to rule out a cardiac cause for the pleural effusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pleural-effusions-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pleural effusions in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-pleural-effusion-in-adults-additional-tests-for-undetermined-etiology#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of pleural effusion in adults: Additional tests for undetermined etiology&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, an intraperitoneal injection of 99mTc-sulphur colloid or 99mTc-human serum albumin can be helpful. The radioisotopes migrate from the peritoneal cavity into the pleural space, therefore establishing a communication between both spaces and confirming the diagnosis of hepatic hydrothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64287\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64287 \">image 1</a>). The optimal time to do an isotope study is shortly after therapeutic thoracentesis, when fluid is reaccumulating in the pleural cavity. When the chest is maximally filled with fluid, there may be minimal transfer of the isotope across the diaphragm, resulting in a false-negative study. Failure of the marker to show up in the pleural space (when the study has been performed shortly after thoracentesis) indicates an alternate cause of the pleural effusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147946754\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of pleural effusions is broad and includes cardiopulmonary disease, chylothorax, tuberculosis, malignant effusions, and hemothorax (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50027 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74757\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74757 \">table 3</a>). Differentiating among the causes should take into account the patient's history, fluid analysis from a thoracentesis, and imaging test results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-a-pleural-effusion-in-adults-initial-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of a pleural effusion in adults: Initial testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Factors that suggest hepatic hydrothorax as the diagnosis include a history of cirrhosis (required), a transudative effusion, a right-sided effusion, and the simultaneous presence of ascites. However, even in the appropriate clinical setting, alternative diagnoses need to be excluded prior to making a diagnosis of hepatic hydrothorax. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of hepatic hydrothorax is similar to the treatment of ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients who are actively consuming alcohol should be encouraged to abstain completely. Even if alcohol is not the only cause of their liver disease (eg, in patients with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C), the alcohol-related component of their liver disease may improve dramatically with abstinence. Management then includes dietary sodium restriction and diuretics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80148\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80148 \">algorithm 1</a>). In addition, patients with confirmed hepatic hydrothorax should be referred for liver transplantation if they are otherwise suitable candidates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ascites in adults with cirrhosis: Initial therapy&quot;, section on 'Alcohol abstinence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-patient-selection-and-pretransplantation-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are severely symptomatic should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis followed by management with a sodium restricted diet (&lt;88 mEq or 2000 mg daily) and diuretics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> 40 mg and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> 100 mg daily to start). Patients who are mildly to moderately symptomatic can be treated initially with sodium restriction and diuretics. Management options for patients who are refractory to sodium restriction and diuretics include serial thoracenteses, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, pleurodesis, thoracoscopic surgery to repair diaphragmatic defects, and liver transplantation.</p><p>Chest tubes should <strong>not</strong> be placed for the treatment of hepatic hydrothorax (though they may be needed for patients with spontaneous bacterial empyema and frank pus, or in patients undergoing pleurodesis). Placement of chest tubes in patients with hepatic hydrothorax can result in massive protein and electrolyte depletion, infection, renal failure, and bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. A review of cases of from a tertiary care center over a 10-year period indicated that 16 out of 17 patients analyzed developed serious complications following chest tube placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These complications included acute kidney injury, pneumothorax, and empyema. Furthermore, once inserted, it may be impossible to remove the tube because of the continuous reaccumulation of fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Other complications include subcutaneous emphysema; lung, spleen, liver, and stomach lacerations; hemothorax resulting from intercostal artery laceration; unilateral pulmonary edema from rapid removal of fluid; and placement of the tube into the abdominal cavity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Sodium restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Education about the importance of dietary sodium restriction is a central component of the management of hepatic hydrothorax. Patients should be advised to consume no more than 88 mEq (2000 mg) of sodium per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51602 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63387 \">table 4</a>). This level of sodium restriction can be achieved in an outpatient setting without the purchase of special foods and is the most practical and successful approach sodium restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>]. Patients should also be instructed to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which can cause sodium retention and renal failure.

If there is no response, the doses of the diuretics may be increased in a stepwise fashion every three to five days by doubling the doses (maintaining a ratio of 40 mg:100 mg). The maximum doses are furosemide 160 mg daily and spironolactone 400 mg daily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ascites in adults with cirrhosis: Initial therapy&quot;, section on 'Diuretic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Refractory hydrothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have persistent hydrothorax despite a sodium-restricted diet and diuretic therapy or who develop diuretic-related complications are considered to have refractory hydrothorax.

It is important to exclude noncompliance with dietary sodium restriction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diuretics prior to diagnosing refractory hydrothorax. In addition to the history, measurement of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion can be helpful for determining adherence to management recommendations.

Our approach is to start with repeated thoracenteses. However, for patients who require thoracentesis every two to three weeks, alternative treatments should be considered because these patients are at increased risk of having adverse events from repeated thoracentesis. For such patients, we typically suggest TIPS placement if their Child-Pugh score is &lt;13 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>), they are younger than 70 years of age, and they do not have hepatic encephalopathy.

After thoracentesis, diuretics should be continued to prevent reaccumulation of fluid. As a general rule, no more than 2 L of fluid should be removed because of the risk of pulmonary edema and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, this &quot;2 L rule&quot; was developed in patients with causes other than cirrhosis for their effusions; patients with cirrhosis may be able to tolerate the removal of larger volumes of fluid. The amount of fluid present prior to thoracentesis can be estimated by chest radiograph or computed tomographic scan.

However, TIPS placement is associated with serious complications including technical complications (eg, cardiac arrhythmias, traversal of the liver capsule), portosystemic encephalopathy, and TIPS stenosis. Because of the many potential risks of TIPS placement, we generally reserve it for selected patients with a Child-Pugh score &lt;13 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>), who are younger than 70 years of age, and who do not have hepatic encephalopathy.

One-year survival without liver transplantation was 41 percent. In 68 percent of patients there was complete resolution of symptoms, and in 57 percent of patients there was disappearance of effusions on x-ray. TIPS placement was successful in 15 of 20 patients with a Child-Pugh score &le;10 and in only one of eight patients with a Child-Pugh score &gt;10. In a meta-analysis of six studies that included a total of 198 patients with a mean duration of follow-up of 10 months, complete response to TIPS was seen in 56 percent (95% CI: 45-67%) and a partial response in 18 percent (95% CI: 11-24%) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was 12 percent (95% CI: 6.3-17%), and the 45-day mortality was 18 percent (95% CI: 11-24%). The mortality rate in refractory hepatic hydrothorax is comparable to those seen in patients with refractory ascites. The most important predictors of poor outcomes after TIPS in this population are older age, severe underlying liver disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated renal dysfunction. These findings indicate that TIPS in these patients should be considered early given the high morbidity and mortality in this population.</p><p>Risk factors for mortality after TIPS placement for hepatic hydrothorax include a Child-Pugh score &gt;10, a pre-TIPS Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score &gt;15, and an elevated pre-TIPS creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. In addition, a lack of response in the hydrothorax after TIPS placement is associated with an increased mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Pleurodesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemical pleurodesis is commonly used to treat patients with recurrent, symptomatic pleural effusions due to malignancy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemical-pleurodesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemical pleurodesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical experience suggests that hepatic hydrothorax is the most difficult form of nonmalignant pleural effusion to treat with chemical pleurodesis. Because of the rapid migration of fluid from the abdomen into the pleural space, it is often difficult to keep the two pleural surfaces apposed long enough for the inflammatory process to result in pleural symphysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, it is rarely performed and is typically reserved for patients for whom no other options exist.</p><p>Series of patients who have undergone pleurodesis for hepatic hydrothorax have had variable results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one of the largest series, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a> was performed in 18 patients with hepatic hydrothorax without repair of the diaphragmatic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. After three months, 44 percent of cases recurred. In addition, there were several complications including fever, chest pain, empyema, incomplete reexpansion, pneumonia, and wound infection. Overall morbidity was 57 percent and mortality was 39 percent during follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study included 15 patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-hydrothorax/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Control of symptoms and resolution of effusion was achieved in 11 (73 percent), with most patients remaining asymptomatic during a follow-up period of five months. Complications included pain around the chest tube site, low-grade fever with leukocytosis, pleurocutaneous fistula, and empyema.

The drain was intended to prevent reaccumulation of ascites while the inflammation and adhesion formation progressed. The procedure successfully prevented recurrence of hydrothorax in four patients and decreased the need for thoracentesis in the fifth patient. There were no deaths attributable to the procedure, but infections of the pleural fluid were observed in four patients.

Hepatic hydrothorax occurs in approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients with cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the exact mechanisms involved in the development of hepatic hydrothorax are incompletely understood, it probably results from the passage of ascites from the peritoneal cavity into the pleural cavity through small diaphragmatic defects. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common clinical manifestations in patients with hepatic hydrothorax include dyspnea, a non-productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and fatigue due to hypoxemia. Patients often have signs of ascites (eg, abdominal distension) as well as other findings associated with cirrhosis (eg, palmar erythema). Rarely, a pleural effusion may be an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hepatic hydrothorax includes documentation of a pleural effusion and exclusion of alternative causes for the effusion. A pleural effusion can usually be demonstrated on a frontal chest radiograph, although lateral views may be required if the effusion is small. Pleural effusions in patients with hepatic hydrothorax are typically found in the right hemithorax, though they may be left-sided or bilateral. A thoracentesis as well as additional imaging (eg, a chest computed tomographic scan and echocardiogram) should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude infection or an alternate cause of the effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50027 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74757\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74757 \">table 3</a>).

If there is no response, the doses of the diuretics may be increased in a stepwise fashion every three to five days by doubling the doses (maintaining a ratio of 40 mg:100 mg). The maximum doses are furosemide 160 mg daily and spironolactone 400 mg daily.

Our approach is to start with repeated thoracenteses. However, for patients who require thoracentesis every two to three weeks, alternative treatments should be considered because these patients are at increased risk of having adverse events from repeated thoracentesis. For such patients, we typically pursue TIPS placement if their Child-Pugh score is &lt;13 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-child-pugh-classification-for-severity-of-liver-disease-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>), they are younger than 70 years of age, and they do not have hepatic encephalopathy.
