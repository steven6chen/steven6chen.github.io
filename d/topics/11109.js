Deviations from normal head growth may be the first indication of an underlying congenital, genetic, or acquired problem. Many genetic conditions are associated with an abnormal pattern of head growth; the earlier these conditions are detected, the earlier appropriate treatment, services, and genetic counseling can be provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A clinical genetics approach to microcephaly in infants and children will be presented here. At the heart of this approach is an attempt in each case to formulate an etiological diagnosis that gives at least an indication of the sibling recurrence risk. The etiology and primary care evaluation of microcephaly in infants and children and microcephaly related to Zika virus are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microcephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microcephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zika-virus-infection-an-overview#H830495117\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zika virus infection: An overview&quot;, section on 'Children'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H838952\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of microcephaly is not standardized. It is sometimes defined as an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) more than 3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for a given age, sex, and gestation. Other times, it is defined as an OFC more than 2 SD below the appropriate mean (ie, less than the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile).</p><p>OFC measurements at birth are necessary to establish a diagnosis of primary microcephaly (see <a href=\"#H6091553\" class=\"local\">'Primary microcephaly and its syndromes'</a> below). It can be difficult to measure OFC accurately in children with severe microcephaly without the landmark of the occiput. It is important to record measurements rather than percentiles &ndash; as head circumference charts vary, especially up to the age of three years, and to use the most recent culturally and ethnically relevant charts to determine percentiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>If microcephaly is defined as a head size less than 3 SD below the appropriate mean, it is more likely to be associated with genetic and non-genetic disorders affecting brain development. In contrast, if microcephaly is defined as more than 2 SD below the mean, many intellectually normal individuals who have a head circumference at the low end of the population distribution will be included.</p><p>Whatever definition is employed, measurement and appropriate charting of OFC is part of the evaluation of individuals who have a developmental delay or learning disability. The results of population-based studies indicate that it is important to measure OFC in all infants when height and weight are measured, inasmuch as reduced head circumference growth in early life is associated with diminished cognitive abilities thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider#H629395580\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Role of the primary care provider&quot;, section on 'Medical evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs#H167150642\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;, section on 'Clinical evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H838959\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terminology used to describe different types of microcephaly can be confusing, and the genetic implications of particular terms must be critically considered. For example, the term &quot;secondary microcephaly&quot; is easily misconstrued as the nongenetic opposite of genetic &quot;primary microcephaly,&quot; when in fact, secondary microcephaly is merely a descriptive term that denotes genetic and nongenetic disorders in which head growth slows <strong>after</strong> birth. (See <a href=\"#H838973\" class=\"local\">'Acquired microcephaly'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H838966\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary microcephaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;primary microcephaly&quot; was originally associated with one particular autosomal recessive microcephaly phenotype (<strong>m</strong>icro<strong>c</strong>ephaly <strong>p</strong>rimary <strong>h</strong>ereditary, MCPH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89983\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89983 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Broadly, primary microcephaly is thought to result from failure to produce enough neurons. However, defective production of neurons with secondary degeneration also may occur (eg, MCPH10, caused by homozygous mutation in <em>ZNF335</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Therefore, the primary microcephaly phenotype is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Several gene loci, designated <em>MCPH1</em>, <em>MCPH2</em>, etc, have been identified, and more are yet to be discovered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6091553\" class=\"local\">'Primary microcephaly and its syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p>Classic primary microcephaly includes the following clinical features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) at birth leading to greatly reduced OFC in adulthood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relatively normal brain anatomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative absence of neurologic signs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonprogressive mild, moderate, or (less commonly) severe learning difficulties</p><p/><p>Several newly reported varieties of autosomal recessive microcephaly have been added to an expanding list of primary microcephalies and this has broadened the range of associated phenotypes beyond the original clinical description. For example, microcephaly with early onset epilepsy (MCSZ, MIM <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/613402&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWDJkSInumv9yo/ALi17z2UhR49tBt3ychN70liHLPYcm&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">#613402</a>), Amish microcephaly (MCPHA, MIM <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/607196?search=607196&highlight=607196&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWPKC0h6zLVDZwIXLDxZR01Jz4ULjxOkVtYWxIV0aCusVWFUpPFljOsFmbrw9RrQoBQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">#607196</a>), microcephaly with or without other brain malformations caused by nonsense or missense mutations, respectively (MCPH2, MIM <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/604317?search=604317&highlight=604317&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWGRQV5Dgqf2vVGTmVmb41BZz4ULjxOkVtYWxIV0aCusVS2xYFYmpJMYgxQYL1Ml72g==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">#604317</a>), and microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern, cerebellar <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> brain stem hypoplasia (MIM <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/603802?search=603802&highlight=603802&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWPAcpQM6UO//buW7cYArNY9z4ULjxOkVtYWxIV0aCusVU5vV8Mx+FWjBGLuiU1IERw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">%603802</a>) are sometimes listed under the heading primary microcephaly because they are each inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6091553\" class=\"local\">'Primary microcephaly and its syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p>Genetic complexities also bedevil orderly classification. As an example, different mutations in the Amish microcephaly gene, <em>SLC25A19</em>, result in a metabolic disorder affecting the mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate carrier with a variable phenotype ranging from early, lethal Amish microcephaly to an adult condition with normal OFC and cognition, striatal necrosis, and polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H838973\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired microcephaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;acquired microcephaly&quot; is synonymous with such terms as secondary microcephaly and postnatal microcephaly. These terms refer to the brain that had normal or near-normal size at birth and grows abnormally slowly thereafter. A possible implication is that neuronal degeneration occurs for any genetic or non-genetic reason. Conversely, it may be that dendritic complexity and hence the amount of tracts to be myelinated are reduced, noting that the human brain doubles in size in the first year of life primarily through increasing dendritic complexity and myelination. Many cases of acquired microcephaly go undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H838980\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative microcephaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Relative microcephaly&quot; is a shorthand expression that usually is used to describe the child with neurologic impairments who has reduced head circumference relative to his somatic size, or relative to the head circumferences of his (normal) parents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57067\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57067 \">figure 1</a>).

The clinical geneticist must distinguish syndromic from nonsyndromic microcephaly and collaborate with colleagues to diagnose metabolic and neurologic conditions that may cause microcephaly.</p><p>At first consultation, it is uncommon for the geneticist to make a confident diagnosis of a specific condition and additional evaluation generally is necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. The subsequent clinical and laboratory evaluation are best determined on a case-by-case basis. Factors to be considered include the onset of microcephaly, associated dysmorphism or congenital anomalies, <span class=\"nowrap\">maternal/environmental</span> factors, and progressive neurologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H838994\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive approach to history taking, including the family history, and clinical examination of the child with microcephaly are described separately.

A new head circumference reference chart for birth to adulthood was published in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For direct comparison, simultaneously plot the OFC measurements of the child, parents, and any siblings on such a chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57067\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57067 \">figure 1</a>). For most normal children, when the head sizes of the parents and the child are plotted and compared, the child's OFC lies between the SD or centile plots of both parents, just as the midparental height is a guide to the expected height of a child. Although the Weaver curve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] achieves the same goal with greater precision, it takes a little longer to complete. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microcephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microcephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Weaver curve'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H839008\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory evaluation is best determined on a case-by-case basis, bearing in mind that the objective is to formulate a diagnosis and estimate the chance of recurrence of the condition in another child. If there is a suspicion of a metabolic cause for microcephaly, appropriate referral to the metabolic service should be made at an early stage in case there is an underlying, treatable inborn error of metabolism. (See <a href=\"#H6092100\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic microcephaly'</a> below.)</p><p>Chromosome studies are important in all cases. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) studies have replaced traditional cytogenetic tests as the first-line genetic test in children with neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly when there is less severe microcephaly, malformation, or dysmorphism. Array CGH has a higher abnormality detection rate than traditional cytogenetic studies, and this increased resolution permits detection of much smaller chromosomal deletions and duplications, sometimes even at the gene and exon level (eg, homozygous microcephalin [<em>MCPH1</em>] deletions have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Traditional cytogenetic studies can detect an increased rate of abnormal, prophase-like cells suggesting primary microcephaly due to <em>MCPH1</em> mutation, but overall, this is a rare cause of primary microcephaly. (See <a href=\"#H6092642\" class=\"local\">'Array comparative genomic hybridization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H839015\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When there is a request for accurate genetic counseling, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain usually is undertaken despite the requirement for sedation or general anesthesia in very young or uncooperative individuals. Neonates can be more easily scanned when sleeping avoiding the need for anesthetics; however, more minor structural brain anomalies may be overlooked. Simultaneous magnetic resonance spectroscopy may be warranted if rare neurometabolic causes of microcephaly are suspected (eg, brain creatine deficiency syndromes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H839031\"><span class=\"h2\">Categorization after initial consultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the initial genetics assessment, most children with microcephaly can be assigned to one of the following broad clinical categories, although some patients have features of more than one category:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microcephaly (OFC -2 to -4 SD) with an undiagnosed pattern of dysmorphism &ndash; In such children it is important to rule out chromosomal defects, specific dysmorphic syndromes, and environmental factors such as prenatal alcohol exposure. For children in this category, learning difficulties rather than microcephaly is the significant finding. This category usually has a low empiric risk of recurrence, except in families where one parent is likely affected. (See <a href=\"#H6091403\" class=\"local\">'Microcephaly with dysmorphism'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary microcephaly phenotype (OFC -4 to -11 SD) &ndash; Classic cases of primary microcephaly have minimal dysmorphism and normal neurologic examination. This category generally has a high risk of recurrence because the primary microcephaly phenotype is usually due to an autosomal recessive condition. A dominant form of primary microcephaly has now been reliably described, often with little effect on learning abilities (see <a href=\"#H6092253\" class=\"local\">'Uncertain diagnosis'</a> below). Note that the phenotype is not always classic; in such cases brain MRI findings may help to identify a particular type of genetic microcephaly. (See <a href=\"#H839015\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6091553\" class=\"local\">'Primary microcephaly and its syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microcephaly with prominent neurologic abnormalities (OFC -2 to -4 SD) &ndash; This category frequently includes postnatal reduction in brain growth with spasticity, global developmental impairments, seizures including epileptic encephalopathy, and diverse brain MRI abnormalities. This category includes an admixture of recessive disorders including metabolic conditions, new dominant mutations (especially in some, but not all, cases with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy), and, occasionally, difficult to identify adverse prenatal events. The recurrence risk varies from one in four to zero, hence the importance of making a definite diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6091766\" class=\"local\">'Microcephaly with prominent neurologic abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6091395\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBSEQUENT GENETICS ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial genetic assessment may result in the patient being assigned informally to one of the broad categories described in the previous section (see <a href=\"#H839031\" class=\"local\">'Categorization after initial consultation'</a> above). Thereafter, the need for further laboratory investigations is driven by consultations with colleagues &ndash; metabolic physicians, pediatric neurologists, and neuroradiologists &ndash; and by the desire of parents to have more information on recurrence risks and options for future pregnancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6091403\"><span class=\"h2\">Microcephaly with dysmorphism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microcephaly with dysmorphism is a common scenario in the genetic clinic. The occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) at birth may be normal or mildly reduced. Subsequently, the OFC may follow a trajectory between 2 and 4 SD below the mean for age, sex, and gestational age. Decreased head circumference may be noted at the child's first presentation with developmental impairments. Developmental impairments often are global, but the severity across domains (eg, motor, language) is not necessarily uniform. Other clinical problems, such as organ malformation, visual impairments, or hearing loss can lead to an earlier presentation. The risk of recurrence depends upon the underlying diagnosis.</p><p>Genetic assessment is vital when seeking an underlying syndrome. Sometimes, a subtle pattern of dysmorphisms suggests a &quot;gestalt&quot; diagnosis (ie, a pattern that is easily recognized), such as <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/105830&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWM0JHuylowsgC8PfjSr1k20DUG3jGzn5Xjr/+dLCIBva&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Angelman syndrome</a>, <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/180849&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWFHg61LPv+qEZlOuUnYE7SkG+BMa0KH9Z/GmIwjQlwlY&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome</a>, or Cornelia de Lange syndrome types 1 through 5 (MIM <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/122470&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWC3ngIo3opE2h8t0peJCnn4rSgFQCWDoj49LYry7qKwQ&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">#122470</a>, MIM <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/300590&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWDVQUlorqpVMYqFxsvgBrWYOhx5eIK2ZWJI/OwgvTeoY&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">#300590</a>, MIM <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/610759&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWBdvDbhpkPbn6uno1qrQLDFzfF4Xhfi24H1nKvDFlLUh&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">#610759</a>, <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/614701&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWNsXNhIkP5QdNqrGt1gv7vUT8YQ5cBRvtUuLkc2eM56S&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM#614701</a>, MIM <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/300882&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWExDWz5swCad4EZC0hDLH0U0s7dtSoXU+8acvNZSsR1D&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">#300882</a>).</p><p><a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/194050&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWGuPZj/nZNWxizR6/yOCjg4p+F7zPXR5wIvMH3/COZFn&amp;TOPIC_ID=14392\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Williams syndrome</a> and Angelman syndrome are two relatively common conditions, with well-defined molecular genetic pathologies on chromosome 7 and chromosome 15, respectively, that cause mildly reduced head circumference. Such well-known syndromes increasingly act as clinical cornerstones for development of new knowledge. As an example, recognition of the clinical overlap between Rett and Angelman syndrome preceded the expanding spectrum of Angelman syndrome-like and Rett syndrome-like conditions with various combinations of severe learning difficulties, epilepsy, movement disorder or ataxia, irregular breathing, and reduced OFC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64060\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64060 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microcephaly-a-clinical-genetics-approach/abstract/26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-31</a>].

More often, however, there is no firm clinical diagnosis. Difficulties arise in cases where the clinical evidence is weak or just suggestive. In some cases, family history is crucial (eg, consanguinity, ethnic background, affected relatives). Family history should always be investigated in detail, if possible.

A present day challenge for clinicians who receive next-generation sequencing results is to foster an essential working relationship with the scientists and bioinformaticians, who analyze and filter the many DNA sequence variants each individual carries. Despite the technological advances, the clinician's skills remain essential to the whole process.
