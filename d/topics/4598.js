It can keep the brain and other organs from being damaged by lack of oxygen. It is something you do until the heart can be shocked back into action or until it becomes clear the person cannot be saved.</p><p>The instructions for doing CPR on adults are different from the instructions for doing CPR on children. This article is about doing CPR on adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2346041337\"><span class=\"h1\">What is an AED?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AED stands for &quot;automated external defibrillator.&quot; It is a device that can tell if a person's heart needs to be shocked, and then give the shock. This can sometimes get a normal heart rhythm started again.</p><p>Many public places, such as shopping malls, airports, and sports events, have AEDs available. They come with directions so anyone can use them, even without special training. AEDs can save lives, since shocking a person's heart has the best chance of working when it is done right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400959\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if a person needs CPR?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you come across an adult who is passed out, tap the person forcefully and ask, &quot;Are you OK?&quot; If the person does not respond, is not breathing, or is breathing abnormally (gasping), <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. Then start CPR.</p><p>If another person is nearby, tell them to get the AED while you start CPR. When you call for an ambulance, the person who answers the phone can tell you what to do. They will help you do CPR and tell you when you should use the AED. If you are calling with a cell phone, put the speaker on so you can have your hands free.</p><p>The person who is passed out and needs CPR is often called the &quot;victim.&quot; The person who does CPR is often called the &quot;rescuer.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400966\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I don't know how to do CPR?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can do CPR even if you have never done it before and have never been trained. All you have to do is press HARD AND FAST on the center of the victim's chest. It doesn't matter if you don't know what you are doing.</p><p>Pressing on the chest for CPR is called doing &quot;compressions.&quot; To do compressions, make sure the victim is on a flat, solid surface. Then kneel over the victim, stack your hands on top of one another with both palms facing down, and lock your fingers together. Holding your arms straight, press on the center of the victim's chest with the heel of your bottom hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73357\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73357 \">picture 1</a>). Use your body weight, rather than the strength of your arms, to press on the chest. Pushing like this squeezes the victim's heart and gets blood moving again.</p><p>Make sure the victim's chest drops down at least 2 inches under your weight with each push. Between compressions, lift all pressure off the victim's chest so that his or her chest goes back to where it was. Keep pushing hard and fast on the center of the chest. The goal is to do at least 100 to 120 compressions a minute.</p><p>Keep doing compressions until an ambulance comes or someone who is trained in healthcare takes over. If you start to get tired, ask someone else to take a turn doing compressions. Try to switch places quickly so there isn't a break. Do not worry about breathing for the victim or doing anything besides compressions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400973\"><span class=\"h1\">Does everyone do CPR the same way?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. People trained in healthcare do CPR differently than other people. People trained in healthcare check a person's pulse before starting CPR. Then they follow 3 main steps, which are easy to remember based on the letters C-A-B:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;C&quot; stands for, &quot;Do chest <strong>compressions</strong>&quot; &ndash; For this part, the rescuer does 30 compressions as described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;A&quot; stands for, &quot;Check the <strong>airway</strong>&quot; &ndash; For this part, the rescuer checks the position of the victim's head and jaw to make sure the victim can breathe. If needed, the rescuer might move the victim's head or jaw to get the airway open.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;B&quot; stands for, &quot;Do rescue <strong>breathing</strong>&quot; &ndash; For this part, the rescuer holds the victim's nose shut and forms a seal over his or her mouth. Then the rescuer breathes into the victim's mouth to get some new air &ndash; with more oxygen &ndash; into his or her lungs. The rescuer gives 2 breaths this way and then switches back and forth between compressions and rescue breathing until an ambulance comes or someone else takes over.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29400980\"><span class=\"h1\">Have the guidelines on how to do CPR changed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It used to be that all rescuers were expected to check a victim's airway and give rescue breaths if the victim was not breathing. Since 2010, people who do not know CPR are advised to do &quot;hands-only&quot; CPR, meaning they do only chest compressions and do not worry about the airway or rescue breathing.</p><p>People are sometimes afraid to do CPR, especially if they must do rescue breathing. Hands-only CPR is easier to do, and experts hope that people will be more comfortable doing it. The most important thing to do for someone whose heart has stopped is to get blood moving again. That's why compressions are so important and why it is better to do just compressions than to do nothing at all.</p><p>The American Heart Association (AHA) last updated the guidelines about how to do CPR in 2015.
