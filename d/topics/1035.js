Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) remain the mainstay of treatment for epilepsy. In addition, these agents now have numerous other indications, including the treatment of migraine headaches, bipolar disorder, and chronic pain.</p><p>Both epilepsy and AEDs are associated with adverse effects on bone health. Persons with epilepsy treated with AEDs have increased rates of bone loss and abnormalities in bone and mineral metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. These adverse effects may contribute to an increased risk of fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the association between AEDs and disorders of bone and mineral metabolism, including <span class=\"nowrap\">osteomalacia/rickets</span> and osteoporosis or low bone mass. In addition, the screening, treatment, and prevention of AED-related bone disease will be discussed.</p><p>The management of epilepsy and the pharmacology of AEDs are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiseizure drugs: Mechanism of action, pharmacology, and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">METABOLIC BONE DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first reports linking AED therapy to skeletal disease were published in the late 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Affected patients had florid bone disease with clinical, biochemical, and histologic abnormalities consistent with rickets and osteomalacia. However, these early reports included mostly institutionalized patients.</p><p>Current studies of community-dwelling, ambulatory patients with epilepsy who receive AED therapy generally describe more subtle radiographic and biochemical abnormalities, including decreased bone mineral density (BMD), abnormal vitamin D metabolism, and biochemical evidence of increased bone remodeling activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Each of these abnormalities is associated with decreased bone strength and increased risk of fractures compared with individuals who do not have epilepsy and do not take AEDs. Patients with epilepsy have an even higher risk for fracture, owing to the increased risk of falls and physical trauma associated with the seizures themselves, the neurologic disease that underlies the epilepsy (stroke, cerebral palsy), and the effects of certain AEDs that impair gait stability. Thus, the identification of individuals with epilepsy who are predisposed to fracture because of decreased bone strength is an important aspect of their management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoporosis is defined as a skeletal disorder characterized by decreased bone strength leading to an increased risk of fracture. Bone strength represents the integration of the amount of bone present (bone mass or density) and the quality of that bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although fractures are the only clinical symptom of osteoporosis, osteoporosis may be diagnosed radiographically, before fractures occur, by measuring the amount of bone present (BMD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Osteoporosis, whether manifested by low BMD or fractures, is most common in postmenopausal women and older men, in whom the effects of aging (estrogen and testosterone deficiency) cause bone to be lost more rapidly than it can be restored. This leads to deterioration of the bone microarchitecture and associated reductions in strength.</p><p>However, osteoporosis can also develop as a result of a host of underlying medical conditions and medications, in which case it is termed secondary osteoporosis. AEDs are one of the classes of medications associated with secondary osteoporosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54926\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54926 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Concomitantly occurring secondary causes of osteoporosis can increase the severity of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and older men and cause osteoporosis in young men, women, and children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of premenopausal osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fracture is the most important manifestation of osteoporosis. Several studies have reported that fracture rates are higher in patients with epilepsy than in control populations, and among patients with epilepsy, fractures are more common in postmenopausal women and older men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/4-7,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7,14-19</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 11 studies that assessed the effects of epilepsy on fracture risk, fracture was significantly increased with a relative risk (RR) of 2.2 (95% CI 1.9-2.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In another meta-analysis of five studies evaluating clinical risk factors for fracture, AED use was a significant risk factor for fracture with an RR of 2.64 (95% CI 1.82-3.82) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In a subsequent report from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, which included 1385 users of AEDs and 137,282 nonusers aged 50 to 79 years followed for a mean of 7.7 years, use of AEDs was associated with a significantly increased risk of total fractures (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) and site-specific fractures, including hip fracture (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.2) and clinical vertebral fracture (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Both the number of AEDs used in a patient (more than one AED compared with one) and type (enzyme inducing versus nonenzyme inducing) were significantly associated with fracture risk. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Effect of AED type'</a> below.)</p><p>Other factors associated with higher fracture risk in adults with epilepsy in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], studies include older age, female gender, greater severity of epilepsy, and duration of AED use. Children and young adults may also have an increased risk of fractures compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Several observations indicate that the increase in fracture rate is due to seizure-related injuries and the effects of certain AEDs that impair gait stability, rather than the adverse effects of AEDs on bone strength alone:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures are at higher risk for fracture than patients with partial seizures, suggesting that seizure-related injuries contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The observation that epilepsy was associated with an even higher RR of hip versus forearm fracture (5.3 versus 1.7) suggests a possible preponderance of falls occurring in patients unable to use their hand to break the fall, a situation that might occur during a seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/10,16,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the WHI study, there was a significant association between AED use and the risk of falls (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.5-1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a longitudinal study of balance measures and lower limb strength in 26 sibling pairs, chronic AED users had poorer balance compared with nonusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There was no difference in quadriceps muscle strength.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone mineral density</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some AEDs alter bone and mineral metabolism. Several studies have reported low BMD at multiple sites in adult patients receiving AEDs, with measurements generally ranging between 10 and 16 percent below controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/9,19,27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19,27-31</a>]. Men and women appear to be affected similarly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A meta-analysis of 12 studies measuring BMD in patients with epilepsy found an overall significant deficit of BMD in both hip and spine with mean Z-score deviations of -0.56 and -0.38, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&quot;, section on 'DXA technology'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, however, a cross-sectional study of premenopausal women found BMD to be normal despite AED monotherapy for an average of 8 to 13 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In children, reduced BMD at axial and appendicular sites has been described but not as consistently as in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/29,33-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33-42</a>]. Increasing age is associated with decreased BMD among patients using AEDs, perhaps contributing to these discrepancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/27,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30</a>]. Other potential confounders include body mass index (BMI), number and type of AEDs, and duration of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/29,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Effect of AED type'</a> below.)</p><p>Most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/33,34,41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34,41,44</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], cross-sectional studies demonstrate that duration of AED treatment is associated with the degree of BMD loss. In some prospective studies, progressive bone loss occurred over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/9,30,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,30,45</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 81 men aged 25 to 54 years, followed for 12 to 29 months, there was a 1.8 percent annualized loss of BMD by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), much higher than would be expected in men of this age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of older women followed prospectively for an average of 4.4 years, the rate of bone loss at the total hip (after adjusting for confounders) was -0.70 percent per year in 4094 non-AED users, -0.87 percent per year in 61 intermittent AED users, and -1.16 percent per year in 41 continuous AED users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p>In contrast, in the subset of AED users (84 women) in the WHI study who had BMD measured prospectively, there was no significant difference in three-year change in BMD of the hip, spine, or total body between users and nonusers of AEDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The small number of women who had BMD measured, combined with the fact that many AED users were taking hormone therapy, may have reduced the ability of the study to show an association between AED use and change in BMD. Alternatively, these observations indicate that the increase in fracture rate may be due to seizure-related injuries and the effects of certain AEDs that impair gait stability rather than the adverse effects of AEDs on bone strength alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Markers of bone turnover</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Markers of bone formation and resorption, measured in the serum and urine, may be elevated in adults with epilepsy receiving AEDs. Elevated levels have been reported during long-term AED therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/28,37,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,37,45,46</a>], and increases have been reported to occur after initiation of AED therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/28,32,37,45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32,37,45-48</a>]. Elevated bone turnover markers are considered to reflect increased bone remodeling activity, are associated with higher rates of bone loss, and are independent predictors of fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of biochemical markers of bone turnover in osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Findings in adults with epilepsy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity in adults receiving some AEDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/46,47,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47,49-51</a>]. In those studies that measured isoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase, the increase in total alkaline phosphatase activity appeared to be related to increases in the bone isoenzyme fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/32,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,52,53</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenytoin</a> has been associated with the most consistent and marked elevations of alkaline phosphatase. However, increases have also been reported with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Effect of AED type'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High serum levels of other bone formation markers. High levels of osteocalcin (or bone Gla protein) and C-terminal extension peptide of type I procollagen (PICP) have been described in persons receiving AEDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/28,37,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,37,46-48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated markers of bone resorption. Carboxyl-terminal telopeptide of human type I collagen (CTX) and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX) are also elevated in patients treated with AEDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/28,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,46-48</a>].</p><p/><p>Bone turnover markers are not useful in the diagnosis of bone disease in individual patients taking AEDs, because values overlap substantially in normal subjects and patients with osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-biochemical-markers-of-bone-turnover-in-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of biochemical markers of bone turnover in osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteomalacia and rickets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteomalacia is a disorder of bone mineralization in which the deposition of calcium and phosphate into newly formed bone matrix (osteoid) at sites of bone remodeling or periosteal or endosteal apposition is either insufficient or completely absent. On histologic examination, thickened layers of unmineralized osteoid cover a higher than normal proportion of the bone surface.</p><p>Clinically, patients with osteomalacia complain of bone pain, which is particularly prominent in the lower extremities and is exacerbated by weightbearing. They may also notice muscle weakness, particularly of the upper arms and thighs. Physical examination often reveals tenderness to pressure over the anterior tibiae, an antalgic gait, and proximal muscle weakness. Although there are many causes of osteomalacia, when osteomalacia occurs in association with AED treatment, it is generally associated with profound vitamin D deficiency. Serum calcium and phosphorous and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) may be low, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and total alkaline phosphatase activity may be elevated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteomalacia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteomalacia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rickets, a failure of or delay in mineralization of cartilage at growth plates, occurs only in children and results in profusion of disorganized, nonmineralized, degenerating cartilage and consequent widening of the epiphyseal plates with flaring or cupping and irregularity of the epiphyseal-metaphyseal junctions. If untreated, the disorder may progress to include bowing of the lower extremities. In adults, joint enlargement due to the profusion of cartilage and ultimate formation of excess bone is sometimes evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rickets-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of rickets in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, early reports of bone disease in patients with epilepsy describe osteomalacia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/8,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,55,56</a>]. However, these reports primarily included institutionalized patients, and in ambulatory, community-dwelling persons with epilepsy, osteomalacia is rarely seen today.</p><p>Biopsy studies published in the 1980s found normal osteoid seam width and mineralization rates that were consistently normal or increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. These results are inconsistent with osteomalacia and suggest that bone disease associated with AED use is a disorder of increased remodeling rather than abnormal mineralization, resulting in osteoporosis rather than osteomalacia. Similarly, while rickets has been reported in older studies of children treated with AEDs, most of the subjects were institutionalized, and the findings likely reflect the additive effects of AED and lack of sun exposure on vitamin D metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. More recent studies of ambulatory, community-dwelling children taking AEDs do not report clinical rickets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF AED TYPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between antiepileptic drug (AED) type and fracture risk remains uncertain. In a systematic review of 13 observational studies in patients with epilepsy that compared treatment with AEDs that induce, versus AEDs that do not induce, the cytochrome P450 system, five studies showed decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in users of AEDs that induce the cytochrome P450 system, whereas five studies showed no effect on BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

However, it is of particular importance to make certain that individuals receiving AEDs are vitamin D replete before initiating therapy for osteoporosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with epilepsy are at higher risk for fracture because of a higher risk for falls and physical trauma related to seizures themselves, the neurologic disease that underlies the epilepsy (stroke, cerebral palsy), and the effects of certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that impair gait stability and alter bone and mineral metabolism. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship between AED type and fracture risk remains uncertain. However, AEDs that induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>) are those most commonly implicated as affecting bone and mineral metabolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60182 \">table 2</a>). The most commonly implicated pathogenetic mechanism is via accelerated catabolism of vitamin D. In addition, there is growing evidence to suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, a cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitor, also affects bone and mineral metabolism. To date, there are limited data available on the skeletal effects of newer AEDs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Effect of AED type'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several additional mechanisms for AED-associated bone loss have been proposed, including direct effects on intestinal calcium absorption and also on osteoblasts and osteoclasts. It is likely that more than one mechanism contributes to AED-associated bone disease and that these are, to some extent, specific to the particular AED. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Effect of AED type'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with a history of prolonged use (&gt;5 years) of AEDs, especially those using enzyme-inducing AEDs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, those with other risk factors for AED-induced bone disease (high-dose, multidrug regimens; low vitamin D intake; limited sunlight exposure; chronically ill, older, or institutionalized patients; low physical activity levels; exposure to drugs that induce chronic metabolic acidosis; and concomitant therapy with other drugs that induce hepatic enzymes) or risk factors for osteoporosis, we suggest bone mineral density (BMD) testing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving AEDs, we suggest calcium and vitamin D supplementation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Although the optimal intake (diet plus supplement) has not been clearly established in this patient population, approximately 1200 mg of calcium and 800 international units of vitamin D daily are the typical doses used. However, patients receiving AEDs, particularly enzyme-inducing AEDs, may require higher doses of vitamin D. We typically measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in such patients to determine whether vitamin D intake is sufficient to maintain levels within the normal range. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Calcium and vitamin D'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D repletion'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pharmacologic treatment of osteoporosis and fracture in patients taking AEDs is the same as the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men.
