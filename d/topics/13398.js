Direct involvement of the myocardium is much less frequent, either by metastatic or primary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In two large autopsy series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>], the incidence of any cardiac involvement was 11 and 12 percent, respectively. Of these, 76 percent had pericardial involvement, and 34 percent had an effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The most common metastatic tumor involving the pericardium is lung cancer; others include breast and esophageal cancer, melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia. Although AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has been an important cause of neoplastic pericardial disease, the incidence of KS has declined dramatically since the advent of potent antiretroviral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-kaposi-sarcoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-and-vascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients#H519454363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac and vascular disease in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Pericardial disease'</a>.)</p><p>Here we will discuss the presentation and management of pericardial disease associated with malignancy. An overview of the etiology of pericardial disease, and the clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of <span class=\"nowrap\">constrictive/restrictive</span> pericardial disease related to cancer or its treatment is presented elsewhere.

At least two of these features, with or without an accompanying pericardial effusion, should be present to make the diagnosis. The chest pain is characteristically pleuritic, radiates to the trapezius ridge, and is worse in the supine position. These factors help to differentiate it from pain due to myocardial ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 4 to 7 percent of patients presenting with pericarditis without a known malignancy will have a neoplastic effusion. (See <a href=\"#H2637284155\" class=\"local\">'Previously undiagnosed malignancy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericardial effusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericardial effusion is an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, with or without associated pericarditis. While an effusion may present with recognizable clinical findings, the most common method of detection is by echocardiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In different case series of patients with pericardial effusion, malignancy accounted for 13 to 25 percent of cases, with up to 10 percent of pericardial effusions being the first manifestation of a previously unknown malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. In areas where tuberculosis is not highly prevalent, malignancy may be the most common cause of a hemorrhagic effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-pericardial-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of pericardial disease&quot;, section on 'Pericardial effusion'</a>.)</p><p>Malignancy may also be a more common cause of large symptomatic pericardial effusions. In some cases, the effusion may be the initial clinical manifestation of the malignancy. This was suggested in a review of 173 consecutive patients undergoing pericardiocentesis for symptomatic pericardial effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Symptomatic effusions were defined as those with cardiorespiratory symptoms (eg, dyspnea), signs (eg, tachycardia), echocardiographic features of right heart compromise, or if pericardiocentesis was deemed therapeutic by the clinician. A cause for the effusion was found in all but 13 patients. The most common cause was malignancy, which was found in 58 patients (33 percent), 45 of whom had known malignant disease. After exclusion of pericardial effusions in which the etiology was apparent from the history, physical examination, and simple laboratory tests (eg, trauma, uremia, postpericardiotomy, rheumatic disease, known malignancy), newly found cancer was responsible for 18 percent of the remaining 74 cases.</p><p>A pericardial effusion that arises in a patient with a known malignancy usually represents metastatic spread of the malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, other etiologies for the pericardial effusion should be considered. Patients with a history of thoracic radiation treatment can develop a radiation-induced pericarditis with a pericardial effusion. In addition, patients who are immunocompromised due to treatment of an underlying malignancy can develop infectious or autoimmune pericardial effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-pericardial-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of pericardial disease&quot;, section on 'Pericardial effusion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for breast cancer and other malignancies&quot;, section on 'Esophageal cancer'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac tamponade refers to a situation in which the pressure from an accumulating pericardial effusion approaches and then equalizes with intracardiac pressures, leading to impaired filling of one, or usually both, ventricles and decreased cardiac output. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rigid pericardium normally does not significantly affect diastolic ventricular compliance, but when fluid accumulates rapidly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in large volume, the &quot;effective&quot; compliance of all four chambers is that of the rigid pericardial sac and markedly decreased. The clinical features of tamponade usually depend upon whether the onset of fluid accumulation is acute or subacute; tamponade is usually subacute in the setting of malignancy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cardiac tamponade is generally sudden in onset, may be associated with chest pain and dyspnea, and is life-threatening if not promptly treated. With rapid introduction of even a small amount of fluid into the pericardial space, the parietal pericardium cannot &quot;stretch&quot; to accommodate the increase in volume. This results in an acute rise in pericardial pressure, which is transmitted to all cardiac chambers and limits diastolic filling. The jugular venous pressure is usually elevated (except with volume depletion), and hypotension is common due to the decline in cardiac output. The heart rate is increased in the absence of beta blockade, and heart sounds are often muted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute cardiac tamponade is a less dramatic process. Patients may be asymptomatic or complain of dyspnea, chest discomfort or fullness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> easy fatigability. The physical examination may reveal hypotension with a narrow pulse pressure, reflecting the limited stroke volume. The jugular venous pressure is typically elevated, and peripheral edema may be seen.</p><p/><p>Pulsus paradoxus, defined as an abnormally large decrease in systolic blood pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) on inspiration, is a common finding in moderate to severe tamponade, whether acute or subacute. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulsus-paradoxus-in-pericardial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Constrictive pericarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constrictive pericarditis, sometimes referred to as pericardial constriction, results from scarring and fibrosis of the visceral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parietal pericardium, which progressively restricts diastolic filling of the ventricles. Similar to cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis leads to moderately elevated cardiac filling pressures with reduced preload and stroke volumes. The clinical features overlap, but there are important differences, and the management and prognosis are different. In effusive-constrictive pericarditis, there is both pericardial scarring and a hemodynamically significant effusion. Drainage of pericardial fluid may unmask findings typical of constrictive physiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This subject is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2637284155\"><span class=\"h2\">Previously undiagnosed malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, pericardial disease is the first manifestation of malignancy, and an important clinical question is whether to pursue a search for an occult cancer. Among patients presenting with pericarditis or a small pericardial effusion without known malignancy, the likelihood of finding previously undiagnosed cancer is between 4 to 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>As an example, a prospective study evaluated 231 consecutive patients presenting with acute pericarditis or tamponade without apparent cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. All received an empiric trial of anti-inflammatory therapy, and nonresponders went on to pericardiocentesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pericardial biopsy. A specific diagnosis was established in 32 (14 percent), only 13 of whom had cancer (6 percent of the total).</p><p>Patients presenting with constrictive pericarditis also have a low likelihood of harboring an undiagnosed malignancy. In three large case series of patients with constriction, malignancy was identified in fewer than 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. However, radiation therapy, mostly for previously diagnosed Hodgkin's disease or breast cancer, was thought to be causative in 9 to 31 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, the likelihood of finding malignancy is higher in patients who present with a large pericardial effusion or tamponade:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 57 patients with a new large effusion, a specific diagnosis was established by pericardial biopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluid cytology in 93 percent; 13 (23 percent) had a previously undiagnosed malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 450 patients with acute pericardial disease, 33 (7.3 percent) had a neoplastic cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other than a prior history of malignancy, the major clinical characteristics associated with a neoplastic cause were cardiac tamponade at presentation (odds ratio [OR] 7.0, 95% CI 1.3-38.2), lack of response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and recurrent or persistent pericarditis (OR 10.0, 95% CI 3.6-27.1). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Thus, a detailed evaluation to search for occult malignancy should generally be reserved for patients who have persistent pericarditis that is unresponsive to anti-inflammatory therapy and those who present with a new large pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/10,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,18</a>].

In several single-center series of pericardiocentesis, a malignant etiology for pericardial disease was identified in up to 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/1,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19-21</a>]. In the remainder, idiopathic pericarditis was most common, while prior radiation therapy was thought to be contributory in 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].

Although AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has been an important cause of neoplastic pericardial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], the incidence of KS has declined dramatically in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy.

In addition, primary tumors can arise in the pericardium, although these are much less frequent than secondary involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Miscellaneous pericardial lesions'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with a known malignancy, the development of a symptomatic pericardial effusion is usually associated with a short median survival (two to four months from the time of detection). However, prognosis may be better in certain subsets of patients, such as those with an absence of malignant cells in the pericardium using cytologic or histologic techniques, hematologic rather than solid tumors, and breast cancer rather than lung cancer. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and status of the underlying malignancy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic approach to suspected pericardial disease may include any or all of the following: electrocardiography (ECG), radiologic imaging studies, pericardial biopsy or pericardiocentesis to obtain material for <span class=\"nowrap\">histologic/cytologic</span> analysis, and cardiac catheterization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with suspected pericardial disease should have an ECG.

PR segment elevation is often seen in lead aVR. With pericardial effusion, especially if tamponade is present, QRS voltage may be decreased, and occasionally electrical alternans is seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72525\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72525 \">waveform 2</a>). This abnormality is characterized by a cyclic beat-to-beat shift in the QRS axis associated with mechanical swinging of the heart to-and-fro, usually in a large pericardial effusion.

Pericardioscopy allows direct visualization of the pericardial space; the reported sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignancy is as high as 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/21,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,39,40</a>]. In contrast, the sensitivity for blind pericardial biopsy is lower (56 to 65 percent), presumably because of sampling error [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/19,21,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,33,34</a>]. The therapeutic drainage &quot;window&quot; created by a subxiphoid or transthoracic approach yields a four square centimeter piece of tissue which can be useful to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>A positive cytology may be predictive of a poorer outcome in patients with neoplastic pericardial disease. In a multivariate analysis of patients with malignancy-related pericardial effusion, a positive cytology was an independent predictor of shortened survival (median survival seven versus 30 weeks in the setting of normal cytology) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, given the typically short life expectancy for most patients with malignant pericardial disease, this is less often observed, and sclerotherapy is generally associated with low morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, pericardial sclerosis to prevent reaccumulation has fallen out of general use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical decompression of the pericardium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical decompression of the pericardium is also known as pericardiotomy, pericardiostomy, and &quot;window&quot; pericardiectomy. Surgical creation of a pericardial &quot;window&quot; can be accomplished using various surgical techniques (eg, open surgery, video assisted thoracoscopy [VATS]). While no randomized trials have been done comparing surgical and percutaneous drainage of pericardial effusions, retrospective studies demonstrated immediate hemodynamic benefit in almost all patients with minimal surgical morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy/abstract/50,51,65-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51,65-70</a>].
