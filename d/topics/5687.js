The risk and type of lung toxicity varies among the different agents. (See <a href=\"#H360853949\" class=\"local\">'Features of individual agents'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to direct lung toxicity, virtually all of the disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have immunosuppressive effects that increase the risk of bacterial and opportunistic lung infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. As an example, in an observational study of 16,788 patients with RA, patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> had a higher risk of hospitalization due to pneumonia than patients not taking glucocorticoids (hazard ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The effect was dose dependent. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists were not associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in this study, they have been associated with pneumonia in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-bacterial-viral-and-fungal-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The net effect of the disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on the incidence of drug-induced lung disease in patients with RA is uncertain. Medication side effects may become more common as the clinical use of DMARDs and biological agents such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p>Conversely, DMARDs may have a beneficial impact on the natural history of a variety of forms of rheumatoid-associated lung disease, and use of these drugs may influence the frequency or presentation of these problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In one study of 59 patients with RA who were taking DMARDs but had no pulmonary symptoms, abnormal histology on transbronchial lung biopsy was found in 18 percent of patients on DMARDs, compared to 42 percent of those not taking one of these drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3400844\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of drug-induced lung disease are variable and nonspecific. Symptoms, when present, can develop days to years into therapy and can progress rapidly or indolently. Drug-induced lung disease is one of the causes of rapid progression of interstitial lung disease (ILD) to respiratory failure. Symptoms include cough, dyspnea, low-grade fever, and occasionally a rash. Lung auscultation may reveal focal or bibasilar crackles, but is often normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105098521\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug-induced lung disease is often a diagnosis of exclusion, so the diagnostic approach involves a combination of tests designed to exclude other processes (eg, heart failure, infection, RA-associated interstitial lung disease) and to identify features that are suggestive of a drug-induced process (eg, timing of symptoms relative to drug initiation, eosinophilia in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid). Empiric drug discontinuation is an important diagnostic step. Underlying lung disease due to RA or cigarette smoking may complicate determination of whether current symptoms are caused by a new process or <span class=\"nowrap\">progression/exacerbation</span> of a preexisting process. General approaches to interstitial lung disease and to lung disease in patients with RA are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interstitial lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Clinical evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Diagnostic testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-lung-biopsy-results-in-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of lung biopsy results in interstitial lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory testing</strong> &ndash; Laboratory testing is used to determine whether other disease processes are contributing to the patient's respiratory compromise. Complete cell counts and differential are obtained to look for anemia (suggestive of alveolar hemorrhage), neutrophilia (suggestive of infection), or eosinophilia (suggestive of drug hypersensitivity or fungal infection). B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) can help exclude heart failure as an etiology. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, C-reactive protein (CRP), and serologic studies can also help to identify infectious causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Diagnostic testing&quot;, section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging</strong> &ndash; A chest radiograph is obtained to assess the pattern and extent of disease but high resolution computed tomography of the chest is usually needed for full characterization. Various radiographic patterns of drug-induced injury are described, including patchy or diffuse, unilateral or bilateral reticular markings, ground glass opacities, or consolidation, and pulmonary nodules with or without cavitation. Newly appearing or enlarging pulmonary nodules have been associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, respectively. Pleural effusions have been associated with methotrexate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Leflunomide'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hilar lymphadenopathy is an uncommon manifestation of drug induced disease, except in the case of methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disease or anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced lymphadenopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-induced-lung-injury#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methotrexate-induced lung injury&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary lymphoproliferative disease'</a> and <a href=\"#H360854822\" class=\"local\">'Granulomatous lung disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary Physiology</strong> &ndash; Frequently, patients are too unwell for complete lung function testing, but if they can be obtained, they can aid in documenting changes in lung function. At a minimum, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) at rest and importantly on exertion, such as during a six-minute walk test (6MWT), is helpful in determining the severity of impairment. Hypoxemia at rest or with exertion is common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While uncommon, a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) above the predicted range suggests pulmonary hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide&quot;, section on 'Increased DLCO'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchoscopy</strong> &ndash; After review of clinical findings, laboratory data, and chest imaging, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be needed to exclude processes such as infection, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, or lymphangitic spread of tumor (eg, in the presence of fever, widespread or nodular opacities on chest imaging, or rapidly progressive respiratory impairment). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are no specific findings for drug-induced lung toxicity on bronchoscopy or BAL. BAL fluid cell counts are usually elevated, but the pattern of cellularity is nonspecific. Lymphocytosis, neutrophilia, or eosinophilia may be seen; among these, eosinophilia is more suggestive of a drug-induced process. Thus, the main role of bronchoscopy is to exclude alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of bronchoalveolar lavage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage-in-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of bronchoalveolar lavage in diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Response to therapy</strong> &ndash; Empiric withdrawal of the implicated drug is a key diagnostic and therapeutic step. In general, noninfectious drug-related lung disease often regresses upon withdrawal of the offending medication. After exclusion of infection, a prompt response to systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be a distinguishing feature of drug-induced lung disease, which often responds better to glucocorticoid therapy than RA-related interstitial lung disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lung-disease-associated-with-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lung disease associated with rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interstitial lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lung biopsy &ndash; </strong>Lung biopsy is usually not required, and many patients may be too unwell to undergo this procedure. Often, the clinical picture, radiologic findings, and BAL results excluding infection are sufficiently convincing of the diagnosis to make a biopsy unnecessary, particularly in patients who respond quickly to drug discontinuation. In contrast, a lung biopsy is indicated when the patient has acute, progressive or severe disease and the cause of the pneumonitis is uncertain or when lymphoproliferative disease is suspected on the basis of nodular opacities, and when the biopsy findings will change therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lung biopsy rarely establishes an antirheumatic agent as the definitive source of the lung injury, as there are no pathognomonic findings, and histologic criteria for drug-induced lung disease have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, when available, lung histopathology can characterize the histopathologic pattern (eg, lymphocytic, granulomatous, eosinophilic, or organizing pneumonia or diffuse alveolar damage), which may help to guide therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of lung biopsy in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-lung-biopsy-results-in-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of lung biopsy results in interstitial lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differentiation between a drug reaction, underlying rheumatoid-associated lung disease, infection, and heart failure may be difficult, since there is significant overlap in the clinical syndromes. In addition, many of the pulmonary reactions to drugs used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are rare and are published as case reports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65141\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65141 \">table 1</a>). An online repository of drug-induced lung disease is available to help identify potential culprit medications (<a href=\"http://pneumotox.com/&amp;token=ycWLAghGMDg/m7iUYNuIMuugd4RBBwlKYqPEJCUq9eA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4378\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Pneumotox.com</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. When patients present with fever, rapidly progressive respiratory insufficiency, or widespread or nodular opacities on chest imaging, bacterial and opportunistic lung infections are high on the differential and should be pursued vigorously.

Pulmonary complications of methotrexate are not associated with folate deficiency and may occur with the relatively low doses (&lt;20 mg per week) that are used in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In one study, MTX was associated with progression of preclinical interstitial lung disease (ILD) in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of MTX-induced pneumonitis are discussed in greater detail separately.

Patients typically present with nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and sometimes fever or chest pain. Among those with a subacute onset of MTX-induced lung disease, up to 50 percent demonstrate peripheral blood eosinophilia, which strongly supports the diagnosis, when present. Early drug discontinuation at the onset of respiratory symptoms may obviate the need for invasive testing. &#160;</p><p>Less commonly, interstitial fibrosis (honeycombing), accelerated rheumatoid lung nodulosis, asthma, and air trapping may occur during MTX treatment. In many cases, it is not clear whether these less common abnormalities are drug-related or are due to underlying rheumatoid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p>As noted above, the differential diagnosis of MTX-induced lung disease includes infectious complications, which must be excluded prior to the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy to treat a possible drug reaction.

Overall, the risk appears low, except possibly in patients with underlying ILD or a history of MTX-induced lung toxicity.

This predisposition in patients with RA also extends to the other side effects associated with penicillamine.</p><p>Bronchiolitis obliterans has been described between 3 and 14 months after the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> therapy, and at daily doses of 375 to 1250 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,93</a>]. Patients generally present with the subacute onset of cough and dyspnea on exertion, frequently in the presence of a chest radiograph that is normal or reveals only hyperinflation. CT scans may reveal gas trapping (particularly on expiratory images) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a mosaic pattern of ground glass opacification. A progressive obstructive ventilatory defect without bronchodilator response is generally present on pulmonary function testing.

It is not known whether this is a class effect or a unique feature of certain NSAIDs. </p><p>Cessation of the implicated agent is indicated, as resolution of pulmonary toxicity often accompanies drug discontinuation. Systemic glucocorticoids are generally withheld as long as pneumonitis is stable or improving. In contrast, empiric glucocorticoid therapy is usually initiated in a patient who has rapidly progressive or more severe pulmonary toxicity, although data to support this practice are limited to case reports.

Many of the pulmonary reactions to drugs used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are rare and are published as case reports, but have a high mortality. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary disease may occur with the relatively low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (&lt;20 mg per week) that are used in patients with RA. Acute to subacute interstitial pneumonitis is the most common noninfectious complication of methotrexate in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with methotrexate-induced pneumonitis, the chest radiograph typically demonstrates diffuse bilateral reticular opacities or mixed reticular and ground glass patterns (40 percent). Unilateral or nodular changes, effusions, and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy are uncommon. Early drug discontinuation at the onset of respiratory symptoms may obviate the need for invasive testing. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methotrexate-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial pneumonitis and new and accelerated pulmonary rheumatoid nodule formation have been described with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, although the risk appears low. We generally avoid leflunomide in patients with underlying lung disease or a history of methotrexate-induced lung toxicity, but gathering evidence suggests this may not be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Leflunomide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New onset or progressive pneumonitis may uncommonly occur in patients treated with the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) blockers. A growing number of other biologic agents are being used to treat RA; further study is needed to determine whether they also cause or contribute to RA-associated interstitial pneumonitis. (See <a href=\"#H360854816\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory pneumonitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TNF-alpha inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of reactivation tuberculosis (TB) and other opportunistic infections. Appropriate screening before the start of treatment and vigilance for the occurrence of active TB during therapy are essential. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Tuberculosis screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Granulomatous lung disease and hilar adenopathy are also associated with TNF-alpha inhibitors in the absence of demonstrable mycobacterial or fungal infection. Beyond careful exclusion of infection, the optimal management is not known.

Withdrawal of gold is usually sufficient treatment, but occasionally glucocorticoids are necessary. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Gold'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchiolitis obliterans has been described between 3 and 14 months after the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> therapy. Patients present with cough and dyspnea; chest radiograph shows hyperinflation. There is little evidence that glucocorticoids are of benefit, although a trial of therapy is warranted because of the dismal prognosis.
