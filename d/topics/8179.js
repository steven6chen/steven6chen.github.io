Although the swelling is self-limited, laryngeal involvement may cause fatal asphyxiation. Prior to the availability of effective therapy, this disorder was associated with a mortality rate of approximately 30 percent due to asphyxiation from laryngeal swelling.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, triggering and exacerbating factors, and prognosis of HAE are discussed in this topic review. The laboratory evaluation, establishing definitive diagnosis, and acute and prophylactic therapies of this disorder are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Pathogenesis and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Treatment of acute attacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: General care and long-term prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>HAE types I and II are the focus of this topic review. These disorders are caused by deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor protein. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis#H20554842\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Pathogenesis and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>HAE with normal C1 inhibitor (also called type III HAE) is a clinically similar disorder, seen mostly in women, in which C1 inhibitor is normal. Some patients have factor XII defects. This disorder is discussed separately.

Males and females are affected equally, and there are no known differences in prevalence among ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Age of onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age at which attacks begin is variable, with rare reports of initial episodes of angioedema in the perinatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Approximately 40 percent of patients experience their first attack before age 5, and 75 percent, by age 15, although repeated attacks in preadolescent children are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Thus, for the majority of patients, the disease first presents in childhood or adolescence. Attack frequency usually increases after puberty. In most cases, the diagnosis is eventually made in the second or third decade of life and can be further delayed if there is no family history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) demonstrate characteristic abnormalities in the complement system, upon which the diagnosis is based. These are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Pathogenesis and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other than abnormal complement studies, patients with HAE are usually healthy and most commonly have normal routine laboratory values, although hypergammaglobulinemia has been noted in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristic features of angioedema attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attacks most often affect three anatomical locations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin (cutaneous attacks)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gastrointestinal tract (gastrointestinal attacks)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The upper airway <span class=\"nowrap\">(laryngeal/pharyngeal</span> attacks)</p><p/><p>Many attacks involve only one site at a time, although combination attacks, such as cutaneous attacks that spread to involve the larynx, are not uncommon. Attacks are always self-limited, lasting two to four days, and range in severity from inconvenient cutaneous swelling to life-threatening laryngeal edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of patients experience all three manifestations during the course of their lives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other general observations about HAE include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attack frequency varies from weekly to one or two episodes per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Untreated, patients with frequent attacks may miss up to 100 to 150 work days per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A few subjects remain asymptomatic and are identified as having hereditary C1 inhibitor deficiency only as a result of family screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease severity differs markedly among affected members within families, despite the presence of the same mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Disease severity may also vary significantly in the same patient over time. The factors determining disease severity are unknown. A study found that severity correlated with the presence of elevated levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies to the C1 inhibitor protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This was noted in patients who had never received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=c1-esterase-inhibitor-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">C1 inhibitor concentrate</a> for treatment, as well as in patients who had, so that it did not appear to be related to exposure to this agent. Nor was it proposed to have a direct role in determining disease severity. Rather, it was hypothesized that antibody formation may be a secondary phenomenon resulting from frequent activation of inflammatory pathways during attacks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis#H20554842\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Pathogenesis and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2208859\"><span class=\"h3\">Prodromal symptoms and skin changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prodromal symptoms include fatigue, nausea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, and myalgias and flu-like symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Some patients develop skin changes that are usually described as a serpentine, mottled, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &quot;chicken-wire&quot; pattern of erythematous discoloration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79093 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. These findings can be mistaken for urticaria, but more closely resemble erythema marginatum. Skin changes were noted consistently in 26 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Prodromal symptoms usually occur within 24 hours before the onset of angioedema, although not all prodromal symptoms are followed by an angioedema episode.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Cutaneous attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous attacks are common and temporarily disfiguring, although not generally dangerous. Skin swelling was present in 97 percent of 131,110 edema episodes in a retrospective series of 221 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The extremities, face, and genitals are most commonly affected, although any site can be involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71169\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71169 \">picture 2</a>). Swelling occurs in nondependent areas and is nonpitting. Cutaneous attacks are often associated with pain and dysfunction in addition to swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An episode typically begins in the skin with a peculiar tingling or sensation of fullness and irritation, followed by swelling and a sense of tightness in the next two to three hours. The angioedema builds over the first 24 hours, then gradually subsides over 48 to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Swelling may last up to five days in some patients. Attacks can also last longer if the swelling spreads from one site to another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Laryngeal attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laryngeal swelling can occur in isolation, or in association with swelling of the lips, tongue, uvula, and soft palate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Laryngeal edema occurs in approximately one-half of all patients over their lifetimes; however, only a few percent experience recurrent episodes, and in the large retrospective series mentioned above, laryngeal attacks accounted for less than 1 percent of all angioedema episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Laryngeal attacks are less common in patients over the age of 45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Tooth extraction and oral surgery are common triggers. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Triggers and exacerbating factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Laryngeal swelling usually develops over hours, with a reported mean of seven hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, there are disturbing reports of fulminant laryngeal attacks, including a nine-year-old boy with a family history of HAE, but no previous attacks who died of asphyxiation 20 minutes after the apparent onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Although each laryngeal attack has the potential to become life threatening, the majority resolves before complete airway obstruction, and one large series documented only two intubations and four cricothyrotomies among 342 laryngeal attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In a study of 70 fatal laryngeal attacks, researchers proposed that three phases of an attack can be distinguished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predyspnea phase, which starts with the first noticeable symptom and ends when dyspnea develops (average length, 3.7 hours, range 0 to 11 hours). During this phase, patients typically reported the sensation of a lump or feeling of tightness in the throat or swallowing difficulties, but not frank dyspnea. Six patients did not appear to have a predyspnea phase at all, as their initial symptom was dyspnea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dyspnea phase, from onset of dyspnea to loss of consciousness (average length 41 minutes, range 2 minutes to 4 hours).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The loss of consciousness phase, which starts with loss of consciousness and ends with death (average length 9 minutes, range 2 to 20 minutes).</p><p/><p>Thus, there is a window of opportunity in the predyspnea phase in which patients can seek and receive help, followed by a much shorter period in the dyspnea phase. In this study, 63 patients had not been diagnosed with HAE at the time of death, and 7 had. Possible triggers were apparent in a minority of patients (eight had preceding upper respiratory tract infections and six had tooth extractions). The mean age of death by asphyxiation in undiagnosed patients was 40.6 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal attacks present as varying degrees of gastrointestinal colic, nausea, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These symptoms result from bowel wall edema. Gastrointestinal attacks are experienced by a majority of patients with HAE, and can be the principal presentation in one-quarter of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]. A few families have been reported in which bowel attacks were the only manifestation.</p><p>In a large, mostly retrospective, observational study of over 33,000 gastrointestinal attacks in 153 patients with HAE, symptoms and patterns of symptom development were analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The patients included in this series had received treatment with analgesics or spasmolytics only. All attacks were painful, with a mean pain score of 8.4 on a subjective scale of 1 (minimal) to 10 (maximal). Three-quarters included nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension, and 41 percent involved diarrhea. Four percent of patients experienced circulatory collapse. At least one prodromal symptom occurred at the onset of 70 percent of the attacks, and symptoms included fatigue, irritability, sensitivity to noise, hunger, and erythema marginatum. Attacks lasted four days on average, from the onset of prodromal symptoms to complete resolution, and peaked on the second day.</p><p>Gastrointestinal attacks can be challenging to diagnose and the clinician must determine if the abdominal symptoms are due to angioedema or to an unrelated process. Patients who have had previous gastrointestinal attacks should be questioned carefully to ascertain if their current symptoms are similar to past episodes. Because of the clinical similarities between bowel attacks of angioedema and true surgical emergencies, as many as one-third of patients with undiagnosed HAE may undergo unwarranted abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/7,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H521587\"><span class=\"h4\">Objective findings</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most abdominal attacks are NOT associated with fever, peritoneal signs, or an elevated white blood cell count. However, during severe abdominal attacks, elevations of neutrophils (without increased bands), hypovolemia from fluid losses, or hemoconcentration from plasma extravasation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasodilation have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].

However, if the cause of the patient's presentation is unclear, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis or ultrasonography is useful in confirming the findings of gastrointestinal angioedema. The most common early finding is bowel wall edema, although this may resolve rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].

HAE is characterized clinically by recurrent episodes of angioedema, without accompanying hives or pruritus, which most commonly affect the skin, bowel, or upper airway. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HAE affects men and women equally. There are no known racial predilections. Although symptoms often begin in childhood, the disease is commonly diagnosed during puberty or early adulthood, when attacks become more frequent. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An attack of HAE usually involves one site at a time (skin, viscera, or larynx). A prodrome of fatigue or erythematous rash is noticed by some patients. Attacks build in severity for 24 hours and then subside over the next 24 to 72 hours. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most life-threatening type of attack involves the upper airway, and any swelling in this area should be regarded as an emergency. Laryngeal attacks usually develop over hours, but there are reports of precipitous airway closure. Laryngeal edema occurs in approximately one-half of all patients over their lifetimes, although only a few percent experience recurrent episodes. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Laryngeal attacks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal attacks are experienced by a majority of patients with HAE and present as varying degrees of gastrointestinal colic, nausea, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea, which result from bowel wall edema. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal attacks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous attacks are common and temporarily disfiguring, although not generally dangerous. The extremities, face, and genitals are most commonly affected, although any site can be involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71169\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71169 \">picture 2</a>). Swelling occurs in nondependent areas and is nonpitting. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous attacks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild trauma, including dental work, is the most common trigger for cutaneous and laryngeal attacks. Other triggers that have been reported include estrogens, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, stress, H. pylori infection, and menstruation. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Triggers and exacerbating factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once attacks have begun, they generally continue throughout the patient's life, although the frequency of attacks can be dramatically reduced by therapy. The mortality rate for patients with HAE, despite effective therapies, has been estimated to be as high as 13 percent.
