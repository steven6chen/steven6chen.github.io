Most of these are benign, including inflammatory lesions or follicular adenomas, but a few are malignant. </p><p>The thyroid gland in children is particularly susceptible to irradiation and carcinogenesis. This may be one reason that children with thyroid cancer tend to present with advanced disease. As compared with adults, children with thyroid cancer display a greater frequency of lymph node metastases and distant metastases at the time of diagnosis and higher rates of recurrence during the first decade after diagnosis. Despite these characteristics, children with thyroid cancer generally have a good prognosis.</p><p>The evaluation of a child presenting with a thyroid nodule, and an overview of the treatment of thyroid carcinoma is discussed in this topic review. Congenital and acquired goiter and thyroid cysts are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-goiter-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired goiter in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a study conducted in the southwestern United States, thyroid nodules detectable by palpation were present in 1.8 percent of school children between the ages of 11 and 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a follow-up study 20 years later, nodules were present in only 0.45 percent of the same subjects, showing that nodules disappeared in 75 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a study of 440 schoolchildren aged 5 to 18 years in Athens, thyroid nodules were present in 5.1 percent by ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A survey of 40,302 infants and children around Fukushima intended to document baseline rate of nodules near the time of the 2011 nuclear accident, reported that 0.50 percent had nodules detected by ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While ultrasound might be expected to detect a higher rate of nodules than palpation, this lower rate might represent differences in the prevalence of nodules in children from this Japanese population, compared with studies in different geographic locations or in children with different genetic make-up. In a group of children without suspected thyroid disease who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest, thyroid nodules were detected in 1.4 percent, which is much lower than the rate of unsuspected thyroid nodules detected on CT in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Most thyroid nodules in children are benign, but the percentage of nodules harboring cancer in children is probably higher than the commonly quoted figure of 5 percent in adults. Estimates of the rate of malignancy in published case series vary widely, ranging from 10 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, it may be that the 10 to 50 percent rate of cancer in childhood nodules reported in the past is higher than would be found in more recent series, particularly in &quot;incidentally discovered&quot; nodules. Indeed, malignancy was discovered in 5.7 percent of the nodules incidentally detected by contrast-enhanced CT in the study cited above, which is similar to the reported malignancy rate for thyroid nodules in adults, and substantially lower than the previously reported malignancy rates for children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The following calculations also would support a lower estimate of the malignancy rate in children: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry from 1973 through 2004 reported a total of 1753 pediatric patients with thyroid cancer, with an annual incidence of 0.54 cases per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An annual incidence of 0.54 per 100,000 is equivalent to a prevalence of 10 per 100,000 children aged 1 to 18 years. If 1.8 per 100 children have solitary nodules, but only 10 per 100,000 children develop cancer, approximately only 1 in 180 solitary nodules represents thyroid cancer (0.5 percent). Thus, the higher percentages noted above likely represent &quot;referral bias&quot; of children with increased risk factors for thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The SEER registry reported an increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in children, rising 1.1 percent per year over the 31 year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Another study reported a 3 to 4 percent increase between 1984 and 2010 for children, adolescents, and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several lines of evidence suggest that the thyroid gland in children compared with that in adults is more susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of irradiation.

Follow-up of residents &lt;18 years of age living in Belarus at the time of the Chernobyl nuclear accident (April 1986) showed a 3.82 odds ratio of neoplastic nodules, and that the risk increased with 131-I dose and with younger age at exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, the dose of radiation exposure during childhood of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of thyroid nodules in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The diagnostic process and indications for FNA is similar to that used in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90467\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef90467 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, children with thyroid nodules are somewhat more likely to have cancer than adults. In a study that used this diagnostic process, the rate of cancer in the group undergoing FNA was 22 percent, as compared with 14 percent in adults evaluated by a similar process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The majority of patients will have normal thyroid function tests and should be further evaluated with a neck ultrasound. Patients with low serum TSH probably have a hyperfunctioning nodule, and they should be further evaluated with thyroid scintigraphy as well as ultrasound. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52928198\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid scintigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is low (suggesting a hyperfunctioning nodule), thyroid scintigraphy should be performed, typically using 123-I as a tracer. If the nodule is hyperfunctioning, it is seen as an area of increased uptake, with absent or reduced uptake in the remainder of the gland. While the majority of hyperfunctioning nodules are benign, case series show that between 8 and 29 percent of children may be found to have incidentally discovered papillary or follicular thyroid cancer in autonomous nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a study with more rigorous criteria defining autonomous thyroid nodules in children (both autonomous 123-I uptake into the nodule and suppression of uptake in the normal thyroid parenchyma on scintigraphy performed at a time of TSH suppression), the observed cancer rate in biopsied or resected nodules was 0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. If hyperthyroidism is clinically significant, surgical excision is the recommended treatment in children. Surgery may be deferred in patients with an autonomous nodule and subclinical hyperthyroidism, but FNA should be considered if the nodule has features suspicious for papillary thyroid carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Neck ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next step generally is an ultrasound examination of the neck.

Thus, total or near-total thyroidectomy is the recommended initial surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. One analysis of 1199 patients found that surgical complications were higher in children than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This study reported that recurrent laryngeal nerve injury occurred in 3.8 percent of children aged 0 to 6 years, 1.1 percent in children aged 7 to 12 years, and 0.6 percent in children aged 13 to 17 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Radical neck dissection is not indicated. It is important that surgery in children be performed by an experienced &quot;high-volume&quot; thyroid surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>Despite having more widespread cancer at presentation compared with adults, children with DTC have an excellent prognosis (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below). While the risk of death from DTC is low, a long-term study reported a higher than predicted number of deaths from second primary malignancies after 30 and 50 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In this analysis of all-cause mortality, two-thirds of the deaths resulted from non-thyroidal second malignancies, and three-quarters of these patients had received some form of postoperative therapeutic irradiation. Another study of 3850 pediatric and young adult patients with DTC, of whom 1571 were treated with radioiodine, reported that 26 developed a second primary malignancy as compared with 18.3 expected (a 1.42 standardized incidence-ratio) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The second primary malignancies were mainly salivary cancer and leukemia. Cognizant of this issue, a major goal of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guidelines Task Force was to define cases for which aggressive therapy is indicated, and conversely to limit over-treatment in those children who are unlikely to benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. To this end, the Task Force developed three risk levels of thyroid cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low risk &ndash; </strong>DTC confined to the thyroid (usually &lt;1 cm primary), with no or microscopic metastases to a small number of central compartment neck lymph nodes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intermediate risk</strong> &ndash; Extensive central compartment lymph node metastases or minimal lateral neck lymph node metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High risk</strong> &ndash; Regionally extensive DTC (lateral compartment lymph node metastases), or locally invasive DTC (tumor extends beyond the thyroid capsule), with or without distant metastases.</p><p/><p>In addition to risk classification based on the extent of DTC found at operation as outlined above, the classification also involves a postoperative 123-I scan in intermediate- and high-risk patients and a serum thyroglobulin concentration (measured while on thyroid hormone treatment for low-risk, or TSH-stimulated for intermediate- and high-risk patients). Patients with persistently elevated serum thyroglobulin levels (usually &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> are likely to have residual cancer. If the 123-I scan shows uptake outside the thyroid bed, the next step is to undertake imaging to attempt to locate the abnormal lymph node(s). Imaging typically starts with an ultrasound examination, but if abnormal lymph nodes are not identified, <span class=\"nowrap\">SPECT/CT</span> (single photon emission computed tomography) or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be considered. If abnormal lymph nodes are identified in a location that is amenable to surgery, surgical excision may be a reasonable treatment option. Those patients with uptake outside the thyroid bed that is not amenable to surgical resection, or who have evidence of distant metastases, are candidates for radioiodine treatment.</p><p>In those children classified as low-risk (cancer confined to the thyroid gland, no or only microscopic metastases to a small number of central neck lymph nodes, and with a serum thyroglobulin &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> the Task Force concluded that 131-I treatment was not indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Children with the &quot;noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features&quot; variant also are not candidates for 131-I treatment, as this neoplasm rarely recurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>After thyroidectomy, children with intermediate or high-risk DTC are treated with radioactive iodine to ablate residual thyroid tissue or persistent disease; radioiodine treatment has been associated with a lower rate of locoregional recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. If radioactive iodine administration is indicated, either for follow-up diagnostic studies or as treatment to ablate a thyroid remnant, recombinant human thyrotropin (TSH) preparation in children has been shown to be as effective as thyroid hormone withdrawal in achieving the desired elevation in TSH levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In general, children achieve adequate elevation of serum TSH within 14 days of thyroid hormone withdrawal, obviating the need for T3 treatment during thyroid hormone withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-nodules-and-cancer-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>Children should be treated with T4 to keep the serum TSH concentration at the lower limit of normal.

The recommended age of &quot;prophylactic&quot; thyroidectomy in an asymptomatic but RET gene-positive infant or child is based on their risk level, which correlates with the RET mutation.

Patients were initially treated with either subtotal (18 patients) or total thyroidectomy (18 patients), and 23 also received postoperative radioactive iodine. Recurrence was more common in patients with lymph node involvement and those with multiple nodules. Recurrence occurred in 5 patients with subtotal and in 12 patients with total thyroidectomy, developing at a median of 7 months (range 1 to 43 months) after the first operation. Two recurrences were within the thyroid bed, and the others were localized to lymph nodes. Operative resection followed by selective radioactive iodine ablation successfully treated 14 of the 17 patients with recurrent disease.

Most thyroid nodules are asymptomatic because the majority of children are euthyroid. Children with a toxic adenoma will have clinical and laboratory features of hyperthyroidism. The majority of thyroid nodules represent benign conditions. In children with nodules that meet criteria for fine needle aspiration (FNA), a report found that 22 percent had differentiated thyroid cancer.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most thyroid cancers in children are differentiated (papillary or follicular). About 5 percent are medullary thyroid carcinomas, which usually occur in association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.

Children with non-medullary thyroid cancer should be carefully evaluated for clinical features of a phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartoma syndrome (Cowden or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome), which include macrocephaly, autism or developmental delay, and penile freckling or other benign skin lesions.

Using criteria in the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in children, patients can be classified as low-, intermediate-, or high-risk; postoperative management and surveillance should be individualized, based on risk level. In those children classified as low-risk, 131-I treatment is not indicated. Children should be treated with T4 to keep the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration at the lower limit of normal, with the TSH-target range based on risk level.
