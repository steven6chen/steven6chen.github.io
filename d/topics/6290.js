In the United States, it is estimated that 25 percent of adults over the age of 60 have lost all their teeth (edentulism), approximately one-half from periodontal disease and one-half from dental caries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In addition to producing pain and discomfort, odontogenic infections can extend beyond natural barriers and result in potentially life-threatening complications, such as infections of the deep fascial spaces of the head and neck. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Periodontal infection can also be associated with a number of systemic disorders. These include fever of unknown origin, bacteremic seeding of heart valves and prosthetic devices, preterm birth of low birth weight children, and an increased risk for coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular events. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Association with cardiovascular risk'</a> below.)</p><p>A thorough understanding of the anatomic considerations and salient clinical features is essential for early recognition and effective treatment of these infections and their complications. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of odontogenic infections will be reviewed here. The gingivitis and periodontitis syndromes that can occur and the complications, diagnosis, and treatment of these infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gingivitis and periodontitis in adults: Classification and dental treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-odontogenic-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications, diagnosis, and treatment of odontogenic infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both dental caries and periodontal disease are prevalent in the United States and other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a report from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) involving 8366 noninstitutionalized adults in the United States from 1988 to 1991, approximately 90 percent were dentate but only 30 percent still retained all of their natural teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, a series of subsequent studies from NHANES demonstrated a substantial reduction in the prevalence rates of both dental caries and periodontal disease since 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a report that demonstrated the following differences when 1999 to 2002 results were compared with those from 1988 to 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in the prevalence of caries in permanent teeth of up to 10 percent occurred among persons aged 6 to 19 years, and up to 6 percent among dentate adults 20 years of age or older.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 6 percent reduction in total tooth loss (edentulism) among persons aged 60 years or older.</p><p/><p>This global trend toward better dental health has been attributed to a variety of factors including fluoridation of drinking water, use of dentifrices, improved diet with sucrose substitutes, and emphasis on oral health.</p><p>Despite these favorable trends, the overall burden of dental caries and periodontal disease remains high, particularly since both diseases are diagnosable, treatable, and potentially preventable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In a report of NHANES data from 2009 and 2010, 64.7 million adults older than age 30 had periodontitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Worldwide, 15 to 20 percent of adults between the ages of 35 and 44 years have severe periodontal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The main cause of tooth loss varies with age. Dental caries is most important before the age of 35 and periodontal disease after the age of 35. Both tooth decay and periodontal disease are important contributors to tooth loss after age 60. However, loss of teeth is no longer considered an inevitable and irreversible part of aging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans have two sets of teeth: deciduous (milk or baby) teeth and permanent teeth. The 20 deciduous teeth erupt at approximately six months to two years of age and are shed between the ages of 6 and 12. These are gradually replaced by 32 permanent teeth, consisting in each half jaw of two incisors, one canine, two premolars, and, in adults, three molars.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tooth structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each tooth has a visible crown that projects above the gingiva (gum), with one or more roots extending into the alveolar bone of the maxilla or mandible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68403 \">figure 1</a>). The crown and root meet at the neck of the tooth.</p><p>The tooth forms a peg and socket joint with the alveolar bone and is held in place by the periodontal membrane, which allows slight movement of the tooth. The hard tissues of the tooth are dentin, enamel, and cementum; the soft tissues are the pulp, the periodontal membrane, and the gingiva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68403 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The pulp filling the core of the tooth is composed of fibroblasts and connective tissue, and is supplied by blood vessels and nerves entering the pulp cavity through the apical foramen. At the periphery of the pulp is a layer of odontoblasts. Odontoblastic processes extend through the dentin in small canals called dentinal tubules. The odontoblasts with their processes lay down dentin, which forms the bulk of the tooth. Dentin is similar to bone but is harder because of a greater calcium content.</p><p>The crown of the tooth is covered with enamel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68403 \">figure 1</a>), which is 99 percent inorganic and the hardest material in the body. The ultrastructure of enamel reveals units called enamel rods or prisms, which are embedded in a matrix. Both the rods and the interprismatic matrix are composed of apatite crystals.</p><p>Enamel is laid down by ameloblasts, which form a membrane called the enamel cuticle on the surface of the unerupted tooth. With eruption of the tooth, the cuticle is worn off and lost.</p><p>Similar to enamel coverage of dentin in the crown, cementum covers dentin in the root of the tooth from the neck to the apex. Cementum is structurally similar to bone, with cementocytes lying in lacunae and interconnected by canaliculi. Thick collagen bundles, known as Sharpey's fibers, run from the alveolar bone through the periodontal tissue into the cementum, and serve to anchor the tooth to the surrounding connective tissue.</p><p>Finally, the gingiva surrounds each tooth like a collar and extends down over the crest of the alveolar bone to connect to the tooth just above the neck. The space formed between the tooth and the gingiva is called the gingival crevice or recess.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Spread of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Odontogenic infections originate from plaque composed of bacteria that colonize the surfaces of the tooth. The type of infection varies with the site of the plaques:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaques located on tooth surfaces above the gingival margin (supragingival plaque) lead to dental caries that may invade the pulp (pulpitis or endodontic infection), and eventually perforate the alveolar bone (periapical abscess).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaques located on tooth surfaces beneath the gingival margin (subgingival plaque) lead to periodontal infections (eg, gingivitis, periodontitis, and periodontal abscess) that may eventually penetrate the fascial spaces of the face and mouth (orofacial space infections).</p><p/><p>Soft tissue infections of odontogenic origin tend to spread along planes of least resistance from the supporting structures of the affected tooth to various potential spaces in the vicinity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77988\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77988 \">figure 2</a>). Accumulated pus must perforate bone, generally at the site where it is thinnest and weakest, before extending into the periapical areas or deeper fascial spaces. In the mandible, for example, the two points where the bone is weakest and where perforation tends to occur are on the lingual aspect in the region of the molar teeth, and anteriorly on the buccal aspect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In the maxilla, the bone is weakest on the buccal aspect throughout, and is relatively thicker on the palatal aspect.</p><p>The local anatomic barriers of bone, muscle, and fascia predetermine the routes of spread, extent, and clinical manifestations of many orofacial infections of odontogenic origin:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If pus perforates through either the maxillary or mandibular buccal plate inside the attachment of the buccinator muscle, infection will be intraoral; if the perforation is outside this muscle attachment, infection will be extraoral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77988\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77988 \">figure 2</a>). Thus, infection of the upper and lower molars, lower incisors, and lower canine teeth is often accompanied by extraoral manifestations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a mandibular infection perforates lingually, it presents in the sublingual space if the apices of the involved teeth lie above the attachment of the mylohyoid muscle (eg, mandibular incisor, canines, premolars, and first molars), and in the submandibular space if below the attachment of the muscle (eg, the second and third molars) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77988\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77988 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p>There are a number of clinically important &quot;fascial spaces&quot; around the face and oral cavity that are often involved in odontogenic infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80359 \">figure 3</a>). These are potential spaces between layers of fascia that communicate with one another to varying degrees. A thorough understanding of the &quot;anatomic routes&quot; of infection provides valuable information about the nature and extent of infection and also suggests the optimal surgical approach for drainage. Infections involving the deep fascial spaces of the neck are described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND PREDISPOSING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned in the preceding section, plaque formation plays a central role in both dental caries and periodontal infection and the type of infection varies with the site of the plaque.</p><p>Both host and microbial factors influence plaque formation and its ability to cause dental caries or periodontal disease. Oral hygiene, diet, and genetic predisposition are determinants of risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Dental caries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dental caries refers to the localized destruction of dental hard tissues by plaque bacteria that are acidogenic (acid-producing) and aciduric (able to grow at low pH), particularly Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp, which also colonize the tooth surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of caries'</a> below.)</p><p>Teeth have at least three intrinsic mechanisms that protect against carious decay:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A constant flow of saliva, which is at a neutral pH, bathes the tooth, buffers and washes away bacterial acids, and supplies calcium and phosphate to remineralize and repair damaged tooth surfaces. In addition, saliva and its various constituents, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, beta-lysin, and immunoglobulins, possess important antimicrobial activity against plaque-associated bacteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cleansing action of the tongue and buccal membranes, which remove food particles from the proximity of the tooth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acquisition by the tooth of an acellular structureless bacteria-free coating known as the acquired pellicle, which is of salivary origin and acts as a surface barrier to most dietary and bacterial acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>The oral cavity also has an innate immune response that is characterized by secretion of various antimicrobial peptides (defensins) by oral epithelial tissues in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in defensin induction, and epithelial cells from different body sites appear to have common signaling mechanisms to distinguish commensal from pathogenic bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>A final protective modality is tooth brushing and flossing to physically remove food particles and bacterial plaques adherent to the tooth surface. With poor dental hygiene, the acquired pellicle becomes colonized with bacteria and is replaced by supragingival and subgingival bacterial plaques that ultimately progress to dental caries.</p><p>Older individuals form dental plaques more rapidly, although patients of all ages are susceptible to the development of plaque if daily oral care is withheld [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Gingival recession, which is both more common and more severe with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], increases the susceptibility to root caries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Periodontal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodontal disease is mainly caused by microorganisms within the subgingival dental plaque, which penetrate the gingival epithelium, elicit an inflammatory host response, and ultimately result in destruction of the periodontium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68403 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>]. This tissue destruction results in apical migration of gingival tissues (gingival recession), loss of periodontal attachment, and an increase in the depth of the gingival crevice (periodontal pockets). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of periodontal disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Predisposing factors for periodontal disease include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate oral hygiene and increasing age, which are the two major risk factors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal effects, with exacerbation of disease activity during puberty, menstruation, and pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain underlying diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, various genetic disorders that impair neutrophil function, and rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. </p><p/><p>Bone loss is a serious complication of periodontal disease. The mechanism by which this might occur was evaluated in a study in which peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with periodontitis were transplanted into immunodeficient mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans stimulated the human CD4+ cells to express osteoprotegerin ligand, which is an osteoclast activator.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbial specificity in odontogenic infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the healthy oral cavity, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, and diphtheroids account for more than 80 percent of the total cultivable flora (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81076\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81076 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Quantitative studies indicate that obligate anaerobes are present in numbers as much as eight times those of facultative bacteria in certain locations.</p><p>Many clinically significant oral anaerobic gram-negative bacilli previously included under the &quot;oral Bacteroides&quot; group, are now reclassified as Porphyromonas or Prevotella species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Facultative gram-negative bacilli are uncommon in the healthy host, but may be more prominent in seriously ill and hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The oral cavity cannot be regarded as a single uniform environment. Although representative species of microorganisms can be isolated from most areas of the mouth, specific organisms tend to colonize certain sites. As an example, Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella spp have a predilection for the tongue and buccal mucosa and predominate before the eruption of teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, Streptococcus sanguinis (formerly S. sanguis), Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus preferentially colonize the tooth surface. Fusobacterium, pigmented Prevotella, and anaerobic spirochetes appear to be concentrated in the gingival crevice.</p><p>Bacterial adherence and interaggregation, local environmental conditions, such as oxygen tension and pH, and other host factors seem to govern these unique colonization patterns and influence the composition of the oral flora.</p><p>There is growing awareness of the infectious nature of dental caries, and that only certain microorganisms residing within dental plaques are cariogenic (ie, the specific plaque hypothesis of dental caries and periodontal disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80644\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80644 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. This hypothesis states that there are non-diseased plaques, which are associated with good dental health, and that environmental influences cause rearrangement of this &quot;normal&quot; flora, which can lead to either cariogenic or periodontopathic plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis of caries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dental caries are caused by microorganisms within the supragingival plaque, which include gram-positive facultative and microaerophilic cocci and rods. The mutans group of streptococci, particularly S. mutans and S. sobrinus, are the primary organisms associated with dental caries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The ingestion of carbohydrates, especially monosaccharides and disaccharides is also important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Studies of decayed fissures have identified high levels of these mutans streptococci, as have studies comparing the microflora of carious and non-carious teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These streptococci are transmissible between humans, and infants are often infected by salivary contact with their mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>S. mutans readily colonize the tooth surface shortly after eruption. However, they do not become cariogenic until exposed to dietary sucrose, which can be rapidly sequestered and utilized by plaque-associated organisms, including S. mutans, some lactobacilli, and other acidogenic and aciduric organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The following mechanisms contribute to this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaque bacteria that ferment dietary sucrose produce acids that lower the pH on the tooth surface, promoting demineralization and eventually, tooth decay.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaque bacteria, such as S. mutans can also utilize sucrose to produce extracellular polysaccharides, known as glucans, which are adhesive polymers that enable mutans streptococci to avidly stick to the tooth surface, thereby causing decay in the underlying structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, both acidogenicity (ability to produce acid) and aciduricity (ability to grow at low pH) are important attributes for S. mutans and lactobacilli to survive and flourish within a cariogenic plaque and cause tooth decay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis of periodontal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with dental caries, a unique and specific bacterial composition of the subgingival plaque has been identified in gingivitis and periodontitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31</a>]. In the healthy periodontium, the microflora are sparse and consist mainly of gram-positive organisms, such as Streptococcus sanguinis and Actinomyces spp. In the presence of gingivitis, the predominant subgingival flora shift to a greater proportion of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, with Prevotella intermedia as the predominant isolate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In well-established periodontitis, the flora further increase in complexity with a preponderance of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and motile organisms. Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (a HACEK infection), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythensis (formerly, Bacteroides forsythus) are the predominant isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In juvenile periodontitis, a clinical variant seen primarily in adolescents, the subgingival plaque mainly consists of saccharolytic organisms, with A. actinomycetemcomitans and Capnocytophaga spp as the most common identifiable isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. P. gingivalis is rarely found in this condition. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Periodontitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Animal and human studies have shown that periodontal disease is caused by tissue destruction due to inflammation induced by a predominantly anaerobic periodontopathic subgingival plaque flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Specific virulence factors by selective periodontopathic bacteria, such as lipopolysaccharide and proteolytic enzymes, play a role. However, host factors, such as an exaggerated inflammatory response and genetic predisposition, as well as environmental factors, such as smoking and malnutrition, may be even more important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In contrast to its role in dental caries, dietary carbohydrate intake does not appear to have a significant role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.</p><p>Suppurative odontogenic infections, such as periapical abscess or fascial space infections, occur when local or systemic host defenses breakdown, due to disruption of mucosal barriers or immunocompromise from underlying disease. Polymicrobial flora are usually present, with Fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, Actinomyces, and Streptococcus spp as the most predominant isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

In addition to local symptoms, these infections can also be associated with a number of systemic disorders. These include fever of unknown origin, bacteremic seeding of heart valves and prosthetic devices, preterm birth of low birth weight children, and an increased risk for coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Dentoalveolar infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dentoalveolar infections include dental caries, pulpitis, and periapical abscess.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Dental caries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caries occur at either the coronal or root surfaces of the affected tooth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68403 \">figure 1</a>). The prevalence of coronal caries among dentate persons in the United States increases rapidly with age up to the mid-forties and remains stable thereafter; in contrast, the prevalence of root caries continues to increase dramatically with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/1,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,42</a>]. Coronal caries are more likely to present as recurrent lesions around existing restorations; they are more difficult to detect clinically than new carious lesions.</p><p>The earliest findings are the presence of pits and fissures on the affected tooth surface, which gradually becomes stained due to demineralization of enamel and dentin. Further destruction eventually leads to collapse of the overlying enamel. Since there are no cells or vascular elements in enamel or dentin except for the secondary odontoblasts lying on the pulpal surface, the diseased area is incapable of healing and replacement.</p><p>The typical clinical presentation of a new carious lesion is a soft to rubbery textured and discolored defect on the tooth surface. Rapidly progressive caries tend to be soft and can be painful due to involvement of the pulp.</p><p>Most coronal caries develop slowly, since the infection must spread through highly calcified enamel and dentin. As a result, the lesions are more likely to be longstanding, hard, and asymptomatic. The carious process progresses silently until the infection has invaded deeply enough into the pulp to cause pulpal reaction, and eventually the crown is destroyed.</p><p>Root caries occur on the tooth surface where gingival recession has occurred, and are characterized by discrete, well-defined, soft, and discolored defects on the root surface or at the junction of the crown and the root. Root caries can be more difficult to diagnose than coronal caries, since they tend to occur in the interproximal tooth surfaces, which are relatively inaccessible to brushing and are particularly prone to decay from retained food debris.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulpitis and periapical abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection of the pulp (pulpitis) can occur in one of three ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Through a defect in the enamel and dentin that results from extension of a carious lesion, traumatic fracture, or a dental procedure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Through the apical foramen or lateral canals (eg, from a periodontal pocket or an adjacent tooth with a periapical abscess)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Through hematogenous seeding of the pulp that has been irritated mechanically.</p><p/><p>Once infected, the acute inflammatory reaction causes a rapid build-up of pressure inside this rigid and unyielding space, compressing the blood vessels that enter the pulp cavity through the apical foramen, and causing ischemia and necrosis of the pulp tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68403 \">figure 1</a>). Pus may egress out of a cavity in the crown if one exists; it may extrude apically into the surrounding periodontal tissue, resulting in acute periapical periodontitis; or it may erode out of the apical foramen, resulting in periapical or alveolar abscess. The accumulation of pus causes loss of bone and periodontal tissue, and may extend to involve other teeth.</p><p>The early and dominant symptom of acute pulpitis is a severe toothache that can be elicited by thermal changes, especially cold drinks. The involved tooth also may be sensitive to palpation and percussion. As the disease progresses, the pain becomes severe and continuous, with increased intensity in the recumbent position.</p><p>In a more indolent form of the condition, called chronic pulpitis, the inflammation is low grade with partial drainage of the infected material. Symptoms are characterized by a mild and dull intermittent pain that is not affected by thermal changes.</p><p>A more serious complication, lateral extension of the abscesses into planes of least resistance, results in deep fascial space involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Periodontal infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodontal disease includes gingivitis and periodontitis. The main complication of periodontal disease is tooth loss, although local and systemic spread of infection can occur, leading to periodontal abscess and possibly orofacial space infections. The different syndromes are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gingivitis-and-periodontitis-in-adults-classification-and-dental-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gingivitis and periodontitis in adults: Classification and dental treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Gingivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common periodontal disease in childhood, gingivitis, has a peak incidence in adolescence. The manifestations, which can range from mild to severe, include swelling, bluish purple discoloration of the gingiva, and a tendency to bleed after eating or brushing. There is usually no pain, but a mild fetor oris (halitosis) may be noticed.</p><p>The inciting dental plaque may be difficult to observe until it has reached a certain thickness and becomes discolored or is calcified (calculus or tartar). Calculus is prevalent among all age groups, ranging from 74 to over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The frequency of subgingival calculus, but not the percentage of involved sites, increases directly with age, probably related to the preponderance of gingival recession and root caries in older individuals.</p><p>Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), also known as Vincent's angina or trench mouth, is relatively rare in the post-antibiotic era. The patient typically experiences a sudden onset of pain in the gingiva, and the tissue appears eroded with superficial grayish pseudomembranes. Other manifestations include halitosis, altered taste sensation, fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Periodontitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic adult periodontitis, which is characterized by gingival inflammation with accompanying loss of supportive connective tissues including alveolar bone, results in loss of attachment of the periodontal ligament to the cementum. The prevalence of severe periodontal destruction (defined as 5 mm of loss of attachment or more) rises sharply with age, from 8 percent among adults 30 to 39 years of age to 35 percent among persons 60 to 69 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the extent of severe involvement, even in elderly adults, is not high, with fewer than 5 percent of surveyed teeth affected in each individual. Similarly, the prevalence of deep periodontal pockets (defined as 5 mm or greater) is relatively low in all age groups (7 to 12 percent), with less than 2 percent of surveyed teeth affected among patients 60 years or older.</p><p>The destructive process is slow, probably due to years of dental neglect and chronic gingivitis. Plaque and calculi are abundant both supragingivally and subgingivally, and frank pus may be present in the periodontal pockets. Rapidly progressive periodontitis is a variant in adults in whom the process of tissue loss is accelerated.</p><p>In juvenile periodontitis or periodontosis in adolescents, there is rapid vertical bone loss often localized to the molars, although other teeth may be involved. Plaque is usually minimal, and calculi are not seen. The etiology of this rare condition is not known although neutrophil dysfunction has been reported in these otherwise healthy patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-odontogenic-infections/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Periodontal abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodontal abscess may be focal or diffuse and presents as a red, fluctuant swelling of the gingiva, which is extremely tender to palpation.

The infection involves the wisdom teeth in adolescents and adults, and occurs during the eruption of the permanent teeth in children. The major symptoms include pain and limitation of movement on opening the jaw, discomfort on mastication and swallowing, and facial swelling.</p><p>The pericoronal tissues are erythematous and swollen, and digital pressure can often express an exudate from under the infected flap. The masticator spaces are often involved, which can produce trismus.

In addition to producing pain and discomfort, odontogenic infections can extend beyond natural barriers and result in potentially life-threatening complications, such as infections of the deep fascial spaces of the head and neck. The main cause of tooth loss varies with age. Dental caries is most important before the age of 35 and periodontal disease after the age of 35. Both tooth decay and periodontal disease are important contributors to tooth loss after age 60. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each tooth has a visible crown that projects above the gingiva (gum), with one or more roots extending into the alveolar bone of the maxilla or mandible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68403 \">figure 1</a>). The crown and root meet at the neck of the tooth. The tooth forms a peg and socket joint with the alveolar bone and is held in place by the periodontal membrane, which allows slight movement of the tooth. The hard tissues of the tooth are dentin, enamel, and cementum; the soft tissues are the pulp, the periodontal membrane, and the gingiva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68403 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Odontogenic infections originate from plaque composed of bacteria that colonize the surfaces of the tooth. The type of infection varies with the site of the plaques:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plaques located on tooth surfaces above the gingival margin (supragingival plaque) lead to dental caries that may invade the pulp (pulpitis or endodontic infection), and eventually perforate the alveolar bone (periapical abscess).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plaques located on tooth surfaces beneath the gingival margin (subgingival plaque) lead to periodontal infections (eg, gingivitis, periodontitis, and periodontal abscess) that may eventually penetrate the fascial spaces of the face and mouth (orofacial space infections). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Spread of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue infections of odontogenic origin tend to spread along planes of least resistance from the supporting structures of the affected tooth to various potential spaces in the vicinity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77988\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77988 \">figure 2</a>). The local anatomic barriers of bone, muscle, and fascia predetermine the routes of spread, extent, and clinical manifestations of many orofacial infections of odontogenic origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80359\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80359 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Spread of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dental caries are caused by microorganisms within the supragingival plaque, which include gram-positive facultative and microaerophilic cocci and rods. The mutans group of streptococci, particularly S. mutans and S. sobrinus, are the primary organisms associated with dental caries. The ingestion of carbohydrates, especially monosaccharides and disaccharides is also important. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of caries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the healthy periodontium, the microflora are sparse and consist mainly of gram-positive organisms, such as Streptococcus sanguinis and Actinomyces spp. In the presence of gingivitis, the predominant subgingival flora shift to a greater proportion of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, with Prevotella intermedia as the predominant isolate. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of periodontal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodontal disease is caused by tissue destruction due to inflammation induced by a predominantly anaerobic periodontopathic subgingival plaque flora. In well-established periodontitis, the flora further increase in complexity with a preponderance of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and motile organisms. Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (a HACEK infection), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythensis (formerly, Bacteroides forsythus) are the predominant isolates. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of periodontal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dentoalveolar infections include dental caries, pulpitis, and periapical abscess.
