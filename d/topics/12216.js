It is a traction apophysitis of the proximal tibial tubercle at the insertion of the patellar tendon.</p><p>The clinical features and management of Osgood-Schlatter disease will be discussed here. Causes of knee pain and the general approach to the diagnosis of knee pain in children and adolescents are discussed separately.

The patellar tendon arises from the inferior pole of the patella, a sesamoid bone within the quadriceps tendon. The quadriceps muscle is involved in knee extension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osgood-Schlatter disease generally occurs in children 9 to 14 years of age who have undergone a rapid growth spurt. It occurs in approximately 20 percent of adolescents who are active in sports compared with 5 percent of nonathletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is bilateral in 25 to 50 percent of cases, although the involvement is typically asymmetric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Osgood-Schlatter has traditionally occurred most commonly in boys. However, it is becoming more common in girls as their sports participation increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Osgood-Schlatter typically occurs one to two years earlier in girls than in boys, corresponding to the different timing of the pubertal growth spurt. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;, section on 'Growth spurt'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osgood-Schlatter occurs most frequently in participants of sports that involve running, cutting, and jumping (eg, soccer, football, basketball, volleyball, gymnastics, figure skating, ballet) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These activities place stress on the tibial tubercle through repetitive contraction of the quadriceps muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osgood-Schlatter disease is an overuse injury caused by repetitive strain and chronic avulsion of the secondary ossification center (apophysis) of the tibial tubercle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Chronic avulsion causes separation of the proximal patellar tendon insertion from the tibial tubercle, which results in elevation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73362\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73362 \">figure 2</a>). As callous is laid down during healing, the tubercle may become markedly pronounced. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Complications and sequelae'</a> below.)</p><p>Other factors that may be related to the development of Osgood-Schlatter disease include a more proximal attachment of the patellar tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], attachment to a broader area of the tibia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], a history of calcaneal apophysitis (Sever syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and a high-riding patella (patella alta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patella alta requires increased force from the quadriceps for full extension, which may contribute to apophyseal stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the temporal relationship between patella alta and Osgood-Schlatter has not been established, and it is possible that patella alta is the effect, rather than the cause, of Osgood-Schlatter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osgood-Schlatter typically occurs in the 13 to 14-year-old boy or skeletally equivalent 11 to 12-year-old girl who has recently undergone a rapid growth spurt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The most common presenting complaint is anterior knee pain that increases gradually over time, from a low-grade ache to pain that causes a limp <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impairs activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Pain is exacerbated by direct trauma, kneeling, running, jumping, squatting, climbing stairs, or walking uphill, and is relieved by rest. Involvement usually is asymmetric, although both knees are involved in 25 to 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/3,4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatter disease is made by clinical examination. Radiographs are not necessary unless the patient has atypical complaints (pain at night, pain that is unrelated to activity, acute onset of pain, associated systemic complaints) or pain that is not directly over the tibial tubercle. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A description of the complete knee examination for children and adolescents is provided separately.

Pain may be reproduced by extending the knee against resistance, stressing the quadriceps, or squatting with the knee in full flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Straight-leg raising usually is painless. Pain that is more prominent in the patellar tendon than the bony prominence is suggestive of patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Quadriceps flexibility is assessed by passively flexing the knee with the patient prone (ie, the Ely test) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64226 \">figure 3</a>). The range of motion of the knee is not affected, and the knee and patellofemoral joints are stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>]. The remainder of the knee examination is usually normal.</p><p>Erythema and warmth of the tibial tubercle, which suggest an acute inflammatory process, require additional evaluation (eg, for osteomyelitis). However, these findings must be interpreted with caution in patients who have used an ace wrap or heating pad before presenting for evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Examination of patients with knee pain should include evaluation of range of motion of the hip to make sure that the knee pain is not related to referred pain from pathology in the hip (eg, due to slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osgood-Schlatter occurs most frequently in participants of sports that involve running, cutting, and jumping and who have recently undergone a rapid growth spurt. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common presenting complaint is anterior knee pain that increases gradually over time; the pain is exacerbated by direct trauma, kneeling, running, jumping, squatting, climbing stairs, or walking uphill, and is relieved by rest. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatter is made clinically. The characteristic findings are tenderness and soft tissue or bony prominence of the tibial tubercle in a patient with an otherwise normal examination (including range of motion of the hip). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis in cases with characteristic features but may be necessary to exclude other conditions in patients with atypical complaints, such as pain at night, rest-related pain, acute onset of pain (especially after trauma), associated systemic complaints, or pain that is not directly over the tibial tubercle. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osgood-Schlatter disease usually is a benign and self-limited condition. Symptoms generally resolve once the growth plate is ossified. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Nonsurgical treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conservative measures are the mainstay of therapy. We suggest the following conservative measures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Application of ice to the involved area after participating in sporting activities. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Analgesics or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs of limited duration as needed for pain. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Continued sports participation, provided that the pain can be tolerated and resolves within 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Activity continuation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Physical therapy to strengthen the quadriceps and stretch the quadriceps and hamstrings. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Physical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with persistent pain that alters their ability to participate in sports for more than three months may benefit from injection of hyperosmolar dextrose (eg, 12.5 percent dextrose) by a sports medicine specialist or orthopedic surgeon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, children and adolescents with Osgood-Schlatter disease and their parents should be educated regarding the anticipated disease course. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Education'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have pain that persists after closure of the proximal tibial growth plate and is related to bony or cartilaginous ossicles may benefit from surgical excision. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Surgical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications and sequelae of Osgood-Schlatter disease may include persistent prominence of the tibial tubercle, persistent pain (usually related to a residual ossicle), and genu recurvatum.
