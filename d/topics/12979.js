Three distinct clinical forms of BL are recognized: endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated. Although they are histologically identical and have similar clinical behavior, there are differences in epidemiology, clinical presentation, and genetic features between the three forms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>BL and Burkitt leukemia are classified as different manifestations of the same disease in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The WHO classification also recognizes the existence of tumors with features intermediate between BL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, which remain difficult diagnostic challenges. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of BL will be discussed here. Information regarding the diagnosis and treatment of BL is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CELL OF ORIGIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BL is derived from germinal or post-germinal center B cells. The germinal or post-germinal center ancestry of these cells is principally supported by the identification of somatic mutations in the variable region of the immunoglobulin genes (IgV), which serve as a marker of germinal center transit, as well as the tumor cell immunophenotype. Some studies have demonstrated ongoing somatic mutation, a process that is normally restricted to germinal center B cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Other genetic abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p>The different clinical subtypes of BL (ie, endemic, nonendemic, and immunodeficiency-related) likely arise from B cells at different stages of development. Specifically, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative BLs show a low level of somatic hypermutation of their variable region heavy chain genes and no signs of antigen selection, whereas EBV-positive (generally endemic or AIDS-related) BLs have significantly higher levels of somatic hypermutation and evidence of antigen selection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These findings suggest that EBV-negative BL may arise from an early centroblast, while EBV-positive BL may arise from a memory B cell or late germinal center B cell. This difference in cell of origin may also relate to the observed difference in c-MYC translocation breakpoints described below. Despite these differences, these clinical subtypes have many similarities in gene expression suggesting a common pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Chromosomal translocations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of BL is dependent upon the constitutive expression of the c-MYC proto-oncogene located at chromosome 8q24, which encodes the MYC protein transcription factor. This transcription factor modulates the expression of target genes that regulate many cellular processes, including cell growth, division, death, metabolism, adhesion, and motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Cells can generate high levels of c-MYC protein through various mechanisms as described in the sections below.</p><p>The vast majority of BL has c-MYC rearrangements. However, additional factors beyond c-MYC translocation must be present for the development of BL. In support of this idea, a small percentage of HIV positive persons and healthy controls have c-MYC translocations in B lymphocytes isolated from enlarged lymph nodes that do not appear to predict the emergence of later lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">c-MYC in normal cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The c-MYC gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed nuclear phosphoprotein that functions as a pleiotropic transcriptional regulator controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In vivo, c-MYC is found mainly in heterodimeric complexes with the related protein MAX; these heterodimers bind to the &quot;E box consensus sequence&quot; and directly activate transcription. The MYC-MAX interaction is required for c-MYC to stimulate transcription and cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Remarkably, there appear to be thousands of bona fide <span class=\"nowrap\">MYC/MAX</span> binding sites in the genome that permit MYC to regulate the expression of thousands of genes, leading to the idea that it may be better viewed as a global regulator of chromatin and gene expression than as a conventional transcription factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As a result, cells that express high levels of c-MYC produce far more RNA per cell than those that do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The net effect of this enhanced gene expression is to support both cell cycle progression and Warburg metabolism, which act together to maximize cell growth and proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>c-MYC activity is normally regulated by the amount of MAX available to form MYC-MAX heterodimers and by competition from complexes formed by MAX and other proteins. MAX can form homodimers (MAX-MAX) and other heterodimers with MAD family proteins (ie, MNT and MGA) that can act as negative regulators of transcription and block MYC-dependent transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. It is postulated that MAD-MAX or MNT-MAX heterodimers inhibit c-MYC function, either by sequestering MAX and preventing the formation of <span class=\"nowrap\">MYC/MAX</span> heterodimers, or by competing with <span class=\"nowrap\">MYC/MAX</span> heterodimers for binding to the same target sites. Upregulation of MYC leads to a switch favoring MYC-MAX over MNT-MAX complexes at the promoters of target genes, thereby promoting cell cycle progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Overexpression of MNT inhibits MYC-induced cell cycle entry, consistent with a hypothesis of competitive binding to MAX. In non-Hodgkin lymphomas carrying c-MYC translocations, therefore, it is likely that constitutive expression of c-MYC increases the ratio of <span class=\"nowrap\">MYC/MAX</span> complexes over competitive MAX heterodimers, leading to upregulation of a program of gene expression that promotes growth.</p><p>The role of c-MYC in normal germinal center B cells was initially obscure, as most normal germinal center B cells exhibit low levels of c-MYC expression. However, conditional c-MYC knockout mice have established that c-MYC is essential for the initial proliferative burst that occurs following T cell-dependent antigen-mediated activation of B cells and for the establishment of germinal centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Shortly after entry into germinal centers, antigen-activated B cells downregulate c-MYC, but a subset of cells re-express c-MYC, which may contribute to the process of proliferation-associated somatic hypermutation of germinal center B cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">c-MYC overexpression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BL tumors are characterized by an inappropriately high expression of the c-MYC transcription factor through at least one of the following mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal translocations place the DNA coding sequences for c-MYC under the control of immunoglobulin gene enhancers that are constitutively active in mature B cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5' regulatory regions normally flanking the c-MYC gene body are mutated or moved as a direct result of the translocation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations of the c-MYC gene result in amino acid substitutions that stabilize the c-MYC protein and decrease its proteosome-mediated degradation, thereby increasing its half-life.</p><p/><p>Substantial experimental evidence has shown that constitutive expression of c-MYC influences the growth of B cells in vitro and in vivo, consistent with a role in B cell lymphomagenesis.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'c-MYC in normal cells'</a> above.)</p><p>Although fairly homogeneous at the microscopic level, these translocations display a high degree of molecular heterogeneity. The specific gene breakpoint sites vary not only by translocation but also by clinical context (ie, endemic versus sporadic cases):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The breakpoint sites on chromosome 8 found in t(8;14) are located 5' and centromeric to c-MYC, whereas the sites found in t(2;8) and t(8;22) map 3' to c-MYC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In endemic (African) cases, the breakpoint on chromosome 14 involves the heavy chain joining region, while in non-endemic cases, the translocation involves the heavy chain class-switch region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In endemic cases, the breakpoint in chromosome 8 usually lies adjacent to c-MYC, while in sporadic cases it often lies in intron 1 of the c-MYC gene.</p><p/><p>This molecular heterogeneity precludes the development of sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based testing for these translocations. Instead, these translocations are identified either by karyotyping of metaphase chromosomes or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).</p><p>Work using mouse models has shed light on the possible mechanisms that lead to c-MYC translocations. Translocations involving the class-switch region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and c-MYC occur with surprisingly high frequency in activated B cells undergoing class-switch recombination. These &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; occur during the recombination event that allows B cells to switch from the expression of IgM to the expression of other immunoglobulin types and require the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], which is an essential co-factor for normal class-switch recombination. In further support of a role for AID in chromosomal rearrangements that lead to lymphomagenesis, infection of mice with malaria (a risk factor for human endemic Burkitt lymphoma) provokes sustained expansion of AID-expressing germinal center B cells and increases the development of aggressive B cell lymphomas with chromosomal rearrangements bearing the molecular signatures of AID-mediated DNA damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Other work has shown that c-MYC tends to lie in close proximity to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in the nuclei of B cells, which may explain in part why c-MYC is often involved in such translocations. It is hypothesized that most cells bearing these translocations die rapidly, as unbridled c-MYC expression is a potent inducer of apoptosis (programmed cell death) in normal cells. How BL cells escape this fate is largely unknown; in some tumors, however, loss of p53 function may abrogate c-MYC-induced apoptosis.

Other mechanisms leading to the increased expression of c-MYC include interference with the 5' regulatory regions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stabilization of the protein product.</p><p>5' regulatory regions normally present within the c-MYC DNA sequence can be mutated or moved as a direct result of the translocation. Liberation of c-MYC from normal regulation can result in increased expression. The c-MYC first <span class=\"nowrap\">exon/first</span> intron border, where c-MYC regulatory sequences are located, can be either decapitated by the translocations described in the section above or undergo mutation in translocated alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, the transactivation domain of the c-MYC protein encoded in exon 2 can undergo amino acid substitutions, which interfere with modulation of c-MYC activity by p107 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

Included among these MYC-dependent activities are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased glucose utilization and a switch to so-called Warburg metabolism, in which cells mainly rely on glycolysis for ATP production instead of oxidative phosphorylation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased glutamine metabolism, which creates metabolic intermediates that are needed for membrane biogenesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upregulation of rRNA expression and ribosome biogenesis, leading to increased protein synthesis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other genetic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the presence of c-MYC translocations in the vast majority of BL cases, most tumors contain additional chromosomal abnormalities, the molecular implications of which are poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Of interest, BL cases appear to have fewer additional genetic lesions than DLBCL or unclassifiable aggressive B cell lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Several studies have reported a high frequency of somatic mutations that appear to involve the transcription factor TCF3, its inhibitor ID3, or downstream targets (eg, CCND3):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, high-throughput RNA sequencing and RNA interference screening identified recurrent mutations in components of the p53, cyclin <span class=\"nowrap\">D3/CDK6,</span> PI(3) kinase, and tonic BCR signalling pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-burkitt-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Normally, TCF3 also induces its own inhibitor (ID3), but this negative feedback loop appears to be broken in BL, as the mutations seen in BL appear to activate TCF3 and inactivate ID3. Further study is needed to confirm and further clarify the role of these other pathways in the pathogenesis of BL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12461909\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tumors with c-MYC translocations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other lymphoid tumors may have c-MYC translocations similar or identical to those found in BL, including diffuse large B cell lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and a subset of unclassifiable B cell lymphomas with some features of BL.

Many of these cases may represent &ldquo;transformed&rdquo; follicular lymphomas, in which the c-MYC translocation is acquired as a secondary event.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cell of origin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of BL is dependent upon the constitutive expression of the c-MYC proto-oncogene located at chromosome 8q24, which encodes the c-MYC transcription factor. This transcription factor modulates the expression of target genes that regulate many cellular processes, including cell growth, division, and death. Tumor cells maintain high expression of c-MYC through various mechanisms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chromosomal translocations place the DNA coding sequences for c-MYC under the control of immunoglobulin gene enhancers that are constitutively active in mature B cells. The translocations include: t(8;14), t(2;8), and t(8;22). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Chromosomal translocations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>5' regulatory regions normally present within the c-MYC DNA sequence are mutated or moved as a direct result of the translocation or other mutations of the c-MYC gene result in an increased half-life of its protein product. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Other mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How and why B cells acquire the chromosomal translocations and other genetic changes that result in the increased expression of c-MYC and the resultant development of BL remains incompletely understood, but the inherent genomic instability of germinal center B cells is very likely an important contributing factor. Chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection appears to play a role in virtually all cases of endemic (African) BL and a minority of sporadic and immunodeficiency-associated BL.
