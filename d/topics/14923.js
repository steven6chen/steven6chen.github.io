The term refers to a syndrome in which acute pericarditis recurs after the agent inciting the original acute attack has disappeared or has ceased to be active. </p><p>Recurrent pericarditis, including its definition, proposed pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment, will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with an initial attack of acute pericarditis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical manifestations of acute pericarditis are chest pain, pericardial friction rub, widespread saddle-shaped or concave upward ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG), and pericardial effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At least two of these features should usually be present to make the diagnosis. The clinical manifestations of acute pericarditis are discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Recurrent pericarditis is manifested by recurrence of the symptoms of acute pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64302 \">table 1</a>); however, the predominant feature of recurrent pericarditis is usually chest pain, and other clinical manifestations of acute pericarditis may not be present. The term recurrent pericarditis refers to a syndrome in which acute pericarditis recurs after the agent inciting the original acute attack has disappeared or has ceased to be active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The recurrence of symptoms can be at any point following the prior cessation of acute pericarditis symptoms, but usually occurs weeks to months later. Generally there is an arbitrary defined period of six weeks from the initial or previous attack. Cases with incessant or persistent symptoms within six weeks are considered &quot;incessant pericarditis&quot; rather than &quot;recurrent pericarditis.&quot;</p><p>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">COlchicine</a> for REcurrent pericarditis (CORE) trial, which enrolled 120 patients with recurrent pericarditis to evaluate colchicine therapy, required patients to have both of the following clinical criteria to meet their definition of recurrent pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A documented prior attack of acute pericarditis of idiopathic, viral, or autoimmune origin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of either recurrence or continued activity of pericarditis</p><p/><p>Criteria for the diagnosis of recurrence included recurrent pleuritic type chest pain along with one or more signs of inflammation (ie, fever, pericardial friction rub, electrocardiographic changes, echocardiographic evidence of pericardial effusion, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of inflammation of the pericardium, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevation in the white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein). Such criteria are generally accepted and have been adopted in subsequent studies on acute and recurrent pericarditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27826160\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact recurrence rate after initial attacks of idiopathic pericarditis is unknown, but may be as high as 15 to 30 percent in patients not treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/1,3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,7,8</a>]. Some patients, however, have more persistent pericarditis in which symptoms can only be controlled with steroidal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of recurrent pericarditis are considered to be autoimmune. Evidence supporting an immunopathologic process includes a latent period lasting for months and similarities to other autoimmune conditions including the presence of autoantibodies and responsiveness to glucocorticoid and other immunosuppressive therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. An infectious or systemic etiology cannot usually be identified using standard laboratory techniques without supplementary molecular biology techniques.</p><p>Recurrent pericarditis sometimes shares features of autoinflammatory diseases, a group of inherited diseases affecting the innate immune system and more common in pediatric patients (recurrent fever, serositis, arthralgias, myalgias). On this basis, patients with evidence of systemic inflammation (eg, elevated C-reactive protein) may be eligible to anti-interleukin (IL)-1 therapies after failure of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-involvement-in-systemic-autoimmune-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial involvement in systemic autoimmune diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study of recurrent pericarditis, investigators performed extensive studies to evaluate suspected recurrent pericarditis including pericardioscopy, multiple epicardial biopsies, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Epicardial biopsy was performed during pericardioscopy and targeted at regions that appeared abnormal. The authors reported a higher prevalence of infection or reinfection (approximately 23 percent) than reported in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. In many cases, infection may be missed on routine evaluation and only detected by PCR. These observations suggest that in most cases, recurrences may be due to immune-mediated mechanisms, but sometimes also due to a new infection or reinfection from an infectious agent (generally a virus).</p><p>In some patients with recurrent pericarditis, cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and interferon gamma have been detected in the pericardial fluid but not in sera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This distribution of cytokines suggests a local inflammatory process.</p><p>Familial factors may be important in some cases. A cluster of recurrent pericarditis has been described in five members of a family of German and Danish ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It was suggested that this might represent familial disease with possible autosomal dominant inheritance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possible presenting symptoms of recurrent pericarditis are generally the same as those which may be seen during an initial presentation of acute pericarditis, although the presenting symptoms may not be identical in each individual patient and are frequently less intense during recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Symptoms occur at a variable point in time following the initial attack of pericarditis, though usually within 18 months, and no presenting clinical feature of an initial episode of acute pericarditis reliably predicts recurrence. Though symptoms associated with recurrent pericarditis can be uncomfortable and alter a patient's quality of life, the overall prognosis is generally good, and life-threatening complications (eg, cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis) only rarely develop, although subclinical constrictive physiology may be evident in some patients on echocardiographic examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2801226\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequent symptom of recurrent pericarditis is pleuritic chest pain, which may follow exertion, although some patients may also report dyspnea. Other features, such as pericardial rubs, pericardial effusion, and cardiac tamponade, are less common with subsequent episodes, and cardiac tamponade is a rare complication even in patients who had cardiac tamponade during the initial episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/4,10,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Recurrent pericarditis is not associated with myocardial systolic dysfunction and heart failure symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. Although constrictive pericarditis has been reported in one family cluster with recurrent pericarditis, idiopathic recurrent pericarditis is not usually associated with constrictive pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/10,14,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,16,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2801954\"><span class=\"h2\">Intensity of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The index attack of acute pericarditis is usually more severe than recurrent episodes. In the intermittent form, symptoms begin after a symptom-free interval longer than four to six weeks after drug withdrawal (six weeks being an arbitrarily defined interval) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In incessant forms, recurrent symptoms appear within four to six weeks after drug discontinuation or during attempted weaning. This may be observed following nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, but more commonly following glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2801668\"><span class=\"h2\">Time course and frequency of recurrences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first symptoms of recurrent pericarditis occur at a variable time after the initial attack, but usually within 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19</a>]. Most patients with recurrent pericarditis feel well between attacks, although some patients have a more persistent or chronic course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p>The number of recurrences and the intervals between them vary considerably among patients, with 40 to 50 percent of patients who experience a recurrence having only one to two recurrences, which usually occur over several months to a few years following the initial episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/6,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16,19</a>]. However, some reports have shown that the period of time prior to a recurrence, and the duration of treatment required to effectively treat recurrences, may extend for years or, in rare cases, decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/3,4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,10</a>]. Although not well documented in the literature, the clinical experience of our contributors has been that heavy exertion prior to complete resolution of pericardial inflammation may result in recurrent chest pain. (See <a href=\"#H2234732\" class=\"local\">'Activity restriction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictors of recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No presenting clinical feature of an initial episode of acute pericarditis reliably predicts recurrence. However, a positive response to initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or other NSAID therapy is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence, while initial therapy with a glucocorticoid is associated with a greater risk of recurrence.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with presumed idiopathic acute pericarditis, the response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or other NSAID therapy may identify those at particular risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Compared with responders, those who did not respond to aspirin or other NSAID therapy had a much higher rate of recurrent pericarditis (61 versus 10 percent) and of pericardial constriction (9.1 versus 0.5 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-treatment-and-prognosis#H12602672\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid therapy as the initial treatment for acute pericarditis appears to promote recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The best data come from the COPE trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> therapy in patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis in which glucocorticoids were given only when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> was contraindicated or not tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Glucocorticoid use was a significant predictor of recurrence (odds ratio [OR] 4.3, 95% CI 1.2-15.3), an effect that may be due to promotion of viral replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The COPE trial also showed that colchicine therapy markedly reduces the rate of recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-treatment-and-prognosis#H12602686\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Colchicine'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Similar findings were noted in the CORE trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> therapy in patients with recurrent pericarditis by the same investigators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Previous glucocorticoid use was an independent risk factor for further recurrences (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-8.3). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2235325\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory and diagnostic testing findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the presence of symptoms, results of laboratory studies as well as findings on electrocardiogram (ECG) or other diagnostic testing can be suggestive of pericarditis, though there is not a single test which definitively rules in or out pericarditis. In patients with symptoms suggesting recurrent pericarditis, testing should include an ECG, echocardiogram, and focused laboratory studies searching for evidence of inflammation (ie, white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein [CRP], etc). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging appears to be very sensitive for detecting inflammation of the pericardium and may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2235344\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In recurrent pericarditis, changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG) are less specific than what are reported with the first attack of pericarditis. Only rarely is ST elevation reported, and more commonly findings may include non-specific changes of ST segment and T waves (ie, T wave inversion or flattening). On this basis, it is not possible to describe specific stages of ECG changes such as in acute pericarditis.</p><p>Additional discussion of the variety of ECG changes associated with an initial attack of acute pericarditis is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H2297355\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Electrocardiogram'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2235479\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest radiograph and echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both chest radiograph and echocardiography are often normal in patients with the clinical syndrome of recurrent pericarditis unless there is an associated pericardial effusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2235514\"><span class=\"h3\">Signs of inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since pericarditis is an inflammatory disease, laboratory signs of inflammation are common in patients with recurrent pericarditis. These include elevations in the white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum CRP concentration. While elevation in these markers supports the diagnosis, they are neither sensitive nor specific for recurrent pericarditis. CMR with delayed enhancement using gadolinium is a sensitive method to detect pericardial inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Pericardial disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1751473952\"><span class=\"h3\">Pericardial inflammation by imaging (CT and CMR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In atypical cases, the diagnosis of recurrence can rely on the detection of pericardial inflammation by an imaging technique (eg, contrast-enhanced pericardium by computed tomography [CT] but especially evidence of edema and late gadolinium enhancement of the pericardium by cardiovascular magnetic resonance [CMR]). This approach is supported by a multiple professional societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2802311\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis is usually suspected based on a history of characteristic pleuritic chest pain, particularly in a patient with a known prior episode of acute pericarditis. Recurrent pericarditis may also be suspected in a patient with persistent fever and pericardial effusion or new unexplained cardiomegaly. Additional testing, which typically includes blood work, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography, can support the diagnosis but is frequently normal or unrevealing. The electrocardiogram is usually the most helpful test in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute pericarditis but is often less specific in the diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis. Echocardiography is often normal, but can be an essential part of the evaluation if there is evidence of an associated pericardial effusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of cardiac tamponade. Demonstration of pericardial inflammation by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging may be helpful when there are no other objective data to support recurrent pericarditis in patients who present with recurrent chest pain after experiencing acute pericarditis.</p><p>The approach to the diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis is similar to the approach to the diagnosis of an initial episode of acute pericarditis, which is presented in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of recurrent pericarditis is similar to that of the initial episode of acute pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 2</a>). Most patients with recurrent pericarditis can be managed effectively with medical therapy alone, and outpatient management is feasible in almost all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/6,11,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,19</a>]. Hospitalization should be limited to patients with high-risk features as in acute pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We recommend combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> plus a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for initial therapy of recurrent pericarditis due to idiopathic or viral causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In patients with another identified cause, specific therapy appropriate to the underlying disorder is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Colchicine'</a> below.)</p><p>The vast majority of patients will also respond to glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>), initially given in a high dose, which is maintained for a short period and subsequently tapered. However, prolonged or frequent administration may be necessary, possibly leading to serious complications. In addition, glucocorticoid therapy may increase the rate of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/6,8,20,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,20,23-25</a>] even after multiple recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As a result, we limit the use of glucocorticoids for recurrent pericarditis to specific patients who are unable to tolerate NSAID therapy or who have failed multiple courses of NSAID therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p>Corticosteroids are contraindicated as first choice unless there are specific indications (eg, systemic inflammatory disease on steroids, pregnancy after week 20). Such an approach is consistent with 2015 ESC guidelines.</p><p>In patients who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or an NSAID plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, a combination of different drugs should be considered (aspirin or an NSAID plus low-dose corticosteroids plus colchicine).</p><p>In patients not responding to such therapies, additional options include: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, human intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), or anti-interleukin-1 agents.

Because of this and the need to maintain compliance, effective communication with the patient is important. It is important to explain to the patient the nature of the disease, the likely course, and the treatment alternatives. Specific features of the disease that should be emphasized include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After successful treatment of a recurrence, further recurrences are possible, and may repeat, at variable intervals, for up to several years.

Such therapy may be considered as a last resort in cases with severe side effects related to systemic use. However, in our view, the utility of such an approach requires further investigation.</p><p>In a review of 84 patients with recurrent or persistent autoreactive pericarditis with effusion, pericardiocentesis with antibiotic prophylaxis was followed by intrapericardial administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> (300 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> given in 100 mL of isotonic saline at body temperature) as a single injection and then removed at 24 hours; maintenance therapy consisted of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> (0.5 mg three times daily) for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This regimen led to symptomatic improvement and prevented recurrence in 90 percent of patients at three months and 84 percent at one year.

If the patient has a large or moderate sized pericardial effusion, intrapericardial therapy is straightforward. This is usually accomplished via intrapericardial catheter following drainage of the pericardial effusion. If the patient has a small, or no pericardial effusion, pericardioscopy must be performed to utilize this form of treatment.

However, 20 of 21 patients receiving anakinra experienced a side effect (primarily local skin reactions, although herpes zoster, increase liver transaminases, and optic neuropathy were also reported), compared with none of the patients receiving placebo.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with delayed enhancement may be considered if the diagnosis remains uncertain after the above testing, as it is highly sensitive for pericardial inflammation.

A common belief is that the risk of constrictive pericarditis may be related to the number of recurrences, although it has been well demonstrated that the risk is essentially related to the etiology: high risk for bacterial pericarditis (tuberculous and purulent), intermediate risk for immune-mediated and neoplastic pericarditis, low risk for viral pericarditis, and it has never been reported in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-pericarditis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>However, quality of life can be severely affected in patients with repeated recurrences or incessant pericarditis and glucocorticoid dependence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3042773425\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The recurrence of symptoms can be at any point following the prior cessation of acute pericarditis symptoms, but usually occurs weeks to months later. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most instances, recurrent pericarditis is considered to be an autoimmune process, although viral infections may play a role (chronic infection, reinfection, new viral infection). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presenting symptoms of recurrent pericarditis are generally the same as those which may be seen during an initial presentation of acute pericarditis, although the presenting symptoms may not be identical in each individual patient and are frequently less intense during recurrences. The most frequent symptom of recurrent pericarditis is pleuritic chest pain. (See <a href=\"#H2801226\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the presence of symptoms, results of laboratory studies, as well as findings on electrocardiogram (ECG) or other diagnostic testing, can be suggestive of pericarditis, though there is not a single test which definitively rules in or out pericarditis. In patients with symptoms suggesting recurrent pericarditis, testing should include an ECG, echocardiogram, and focused laboratory studies searching for evidence of inflammation (ie, white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, etc). Cardiac MRI appears to be a promising method to detect pericardial inflammation, but needs more clinical investigations to know its incremental clinical value in this condition. (See <a href=\"#H2235325\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and diagnostic testing findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes on the ECG which are suggestive of recurrent pericarditis mimic those seen in acute pericarditis and most commonly include widespread ST segment elevation with PR depression, although diffuse T wave inversions may also be seen as part of the evolution of the ECG changes. (See <a href=\"#H2235344\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis is usually suspected based on a history of characteristic pleuritic chest pain, particularly in a patient with a known prior episode of acute pericarditis. The ECG is usually the most helpful test in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute pericarditis but is often less specific in the diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis. (See <a href=\"#H2802311\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with recurrent pericarditis, which is felt to be idiopathic, viral, or autoimmune in origin, we recommend combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> plus a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) rather than NSAIDs alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We generally administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> plus colchicine, although acceptable alternatives are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus colchicine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> plus colchicine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 2</a>). The duration of therapy (usually at least one month) guided by the persistence of symptoms and the normalization of inflammatory biomarkers. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strenuous physical activity may trigger worsening of symptoms; therefore, such activity should be avoided until symptom resolution. (See <a href=\"#H2234732\" class=\"local\">'Activity restriction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid therapy should generally be avoided in patients with recurrent pericarditis given the potential adverse effects and risk of increasing the likelihood of further recurrences. Glucocorticoids may be considered in patients who fail combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> and an NSAID, patients with definite rheumatologic disease, and patients with intolerance or contraindications to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or NSAID use. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require glucocorticoid therapy for recurrent pericarditis, we suggest the use of moderate initial dosing (eg, 0.25 to 0.50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) followed by a slow taper (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 2</a>) rather than high doses with a rapid taper (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H172171\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to glucocorticoid use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrapericardial steroid therapy, immunosuppression, and pericardiectomy are therapeutic options for those with continued recurrences or pericarditis which is refractory to standard medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Intrapericardial steroids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Other immune therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Role of pericardiectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with recurrent pericarditis are well between attacks, and the overall prognosis in patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis is excellent, with only a minority of patients having a more persistent or chronic course or developing complications such as constrictive pericarditis.
