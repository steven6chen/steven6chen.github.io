It is an incurable disease and the cause of about 20 percent of deaths from hematologic malignancy and 2 percent of deaths from all cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>MM is thought to evolve from an asymptomatic pre-malignant stage of clonal plasma cell proliferation termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is present in over 3 percent of the population above the age of 50, and progresses to myeloma or a related malignancy at a rate of 1 percent per year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While MGUS is asymptomatic, MM is characterized by end organ damage, which includes hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, or lytic bone lesions. In some patients, an intermediate asymptomatic but more advanced pre-malignant stage referred to as smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) can be recognized clinically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathobiology of MM will be reviewed here. The clinical and laboratory manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of MM are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CELL OF ORIGIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple myeloma (MM) appears to arise from the malignant transformation of post-germinal center plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The post-germinal ancestry of these cells is principally supported by the identification of somatic mutations in the variable region of the immunoglobulin genes, which serve as a marker of germinal center transit. These cells also display ongoing somatic mutations, which reflect the pressure of antigen selection encountered by post-germinal center lymphocytes. By definition, class switching is demonstrated in IgG and IgA MM, but not in IgM MM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;, section on 'Immunoglobulin class-switching'</a>.)</p><p>The malignant plasma cells of MM have a low proliferative rate and have generally been unable to sustain tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that precursor cells are responsible for proliferation of the malignant cell population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. It has been proposed that these abnormal precursor B-cells originate in the lymph nodes and migrate to the bone marrow, which provides a microenvironment conducive to terminal plasma cell differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This could explain the observation that the malignant plasma cells appear to be restricted to the microenvironment of the bone marrow, even though the disease is widely disseminated throughout the axial skeleton. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow microenvironment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathobiology of multiple myeloma (MM) is a complex process leading to the replication of a malignant clone of plasma cell origin. While some steps in this pathway have been elucidated, many remain unknown. Virtually all MM cases are preceded by a premalignant plasma cell proliferative disorder known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. MGUS is present in over 3 percent of the population above the age of 50, and progresses to myeloma or a related malignancy at a rate of 1 percent per year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of MM can be conceptualized as two sequential processes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78232\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78232 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishment of MGUS &ndash; While the inciting event is unknown, MGUS appears to develop as the result of cytogenetic abnormalities, many of which are thought to be the product of an abnormal plasma cell response to antigenic stimulation. The result is a plasma cell clone producing monoclonal immunoglobulin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progression from MGUS to MM &ndash; Further insults to the plasma cell clone, either through additional genetic abnormalities or changes in the bone marrow microenvironment, result in the progression of MGUS to MM.</p><p/><p>In some patients, an intermediate asymptomatic but more advanced pre-malignant stage referred to as smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) can be recognized clinically. These patients may have been diagnosed in the midst of progressing from MGUS to MM, or may represent biologic MGUS with a higher baseline clonal plasma cell burden.</p><p>Once the clonal plasma cell population is created and progresses to MM, patients develop symptoms (eg, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, renal dysfunction, and anemia) related to the infiltration of plasma cells into the bone or other organs or to kidney damage from excess light chains. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTABLISHMENT OF MGUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the pathway to the development of multiple myeloma (MM) is the establishment of the premalignant plasma cell proliferative disorder known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Patient-related and environmental risk factors for MGUS have been proposed, but the exact cause of MGUS development remains elusive.</p><p>Similar patterns of certain cytogenetic abnormalities can be found in the clonal plasma cells of MGUS and MM. These cytogenetic abnormalities (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cytogenetic abnormalities'</a> below) are thought to lead to the creation of a plasma cell clone. While the event leading to these genetic changes likely varies, the most likely process is abnormal plasma cell response to antigenic stimulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic data suggest a genetic predisposition as well as other potential risk factors including older age, immunosuppression, and environmental exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Hormonal factors may play a role, since women have significantly lower age-specific prevalence rates when compared with men.</p><p>A genetic predisposition is predominantly supported by the findings that the incidence of MGUS varies by ethnicity and that a small, but unknown, fraction of cases are familial. Such cases may be due to either shared genes or environmental factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Exposure to radiation, benzene, and other organic solvents, herbicides, and insecticides may also play a role. However, the number of cases reported for each of these risk factors is small. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data regarding the risk of MM among atomic bomb survivors are mixed. Some studies note that an increased risk of MM is found in atomic bomb survivors exposed to more than 50 rad, those &lt;20 years of age, and those in close proximity to the bomb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], while others have concluded that there was little evidence of an increased risk of MM after atomic bomb exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiologists exposed to large doses of long-term radiation have an increased risk of MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Workers in nuclear plants and farmers who use herbicides and insecticides and those who employ benzene and petroleum products may have increased rates of MM, but the evidence is not compelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p>While further data are necessary for a definitive statement regarding these risk factors, it is prudent to limit exposure to these agents for this and other reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytogenetic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary cytogenetic abnormalities appear to play a major role in the development of MGUS. Most, if not all, cases of MGUS and MM have chromosomal abnormalities that can be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), multicolor spectral karyotyping, comparative genomic hybridization, or gene expression profiling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. The percentage of cases demonstrating each abnormality varies by the detection method used and disease stage. Most cases of MGUS appear to be initiated in conjunction with either translocation events involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus (approximately 40 percent) or genetic instability manifested by trisomies (approximately 40 percent) or both translocations and trisomies (approximately 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunoglobulin heavy chain translocations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial immune response (primary immune response) results in formation of IgM antibodies targeting the offending antigen. When exposed to the same antigen again, there may be a &quot;class switch&quot; that occurs wherein the genes coding for the variable portion of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) switch from the gene coding for the constant region of IgM to move next to the gene coding for the constant region of IgG (or IgA). This is termed &quot;switch recombination&quot; or &quot;class switching,&quot; as a result of which the antibody made by the plasma cell changes from IgM type to IgG or IgA (secondary immune response). Approximately half of MGUS cases are likely caused by translocation events (errors) that occur at the time of immunoglobulin switch recombination. These translocations affect the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus on chromosome 14q32, and result in the juxtaposition of an oncogene next to the IgH locus. This results in the aberrant expression of the affected oncogene and is thought to be a critical step in the development of MGUS. Cases that include these rearrangements are referred to as IgH translocated MGUS or non-hyperdiploid MGUS. The most common partner chromosome loci and genes dysregulated in these translocations are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52114\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52114 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>11q13 &ndash; cyclin D1 gene</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>6p21 &ndash; cyclin D3 gene</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4p16.3 &ndash; multiple myeloma set domain (MMSET)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>16q23 &ndash; musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (c-maf)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>20q11 &ndash; musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncology family, protein B (mafB)</p><p/><p>The juxtaposition of these oncogenes next to the IgH locus results in overexpression of the oncogene induced by the active promoter region of the IgH genes. The products of this translocation then act as transcription factors, growth factor receptors, and cell cycle mediators to promote growth and replication. This process establishes the MGUS clone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;, section on 'Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Cyclin D1 expression'</a>.)</p><p>The percentage of cases displaying IgH translocations increases as the disease progresses from MGUS to MM. IgH translocations are found in nearly 50 percent of patients with MGUS or smoldering MM, 55 to 73 percent of those with MM, 85 percent of plasma cell leukemias, and &gt;90 percent of in vitro human myeloma cell lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. This may reflect the fact that certain types of IgH translocated MGUS and MM (eg, t14;16, t14;20) may be more aggressive than the hyperdiploid type of MGUS (see below)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Trisomies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of MGUS cases that do not have translocations involving IgH demonstrate genetic instability manifested by the presence of trisomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/20,26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26-31</a>]. This subset of MGUS is referred to as IgH non-translocated MGUS or hyperdiploid MGUS. Hyperdiploidy refers to the gain of numerous chromosomes (trisomies) in the clonal cell population. Hyperdiploidy in MM typically involves one or more odd numbered chromosomes, with the exception of chromosomes 1, 13, and 21. Hyperdiploidy can result in the overexpression of genes located on the affected chromosomes. These genes may promote growth and replication leading to the MGUS clone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Aberrant response to antigenic stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The events that trigger the cytogenetic abnormalities described above are not known, but it is felt that the trigger for such changes is related to antigenic stimulation. The nature of the antigenic stimulus is unknown and likely differs between cases. As an example, one study found that a high percentage of patients (17 of 20 patients) with Gaucher disease-associated MM had monoclonal immunoglobulins with reactivity against the lysolipid LGL-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In contrast, monoclonal immunoglobulins with reactivity against LGL-1 or another lysolipid, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), were found in only a minority of patients with sporadic MM (22 of 66 patients). &#160; </p><p>The reason why an antigenic stimulus produces an abnormal, sustained, proliferative signal for plasma cells is unclear. Nevertheless, the increase in the proliferative rate of these plasma cells then increases the risk for chromosomal damage that evades the standard repair mechanisms. The resultant chromosomal changes are then thought to lead to the creation of a plasma cell clone responsible for the overproduction of a single type of immunoglobulin. It is this monoclonal immunoglobulin that is detected and identifies MGUS as an entity. Potential mechanisms for this enhanced response to <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/exposure</span> include the abnormal expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and overexpression of IL-6 receptors in plasma cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Toll like receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are molecules on the cell surface that detect and respond to microbial infection. They are a component of our non-specific or &quot;innate&quot; immune defense and act as receptors that recognize molecular patterns on antigens. The ligands for these receptors are components of pathogenic microbes and are often called &quot;pathogen-associated molecular patterns&quot; (PAMPs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toll-like receptors: Roles in disease and therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In vitro studies show that human myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells express a broad range of TLRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

IL-6 appears to be required for the survival of myeloma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p>When compared with normal plasma cells, plasma cells in MGUS demonstrate overexpression of the IL-6 receptor alpha-chain (CD126) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. In vitro studies have demonstrated that inhibition of IL-6 stops myeloma cell lines from proliferating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>].</p><p>In vivo, IL-6 is produced by the bone marrow microenvironment and acts in a paracrine fashion to stimulate plasma cells. Adhesion of plasma cells to the bone marrow stroma also appears to trigger IL-6 secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The sequence of events associated with IL-6 overexpression is not clear. IL-6 stimulation of plasma cells results in the upregulation of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, factors that enhance plasma cell survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

MGUS progresses to symptomatic MM at a consistent annual rate suggesting that this progression may be explained by a &quot;random second hit&quot; model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The risk of progression is similar regardless of the known duration of antecedent MGUS, suggesting that the second-hit responsible for progression is a random event, not cumulative damage.

The role of angiogenesis in disease progression is suggested by observations that demonstration of angiogenesis in cases of solitary plasmacytoma at the time of diagnosis predicts progression to myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Further, there is a gradual increase in the degree of bone marrow angiogenesis along the disease spectrum from MGUS to smoldering myeloma (SMM) to symptomatic myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. In one study, approximately 60 percent of myeloma bone marrow plasma samples stimulated angiogenesis in an in vitro angiogenesis assay, compared with zero percent of SMM and 7 percent of MGUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Increased angiogenesis in MM is correlated with disease activity, bone marrow plasma cell involvement, and plasma cell proliferative capacity.</p><p>The increased angiogenesis seen in MM may be related to the expression of pro-angiogenic cytokines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a loss of angiogenesis inhibitor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>]. As an example, an in vitro study of angiogenesis demonstrated that a significantly higher percentage of bone marrow plasma samples from patients with MGUS inhibited angiogenesis when compared with samples from patients with SMM or MM (63, 43, and 4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12782145\"><span class=\"h3\">Clonal heterogeneity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies indicate the existence of multiple subclones at the time of diagnosis of myeloma.

With therapy, the dominant clone may be nearly eradicated, while at relapse a new subclone with different response characteristics may emerge as the dominant clone.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteolytic bone lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteolytic bone lesions are the hallmark of MM. Although there are some data suggesting abnormalities in bone metabolism in MGUS, the presence of osteolytic bone lesions signals the onset of active malignancy. The pathogenesis of lytic bone lesions characteristic of MM is currently thought to be mediated by an imbalance between the activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. This imbalance is caused both by enhanced osteoclastic activity as well as (in contrast to other malignancies) a marked suppression of osteoblastic activity. As a result, MM bone lesions tend to be purely osteolytic and better visualized on plain radiographs compared with other bone metastases from solid tumors that tend to have an osteoblastic component and are better visualized on radionucleotide bone scans.</p><p>Increased osteolytic activity is mediated by an increase in RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand) expression by osteoblasts (and possibly plasma cells) accompanied by a reduction in the level of its decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. This leads to an increase in <span class=\"nowrap\">RANKL/OPG</span> ratio, which causes osteoclast activation and bone resorption. Increased levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1alpha, CCL3), IL-3, and IL-6 produced by marrow stromal cells also contribute to the overactivity of osteoclasts. Finally, there is increased expression of stromal derived factor 1&alpha; (SDF-1alpha) by stromal cells and myeloma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. SDF-1alpha causes osteoclast activation by binding to CXCR4 on osteoclast precursors.</p><p>In addition to osteoclast activation, there is active suppression of osteoblasts in myeloma. This is most likely related to increased levels of IL-3, IL-7, and dickkopf 1 (DKK1), which inhibit osteoblast differentiation in MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. MM cells express DKK1, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, and increased expression of DKK1 by these cells has been associated with presence of focal bone lesions in MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Increased IL-3 and IL-7 levels may also play a role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypercalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypercalcemia appears to be a product of osteoclast activating factors such as lymphotoxin, interleukin-6, hepatocyte growth factor, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANK ligand). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypercalcemia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypercalcemia&quot;, section on 'Malignancy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal involvement in MM is usually the result of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains. However, in rare occasions, monoclonal heavy chains or the entire immunoglobulins may be involved. Non-monoclonal protein-related renal injury may also occur.

Importantly, the bone marrow of patients with MM contains lower than normal numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. This reduction in hematopoietic precursors appears to be at least partially due to changes in the bone marrow microenvironment.
