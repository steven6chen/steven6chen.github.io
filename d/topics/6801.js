As an example, a clinician may become concerned that a child has been sexually abused because of an unusual injury pattern or behavior identified at the time of a scheduled visit. Alternatively, an evaluation in the emergency department may be initiated when a child is injured or discloses an incident to a caregiver. Specific interviewing skills, evidence-collection procedures, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> specialized examination techniques may be required to perform a thorough evaluation.</p><p>The epidemiology, evaluation, and differential diagnosis of sexual abuse in children and adolescents will be reviewed here. The management and sequelae of childhood sexual abuse and human trafficking, including sex trafficking, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and sequelae of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human trafficking: Identification and evaluation in the health care setting&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual assault is defined as attempted sexual touching of another person without their consent and includes sexual intercourse (rape), sodomy (oral-genital or anal-genital contact), and fondling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A generally accepted definition of sexual abuse is when a child engages in sexual activity for which <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> cannot give consent, is unprepared for developmentally, cannot comprehend, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an activity that violates the law or social taboos of society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This includes fondling and all forms of oral-genital, genital, or anal contact with the child (whether the victim is clothed or unclothed), as well as non-touching abuses such as exhibitionism, voyeurism, or involving the child in pornography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Thus, child sexual abuse can include acts that would be considered sexual assault. For purposes of this chapter the term sexual abuse will be used, indicating that the perpetrator is a person of such acts is also responsible for the child's health and welfare.</p><p>It is important to distinguish between sexual abuse and &quot;sexual play&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Sexual abuse occurs when there is asymmetry in age or development among the participants, with a coercive quality to the event.</p><p>&quot;Sexual play&quot; occurs in the absence of coercion and involves children of the same age (separated by no more than four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]) or developmental level who engage in viewing or touching each other's genitalia because of mutual interest or curiosity. Sexual play is considered normal behavior and does not have the psychological, developmental, or physical consequences of sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition to sexual play, many preschool-aged children mimic behaviors of older family members, such as flirting, batting eyelids, and &quot;walking sexy.&quot; This behavior also is considered part of normal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Department of Health and Human Services reports that &gt;60,000 children are sexually abused annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Each year approximately 1 percent of children experience some form of sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Worldwide, an estimated 25 percent of girls and 9 percent of boys are exposed to any form of sexual abuse during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The number of reported sexual abuse grossly underestimates the true prevalence. Comparison of the prevalence of substantiated sexual abuse in developed countries (United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia), as determined by agency reports, with self-reported sexual abuse by parents or victims who reside in these countries, suggests that only one in 10 instances of sexual abuse comes to official attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One United States survey found that 20 percent of high school students experienced sexual assault, but only 50 percent of these students revealed the incident to someone else [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Reasons that these events go unreported include fear of the medical evaluation, social stigma, and desire for privacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Sexual abuse of children occurs primarily in the preadolescent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Girls are more likely than boys to be sexually abused; however, boys are less likely to report sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Perpetrators of sexual abuse are usually male, and often trusted adult acquaintances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,15</a>]. Statistics from reported cases in the United States indicate that &quot;father&quot; and &quot;other relatives&quot; were responsible for 21 and 19 percent of sexual abuse victims, respectively; mothers acting alone or with another person accounted for 4 and 8 percent of perpetrators, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Perpetrators report that they gained access to children through caretaking (eg, babysitting), that they targeted children using bribes, gifts, and games, and systematically desensitized children through touch, talk about sex, and persuasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Victims of sexual abuse include children from all social, cultural, and economic backgrounds. However, some features related to family structure and parenting have been associated with an increased risk of childhood sexual abuse; the increased risk associated with these features is small, and their absence in no way precludes sexual abuse as a possibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These features include poor parent-child relationships, poor relationships between parents, the absence of a protective parent, and the presence of a nonbiologically related male in the home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Victims of sexual abuse may present with a variety of medical complaints. They may be brought to medical attention specifically for evaluation of possible sexual abuse, or they may present for routine care or acute evaluation of medical or behavioral concerns that are not obviously related to the abuse. In the latter scenarios, the diagnosis of sexual abuse depends, to some extent, upon the willingness of the evaluating physician to consider it as a possibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Most of the complaints that are possible indicators of sexual abuse are nonspecific (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65874 \">table 1</a>). Those that are more specific for inappropriate sexual contact or exposure include rectal or genital bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that were not acquired perinatally.</p><p>Behaviors that may indicate that a child has been sexually abused include perpetration of sexual abuse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexually explicit acting out, developmentally inappropriate knowledge of sexual activities, or developmentally inappropriate play (such as repeatedly touching an adult's genitals or asking an adult to touch the child's genitals). Such behaviors are learned and are not a normal part of childhood fantasy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical evaluation of childhood sexual abuse has several immediate goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To identify injuries or other conditions that require treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To screen for or diagnose sexually transmitted infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To evaluate for, and if possible, reduce the risk of pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To document findings of potential forensic value.</p><p/><p>The evaluation for possible sexual abuse includes a history and physical examination and may include forensic evidence collection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> screening for sexually transmitted infections. Whenever possible, the evaluation should be performed by an experienced child abuse team, including a child abuse specialist or clinician with similar experience. Consultation with a regional child abuse specialist or assessment center may also be helpful in difficult cases, or in cases that occur in the context of other family problems such as family violence or substance abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Resources'</a> below.)</p><p>Sexual abuse evaluations are best performed in a non-emergent setting, such as a child abuse advocacy center, where the history and physical examination can be performed in a calm, quiet environment and proceed at a pace tailored to the victim&rsquo;s needs.</p><p>Urgent evaluation is necessary under the following circumstances and typically occurs in an emergent setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,13,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The alleged abuse occurred within 72 to 96 hours, depending upon jurisdiction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are genital or anal injuries that require treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is obvious forensic evidence on the patient&rsquo;s clothes or body that must be collected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is danger of continued abuse or reprisal by the alleged perpetrator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The victim has reported homicidal or suicidal ideation or other emergent complaints.</p><p/><p>In all other cases, an evaluation by an experienced child abuse team, if available, and in a setting that is not emergent should be scheduled as soon as possible after the alleged incident or disclosure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>]. In addition to an evaluation for sexual abuse, it is essential that each child receives a thorough general medical assessment that may identify unmet medical and psychological needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining an unbiased history from a child who may have been sexually abused may be the most important part of the evaluation, particularly since diagnostic physical findings are frequently absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,13,20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,20,25</a>]. A history of sexual abuse that is obtained in the course of medical diagnosis and treatment may be admissible in court as an exception to the laws restricting hearsay testimony. Thus, complete (verbatim, if possible) documentation of questions and answers is critical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26</a>].

The review of systems should identify changes in bowel or bladder habits (such as enuresis or encopresis), sleep disturbances, and behavioral changes and when they were first noted. Sexual abuse often triggers these symptoms.</p><p>Parents should be asked how the abuse came to light or, if the child has not disclosed abuse, why the parents suspect it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Investigative interviews should be performed by the appropriate agencies, and if possible, by forensic interviewers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. This minimizes the need for a child to relate painful and distressing information on multiple occasions and also reduces bias that may be introduced by repeated, suggestive, or leading questions.</p><p>In cases where sexual abuse is suspected, but not yet disclosed, the evaluating physician must obtain additional information from the caregiver. Child Protective Services should intervene to determine the need for a trained forensic interviewer when there is reasonable concern that abuse has occurred.</p><p>During the evaluation of child sexual abuse cases, the role of each clinician should be clearly defined and based on clinical expertise. As an example, a clinical assistant who is handling laboratory specimens should not ask the child or family about the details of the abuse. In the situation where the clinician must obtain a history of abuse from the child, he or she must remember that this should be an opportunity for the patient to tell the story without guidance or prompting from the parent or examiner.</p><p>The following section outlines a common approach taken by trained interviewers when questioning a child or adolescent who has been sexually abused.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children</strong> &ndash; Children should be interviewed without the parents present, if at all possible. However, when the child is uncomfortable alone with the examiner, it may be more effective to permit the parent to stay. The examiner should explain to the parent the importance of obtaining the history in the child's own words. The presence of a parent can be an opportunity to observe parent-child interaction. Although there is no consensus regarding the necessity of a chaperone for the interview, we suggest that it be conducted with either the parent or a Child Life worker in the room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to obtaining the patient history, the clinician should explain the reason for the visit and describe the examination that may follow. As rapport is established, it is important to determine what words the child uses to describe his or her body parts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The accuracy of the history may be improved by asking open-ended questions, such as &quot;Has someone ever touched you in a way you didn't like or that made you feel uncomfortable?&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. To encourage a spontaneous narrative, the examiner should avoid any display of shock or disbelief, and maintain a &quot;Tell me more.&quot; or &quot;And then what happened?&quot; approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When an incident is disclosed, the following information must be obtained with a gentle and non-threatening manner, using language that the child can understand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Who was the person who did this?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With what part of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> body?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What part(s) of the patient's body was (were) touched?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>How many times was the child touched?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When was the last time that it happened?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At what location did the abuse occur?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Was there any exposure to blood or body fluids?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Did the child experience pain to the affected body part?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For male assailants, was there ejaculation?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Did the child tell anyone about the incident?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Leading and suggestive questions (such as, &quot;Mr. X touched your bottom, didn't he?&quot; or &quot;Did Mr. X touch your bottom?&quot;) should be avoided. Allowing the child to use a doll or drawing to describe what happened may be helpful in obtaining and clarifying information. The patient may disclose more details during the course of the physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">At the end of the history, it is important that the child understands that he or she did the right thing in telling what happened, that he or she did nothing wrong, and that he or she is not in trouble [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The examination is important for assessing medical problems that require attention, but other aspects of the evaluation (eg, history, laboratory analysis) may be more helpful in determining whether the child has been abused.

Recognizing that the physical examination may be emotionally difficult for the child, permitting the child to decide who he or she would prefer to have in the examination room is one way to empower him or her. Distraction techniques may help the child tolerate the uncomfortable nature of the evaluation.

Every institution that provides care to victims of alleged sexual abuse must have an organized approach to the collection of forensic evidence. Many states have developed the Sexual Assault Nurse Evaluator (SANE) system, which utilizes specially trained nurse examiners for evidence collection from adults and children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims&quot;, section on 'Trained providers'</a>.)</p><p>The use of SANEs in the pediatric emergency department setting may improve the medical care of children and adolescents who have been sexually abused; it has been demonstrated that such patients are more likely to have documentation of ano-genital injury, more appropriate testing for STIs and pregnancy when indicated, and more referrals for mental health services when SANEs are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].

Several retrospective series have demonstrated that the yield for forensic examinations in children is low and that the majority of forensic evidence is found on clothing and linens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. However, more recent evidence suggests that DNA can be recovered from body swabs of prepubertal children even after 24 hours has elapsed since the assault and that recovery of evidence was not correlated with physical findings or laboratory evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Thus, the risks and benefits of forensic evidence collection should be weighed carefully in each case, especially in prepubertal children. Arrangements should be made such that the most experienced examiner collects forensic evidence in a manner and setting that is emotionally supportive for the child and adolescent and family.</p><p>The decision to collect forensic evidence from children who may have been sexually abused should take into consideration state protocols, the probability that the examination will yield evidence, and the potential emotional impact of the collection procedure on the child. Whenever possible, the decision to perform a forensic examination should be made by individuals with training and experience in child sexual abuse.</p><p>Careful documentation of the decision making process regarding evidence collection is essential. Reasons for not collecting evidence or modifying the type of evidence that is collected must be documented. Information should be included regarding the emotional needs of the child and details of the abuse that are likely to decrease the yield of evidence (such as the use of condoms, lubricant, or showering or bathing prior to the examination).</p><p>For prepubertal children and adolescents who are evaluated within 24 hours of the alleged abuse, forensic evidence should generally be collected in any of the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is reasonable concern that sexual abuse has occurred.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child has a genital injury as the result of alleged sexual abuse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clothing or linen associated with the abuse is available.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are other concerning clinical features.</p><p/><p>For children who are evaluated more than 24 hours after the incident, protocols of the local jurisdiction should be followed, recognizing that the yield in evidence collection often decreases after 24 hours. The clinician must also consider that evidence may be identified that was unanticipated by the child's history or general physical examination and that there are reported instances of collection of identifiable DNA samples beyond 24 hours in young children under 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/53,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56,57</a>].</p><p>Although limited data suggest that the yield of evidentiary exams after 24 hours is also low for adolescents, patients in this age group are usually managed according to adult protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/48,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,52</a>].

Aspects of the examination itself that should be considered include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DNA evidence may be identified from sources other than semen.
