This mutagenic progression, called multistep carcinogenesis, parallels the genetic model of colorectal carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Within many of these regions of recurring chromosomal abnormality, candidate oncogenes or tumor suppressors have since been identified, some of which appear to play critical roles in carcinogenic transformation. Subsequent detailed progression models for carcinogenesis of the head and neck have been based upon mutational models and differential gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. More recently, we have a better understanding of the mutational landscape in HNSCC from newer sequencing technologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. </p><p>Identification of some of the critical genetic events leading to head and neck cancer has clarified the molecular basis for epidemiologic observations regarding risk factors (eg, tobacco), has identified previously unknown risk factors (eg, human papillomavirus [HPV] infection), and is yielding information that may be critical for risk stratification.

The grossly normal epithelium adjacent to the cancer in this study frequently contained dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive carcinoma, as though the entire mucosal field had been damaged and preconditioned by a carcinogen.</p><p>The molecular basis for field cancerization has been studied by evaluating matched dysplastic and malignant lesions within the oral cavity for genetic alterations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Two important observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four of the 15 dysplastic lesions harbored the same genetic abnormalities detected in the tumor. The finding of identical genetic lesions in dysplastic lesions and invasive cancer in the same patient provided further evidence that dysplasias were precursor lesions and that multiple lesions can arise due to the lateral migration of genetically altered cells through the oral mucosa (a phenomenon termed clonal cancerization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eight of the 15 dysplastic lesions showed genetic alterations not found in the matched cancer. This provided evidence that multifocal disease can arise from the development of several genetically altered clones from different initiating events.</p><p/><p>The importance of dysplastic lesions as precursors to malignancy was illustrated in a retrospective study of 97 cases of epithelial dysplasia in the head and neck region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Fifty patients developed a squamous cell carcinoma in the same area as the dysplastic lesion at a mean follow-up of 30 months.</p><p>Support for field cancerization is also provided by the development of second or multiple primaries in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer at one site in the head and neck is a strong predictor for the development of a second primary tumor elsewhere. Second tumors can either occur at or close to the same time as the primary lesion (synchronous), or at least six months later (metachronous). As with dysplasia, the second tumors may be clonally similar to or distinct from the primary tumor.

Although the specific sequence of genetic events has not been defined, numerous molecular mutations and genetic alterations have been found in both carcinomas and premalignant tissue.</p><p>A large number of studies examining chromosomal abnormalities in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) serve as the foundation for current models of squamous cell carcinogenesis and indicate the complexity of the transformation process. Cytogenetic analysis and more detailed loss of heterozygosity studies based upon microsatellite analysis have demonstrated that particular chromosomal abnormalities are consistently observed in HNSCC. Among many others, regions found to be commonly lost include 9p21 (the site of the p16 <em>CDKN2A</em> and p14 <em>ARF</em> tumor suppressor genes), 9p34 (<em>NOTCH1</em> tumor suppressor or oncogene) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], 17p13 (site of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and perhaps another tumor suppressor that remains to be identified), 11p15 (<em>HRAS</em> oncogene) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], 3q26 (<em>PIK3CA</em> oncogene) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], 3p (the site of potential tumor suppressor genes, including <em>FHIT</em> and <em>RASSF1A</em>), 13q21 (unknown tumor suppressor near the retinoblastoma locus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/6,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16,17</a>], and 18q21 (the site of the <em>DCC</em> gene) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>One study performed microsatellite analysis on a series of hyperplastic lesions, dysplastic lesions, carcinomas in situ, and invasive squamous cell carcinomas, examining these and other chromosomal loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The findings generated the first model of sequential genetic progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinogenesis, as illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79860\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79860 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of 9p, leading to inactivation of the p16 tumor suppressor gene, was a very early event, occurring even in transition from normal to hyperplastic mucosa.

Among other putative tumor suppressors, 17p includes the p53 gene. The transition from dysplasia to carcinoma in situ was frequently associated with specific additional losses (11q, 13q, 14q) and still others (6p, 8, 4q) in the transition to invasive squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite early loss of 17p in this model, sequencing of p53 alleles indicated that loss of p53 function may occur significantly later in the course of malignant transformation.</p><p/><p>These data were confirmed and extended by using comparative genomic hybridization, a relatively new technique that permits concurrent analysis of genetic gain and loss throughout the genome. When well-differentiated and poorly differentiated HNSCC were evaluated by this technique, there was evidence of genetic progression from well to poorly differentiated cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well-differentiated tumors consistently demonstrated underrepresentation (loss) of chromosomes 3p, 5q, and 9p, together with overrepresentation (gain) of 3q.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorly differentiated tumors typically shared these aberrations but had other abnormalities, such as evidence of deletion of 4q, 6q, 8p, 11q, 13q, 18q, and 21q and overrepresentation of 1p34-pter, 11q13, 19, and 22q.</p><p/><p>The inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by epigenetic mechanisms has now been reported in HNSCC. Promoter hypermethylation as a mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation has been noted with the <em>DCC</em> gene, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-beta2, P16, and the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (<em>MGMT</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/18,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22</a>].</p><p>These arrays of genomic alterations underscore the complexity of carcinogenic transformation and are consistent with studies in other tumor models, suggesting that many genetic alterations, perhaps involving 10 or more genes, are necessary for fully malignant growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There is great interest in defining the extent to which individual molecular markers dictate prognosis in HNSCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) profiled 279 HNSCC specimens and evaluated the <span class=\"nowrap\">DNA/RNA</span> structural alterations, somatic mutations, genomic alterations by site, stage, human papillomavirus (HPV) status, molecular subtypes, and putative biomarkers. This study is the most recent and comprehensive integrative genomic analysis of HNSCC. With HPV positive tumors, the loss of <em>TRAF3</em>, activating mutations in <em>PIK3CA</em>, and amplification of <em>E2F1</em> were more common. With HPV negative tumors, co-amplification of 11q13 and 11q22, focal deletions in nuclear the set domain <span class=\"nowrap\">gene/tumor</span> suppressor genes, and focal amplifications in receptor tyrosine kinases were more common. The figure highlights the frequency of genetic alterations for HPV positive and HPV negative tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F105412\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105412 \">figure 2</a>). The findings from TCGA provide new insight into HNSCC genomic alterations based on HPV status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DISRUPTION OF MITOGENIC SIGNALING PATHWAYS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitogenic signaling pathways initiated through cell surface receptors are disrupted in most cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Dysregulated factors have included both downstream signaling molecules, such as Ras [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and a number of transmembrane receptors and their ligands. Particular attention has been focused on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a factor in carcinogenesis and as a therapeutic target, as well as the closely related human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 [c-erbB-2]) receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/28-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-35</a>]. Both of these receptors have cytoplasmic domains with tyrosine kinase activity and activate a number of intracellular second messenger pathways.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">EGFR and transforming growth factor-alpha</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both EGFR and its principal ligand, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), are upregulated in HNSCC, constituting an autocrine activation loop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. TGF-alpha overexpression is frequently induced relatively early in carcinogenesis, being elevated in mild dysplasia, with no further increases in advanced dysplasias or carcinoma. In contrast, EGFR expression usually increases progressively with increasing degree of dysplasia and is markedly elevated in many fully transformed HNSCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/28,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32</a>]. EGFR appears to be upregulated to some extent in more than 90 percent of HNSCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. High EGFR levels in HNSCC, as assessed by either protein expression or gene copy number, are associated with shorter overall and progression-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, clinical studies have confirmed the importance of EGFR as a therapeutic target for HNSCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

In HNSCC, these tumors exhibit exclusively <em>HRAS</em> mutation, which is seen in 35 percent of oral cancers in India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In the United States, this is not as common and is seen in only 4 to 5 percent of HNSCC tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. <em>Ras</em> mutations activate the <span class=\"nowrap\">Raf/MEK/ERK</span> pathway and the PI3K pathway, both of which are involved with cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. In HNSCC, overactivation of the PI3K pathway occurs by<em> PI3KCA</em> mutation, which is seen in 6 to 8 percent of cases, or <em>PTEN</em> loss, which is seen in 10 percent of tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

In all of these sites, HER2 overexpression has been identified as a negative prognostic factor. Upregulation of HER2 occurs in approximately 50 percent of all HNSCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In addition to its role in mitogenesis, HER2 signaling is thought to increase metastatic potential through induction of a diverse collection of factors involved in altering cell-cell adhesion and invasiveness. Like EGFR, HER2 expression has been correlated with decreased overall survival in HNSCC in many [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/35,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,42,43</a>], but not all, studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Src kinase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the discovery of EGFR and targeted agents that inhibit the EGFR, research has been focused on mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors.

Activated src phosphorylates the intracellular domain of EGFR and mediates the activation of the STAT3 pathway by EGFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Src kinase is also integral to GRP-induced EGFR activation and downstream signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In one study, targeted inhibition of src family tyrosine kinase activity resulted in decreased GRP-induced EGFR activation and MAPK phosphorylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Constitutive activation of src may mediate resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and resistance might be overcome clinically by combined inhibition of both targets, src and EGFR.

Cyclin D1 pairs with CDK4 and CDK6 to promote cell cycle progression in the G1-S transition, which is critical to commitment to replication and division [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. CCND1 polymorphism, thought to alter cyclin D1 expression, has been associated with HNSCC risk, tumor grade, tumor recurrence, and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Inactivation of the p16/p14 ARF locus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>p16 (<em>CDKN2</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>MTS1</em>)</span> and p14 <em>ARF</em> are overlapping genes in the same locus, encoded by distinct open reading frames and distinct mRNA splice forms.

The gene product p16 is a potent inhibitor of both CDK4 and CDK6. Thus, inactivation of p16, as with overexpression of cyclin D1, increases <span class=\"nowrap\">CDK4/6</span> activity and promotes cell proliferation. On the other hand, re-expression of p16 in HNSCC cells results in significant antitumor effects, both in tissue culture and in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. p14 <em>ARF</em> blocks association of p53 with its inhibitor MDM2.

The regulation of cell cycle by p53 is mediated primarily at the G1-S transition, both through transcriptional induction of cell cycle inhibitors, such as p21, and through transcription-independent mechanisms that are poorly understood.</p><p>The p53 gene is inactivated in at least one-half of HNSCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/58-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-65</a>], although some reports suggest that the mutation rate is higher, approaching 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The timing of p53 inactivation in HNSCC tumorigenesis is controversial, with some reports demonstrating aberrant expression in early dysplasia and the majority suggesting mutation only late in tumor evolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/6,58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,58-60</a>]. The mechanism underlying loss of p53 expression depends on the risk factor for the development of HNSCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinogenesis-molecular-and-genetic-alterations/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. Loss of p53 expression through mutations or loss of heterozygosity is associated with a history of alcohol and tobacco use.
