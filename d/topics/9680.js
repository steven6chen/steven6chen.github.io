People with this problem also feel sick to their stomach and might throw up (nausea). Often, people feel very ill for a few days and then start to feel better. But sometimes, the symptoms last for weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13708978\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes labyrinthitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors are not sure what causes labyrinthitis. The symptoms seem to be caused by swelling or another problem with the nerve inside your brain that controls hearing and balance. In some people, labyrinthitis happens during or after an infection from a virus. But most people with labyrinthitis do not have symptoms of an infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13708995\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of labyrinthitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like you are spinning, swaying, or tilting &ndash; This is a type of dizziness called &quot;vertigo.&quot; You might also feel like the room is moving around you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like you might throw up (nausea)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throwing up (vomiting)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with balancing and walking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss in 1 ear</p><p/><p>If you have all of these symptoms except hearing loss, the condition is called &quot;vestibular neuritis.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13709010\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for labyrinthitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. Your doctor might do tests to make sure you do not have a different problem. These include imaging tests such as an MRI or CT scan. These tests take pictures of your brain and inner ear. They are normal in people with labyrinthitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13709025\"><span class=\"h1\">How is labyrinthitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on your symptoms, how long they have lasted, and what likely caused your labyrinthitis.</p><p>Your doctor might prescribe medicines that can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat infections caused by a virus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce swelling around the nerves inside the brain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat symptoms of vertigo</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p>He or she might also refer to you to a physical therapist (exercise expert) who can teach you special exercises to help with your balance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13709040\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertigo-a-type-of-dizziness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vertigo (a type of dizziness) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dizziness-and-vertigo-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dizziness and vertigo (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
