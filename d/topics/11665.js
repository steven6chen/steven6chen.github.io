It is sometimes classified as a form of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but its pathophysiology and prognosis are different.</p><p>The clinical features, differential diagnosis, diagnosis, etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of NPE are reviewed here. ARDS and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to other causes are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) characteristically presents within minutes to hours of a severe central nervous system insult such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury. However, more rapid onset (immediate) and delayed onset (hours to days) have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Resolution usually occurs within several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Dyspnea is the most common symptom, although mild hemoptysis is present in many patients. The physical examination generally reveals tachypnea, tachycardia, and basilar rales. Chest radiographs typically show a normal size heart with bilateral alveolar opacities, although unilateral opacities have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Hemodynamic measurements are usually normal by the time NPE is diagnosed, including the blood pressure, cardiac output, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.</p><p>There is a broad range of severities of NPE and mild cases may never be detected. While NPE can be fulminant and contribute to death, mortality is more commonly due to the neurologic insult that precipitated the onset of NPE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical findings of neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) may be confused with aspiration pneumonitis. Reliable differentiation between these syndromes is difficult because they are both common in settings of altered consciousness, such as postictal states. NPE tends to develop more rapidly than aspiration pneumonia, while fever and focal opacities, particularly in the lower lung zones, favor aspiration. In addition, NPE tends to resolve more rapidly than lung injury related to aspiration, particularly if aspiration pneumonia develops.</p><p>Other causes of pulmonary edema should also be considered, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or heart failure. The latter can sometimes be seen following severe neurologic injury as a result of neurogenic stunned myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] or, more generally, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, often referred to as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Thus, NPE is a clinical diagnosis based upon the occurrence of pulmonary edema in the appropriate setting and in the absence of a more likely alternative cause. The following criteria for the diagnosis and classification of NPE have been proposed, but have not been widely accepted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral opacities &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</span> </sub>ratio &lt;200</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No evidence of left atrial hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of central nervous system (CNS) injury (severe enough to have caused significantly increased intracranial pressure)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of other common causes of acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; eg, aspiration, massive blood transfusion, sepsis)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary precipitants of neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) are epileptic seizures, traumatic brain injury, and cerebral hemorrhages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57483\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57483 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>]. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Epileptic seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among all patients with epilepsy the occurrence of NPE is rare. However, several case series reported that up to one-third of patients with fatal status epilepticus had clinical evidence of NPE, while an autopsy study found that 87 percent of patients with epilepsy and unexplained sudden death had NPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. It is uncertain whether NPE was the proximate cause of death in these studies, but it is clear that the NPE is more likely with increasing seizure severity. </p><p>NPE due to epileptic seizures generally occurs during the postictal period and it may occur repeatedly in a given individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/3,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,15</a>].

The NPE is usually associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), but raised ICP is not a necessary condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The incidence of NPE in traumatic brain injury has been estimated at 20 percent, and appears to increase with increasing severity of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In a series of 78 cases of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 31 percent had antemortem clinical evidence of NPE and 71 percent had pathological evidence of NPE at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Onset is typically within minutes to hours of the hemorrhage although late onset days after hemorrhage or recurrence after apparent resolution have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. NPE has also been reported during coil embolization of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The most important risk factors for NPE following subarachnoid hemorrhage are the clinical and radiographic severities of the hemorrhages as well as a vertebral artery source of the hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>]. Electrocardiographic abnormalities, heart rate variability, and laboratory abnormalities, including hyperglycemia, acidemia, hyperlactatemia, elevated troponin, and leukocytosis, may also be predictive of the development of NPE following nontraumatic sub-arachnoid hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. NPE can also be seen in up to 35 percent of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, with the primary risk factors in such patients being higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores and increased levels of serum inflammatory markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

It is recognized that a central, transient sympathetic discharge is likely the primary instigator of the resulting pulmonary pathology. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic structures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medulla oblongata is considered the critical anatomic structure involved in the pathogenesis of NPE. The importance of the medulla is supported by the observation that bilateral lesions in the nucleus of the solitary tract, area postrema and lesions in the A1 and A5 neuroadrenergic neurons (all of which are in the medulla) can cause systemic hypertension and NPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>].</p><p>The medulla oblongata probably acts via the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system, as suggested by the following evidence from animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha adrenergic blockade (eg, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prazosin</a>) can prevent the development of NPE</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPE can be prevented by spinal cord transection at or above the C7 level, below which sympathetic fibers leave the lateral part of the cord to form the paraspinal sympathetic trunks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPE can be prevented by denervation by transection of the splanchnic sympathetic fibers to the lungs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPE may be produced by stimulation of the cord at the C7-C8 level, with the cord and sympathetic nerves intact</p><p/><p>In addition to the role of the medulla oblongata, theories regarding the pathogenesis of NPE have centered on the potential contributions of the hypothalamus, elevated intracranial pressure, activation of the sympathoadrenal system, and vagus nerve axonal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/36,37,40-42,44-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37,40-42,44-54</a>]. Among these, the role of the hypothalamus in NPE is most controversial. Experimental models have shown, for example, that inducing hypothalamic lesions precipitates NPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], while a case series of 22 patients with NPE found that half of them had radiographic evidence of hypothalamic injury, a finding associated with worse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, in other animal models, mid-columnar decerebration does not prevent NPE, suggesting that higher CNS centers such as the hypothalamus are not involved in NPE development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of edema formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NPE requires a central nervous system injury or event (eg, seizure) that alters the Starling's forces in a way that increases the movement of fluid from the capillaries to the pulmonary interstitium, increases the permeability of the pulmonary capillaries, or both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66819\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66819 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Capillary hydrostatic pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure is the Starling's force that is most likely to contribute to NPE, since it is unlikely that a CNS injury or event could change capillary or interstitial oncotic pressure rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This is supported by the observation that alveolar fluid has a low fluid to serum protein ratio early during the course of NPE, consistent with hydrostatic pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Experimental studies using animal models and uncontrolled observations in humans suggest several mechanisms by which pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure may increase acutely:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary venoconstriction may occur with intracranial hypertension or sympathetic stimulation. This increases the pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure, producing pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/40,59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,59-62</a>]. Alpha adrenergic antagonists appear to attenuate this effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive systemic venoconstriction may occur leading to a significant increase in venous return to the right heart and pulmonary circulation. Support for this concept comes from animal studies in which prophylactic phlebotomy (15 percent of blood volume) prior to CNS insult prevented development NPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular performance may deteriorate for several reasons: direct myocardial damage or stunning secondary to brain injury, increased afterload due to systemic hypertension, and negative inotropic and chronotropic influences of excessive vagal tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/62,65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,65,66</a>]. This can cause passive elevation of the left atrial and pulmonary capillary pressures, leading to pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/46,47,65,67-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47,65,67-71</a>].</p><p/><p>Despite the evidence that increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure plays a role in NPE, there are likely additional contributors. This notion is based upon reports of NPE occurring with little or no elevation in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and in the absence of left atrial or systemic hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary capillary permeability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased pulmonary capillary permeability may contribute to NPE. This idea is supported by the finding of protein-rich edema fluid in animal models and some patients with NPE, as well as the observation that NPE can occur in the absence of the hemodynamic alterations associated with pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/4,58,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,58,72,73</a>].</p><p>As an example, a study used thermal green dye techniques to measure extravascular lung water in 18 patients with either head trauma or subarachnoid hemorrhage and 13 control patients (trauma patients without head injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Nine of the 18 patients with brain injuries had pulmonary edema, defined as extravascular lung water values greater than two standard deviations above the control group mean. The pulmonary edema was independent of intracranial or pulmonary vascular pressure, suggesting increased vascular permeability.</p><p>The mechanism by which neural influences produce changes in pulmonary vascular permeability have not been elucidated well. However, several hypotheses exist:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropeptide Y, which is released by sympathetic nerves along with norepinephrine, increases pulmonary vascular permeability by acting directly on endothelial cells and has been found in alveolar macrophages and edema fluid in rats with NPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha adrenergic agonists released in response to brain injury may cause the release of a second mediator, which increases vascular permeability (eg, endorphins, histamine, bradykinin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An initial rapid increase in pulmonary vascular pressure (eg, due to pulmonary vasospasm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased systemic venous return) may cause pulmonary microvascular injury with a subsequent increase in permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. This theory, sometimes called the &quot;blast theory&quot; is supported by studies in rabbits showing that pulmonary capillaries are damaged when pressures exceed 40 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. It is also supported by the observation that patients with NPE frequently have mild hemoptysis or pulmonary hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The hypothesis is imperfect because the rapid development of acute pulmonary hypertension is not a necessary condition for NPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>] and in animal models elevated pulmonary vascular pressures do not invariably lead to NPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p/><p>Inflammatory mechanisms may also contribute to increased capillary permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

In one study, an experimental animal model of epilepsy-induced NPE, suggested cell apoptosis contributes to the development of NPE by increasing Bax, decreasing Bcl-2, and activating caspase 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. In an autopsy series of pediatric patients with NPE in the setting of enterovirus 71 infection down-regulation of alveolar fluid clearance proteins, including aquaporin 4, was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcome of patients with neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is usually determined by the course of the neurologic insult and not the NPE.

As an example, a recent observational study of 108 patients with non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, found that compared to those without NPE, those who developed NPE had a higher one-year mortality of (37 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurogenic-pulmonary-edema/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is an increase in pulmonary interstitial and alveolar fluid that is due to an acute central nervous system (CNS) injury. It usually develops rapidly following the injury. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPE characteristically presents within minutes to hours of a severe CNS insult. Dyspnea is the most common symptom, although mild hemoptysis is present in many patients. The physical examination generally reveals tachypnea, tachycardia, and basilar rales. Chest radiographs typically show a normal size heart with bilateral alveolar filling, while hemodynamic measurements are usually normal. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPE is a clinical diagnosis based upon the occurrence of pulmonary edema in the appropriate setting and in the absence of a more likely alternative cause. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary precipitants of NPE are epileptic seizures, traumatic brain injury, and cerebral hemorrhages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57483\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57483 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPE is thought to occur when a neurologic insult affects the medulla oblongata, leading to a massive sympathetic discharge. This sympathetic discharge causes abrupt alterations in cardio-pulmonary hemodynamics and subsequent increased capillary hydrostatic pressure and pulmonary vascular permeability. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of NPE should focus on treating the neurological disorder while NPE is managed in a supportive fashion. Many episodes of NPE are well tolerated and most resolve within 48 to 72 hours. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with NPE are hypoxemic and require supplemental oxygen. Some patients may require mechanical ventilation, which differs from that for other causes of respiratory failure in two ways: permissive hypercapnia and high levels of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be used cautiously. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of medications have been used to treat patients with NPE, but their efficacy in this setting has not been established.
