In HF, neurohumoral adaptations have beneficial as well as maladaptive effects.</p><p>The major neurohumoral adaptations that occur in HF, including activation of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems; increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone, natriuretic peptides, and endothelin; and alterations in nitric oxide, will be reviewed here. Hemodynamic alterations in HF are discussed separately.

However, the slowing of disease progression and improvement in survival observed with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and beta blockers in patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction suggest that there is, over time, a <strong>net negative</strong> effect of the neurohumoral adaptations on ventricular function. These clinical benefits occur even in patients with mild or absent symptoms who may have only modest activation of these systems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF NEUROHUMORAL ADAPTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal neurohumoral systems involved in the response to HF are the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and antidiuretic hormone&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58128\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58128 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. Other vasoactive substances are also affected, including the vasoconstrictor endothelin and the vasodilators atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and nitric oxide. These hormonal changes are seen with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sympathetic nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the first responses to a decrease in cardiac output (sensed as a fall in blood pressure) is activation of the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in both increased release and decreased uptake of norepinephrine (NE) at adrenergic nerve endings. Downregulation or genetic loss-of-function variants of peripheral alpha-2 receptors, which normally inhibit NE release, may contribute to sympathetic activation in HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Early in HF, catecholamine-induced augmentation of ventricular contractility and heart rate help maintain cardiac output, particularly during exercise. However, with progressive worsening of ventricular function, these mechanisms are no longer sufficient. In addition, intrinsic mechanisms that enhance ventricular contractility due to the normal force-frequency relationship are blunted in HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Increased sympathetic activity also leads to systemic and pulmonary vasoconstriction and enhanced venous tone, both of which initially contribute to the maintenance of blood pressure by increasing ventricular preload. Renal vasoconstriction (mediated by both NE and angiotensin II) occurs primarily at the efferent arteriole, producing an increase in filtration fraction that allows glomerular filtration to be relatively well maintained despite a fall in renal blood flow. Both NE and angiotensin II also stimulate proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, which contributes to the sodium retention characteristic of HF.</p><p>Sympathetic activation results in an increase in the plasma NE concentration, which correlates directly with the severity of the cardiac dysfunction and inversely with survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62001\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62001 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An analysis of more than 4000 patients from the Val-HeFT trial found that those with an initial plasma NE concentration in the highest quartile (&ge;572 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [3.38 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> had a significantly higher mortality rate at two years than those with an initial plasma NE concentration in the lowest quartile (&lt;274 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [1.62 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> (24.2 versus 13.8 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59265 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The degree of sympathetic activation can be reduced by effective treatment of HF, as with administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. In a study of 223 patients with mild or moderate HF, for example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramipril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramipril</a> therapy for 12 weeks significantly lowered the plasma NE concentration (compared with placebo) in patients with the most pronounced degree of neurohumoral activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the SOLVD trial, patients who had more marked neurohumoral activation, as reflected by plasma NE or angiotensin II, had a larger survival benefit with ACE inhibition than patients with less activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>These observations suggested that other methods of inhibiting sympathetic outflow might be of value in patients with HF, and led to the use of moxonidine, a drug that acts centrally to decrease sympathetic outflow. However, in the MOXCON trial, titration to a moxonidine target dose of 1.5 mg BID, which is associated with a decrease in plasma NE on the order of 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], was associated with an increase in deaths and adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This experience showed that the role of sympathetic tone in HF is complex, exerting both adverse and beneficial effects, and that over-suppression of sympathetic tone, at least when generalized, can be harmful.</p><p>In addition to systemic sympathetic activation, there is an increase in cardiac efferent sympathetic activity in patients with HF. This effect has been demonstrated by increased cardiac NE spillover (ie, elevated NE levels in cardiac veins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. A reduction in ventricular filling pressures reduces cardiac NE spillover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A similar effect is seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> and may contribute to its clinical effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular arrhythmias in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The chronic increase in sympathetic activity also leads to downregulation and reduction in density of the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors and desensitization of the signaling cascade through which the receptors couple to physiologic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]; this results in impaired inotropic and chronotropic responses. In addition, chronically increased stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors may cause molecular and cellular abnormalities that contribute to the progression of myocardial dysfunction by the re-expression of fetal protein isoforms and the loss of cardiomyocytes due to apoptosis or necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of myocardial adrenergic receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the myocardium are mediated by both beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptors in the myocardium. Stimulation of beta-1, and to a lesser extent, beta-2 adrenergic receptors on the cardiac myocyte increases contractility of the heart. These same receptors also mediate the adverse effects of pathologically increased catecholamines on myocyte viability. Myocyte apoptosis in HF has been attributed primarily to beta-1 adrenergic receptors that couple to stimulatory G protein (Gs)-dependent cAMP-mediated signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Excessive stimulation of beta-1 receptors may also lead to myocyte necrosis that is modulated by calcium overload and mitochondria permeability transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In HF, there is a selective reduction in the density of beta-1 but not beta-2 receptors on the cardiac myocyte [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. As a result, the failing heart may be more dependent upon beta-2 adrenergic receptors for inotropic support. In addition, a polymorphism of the beta-2 receptor has been found in which a threonine (Thr) is replaced by isoleucine (Ile) at amino acid 164 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], resulting in a substantial decrease in the activity of the receptor. Transgenic mice expressing the Ile164 switch display depressed resting and agonist-stimulated contractile function compared with mice with the Thr164 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one series in humans, there was no difference in the frequency of these receptor genotypes in 259 patients with HF compared with 212 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, patients with the Ile164 receptor had a reduced one-year survival (42 versus 76 percent for those with the Thr164 receptor) and a relative risk of death or cardiac transplantation of 4.8 (p&lt;0.001). A possible mechanism is blunted cardiac beta-2 receptor responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition to helping to support the myocardial contractile response to sympathetic stimulation, beta-2 adrenergic receptors located on the cardiac myocyte exert an anti-apoptotic effect that opposes the pro-apoptotic action of beta-1 receptor stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, stimulation of pre-synaptic beta-2 receptors in the myocardium may mediate adverse effects. In contrast to presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which inhibit sympathetic NE release, presynaptic beta-2 adrenergic receptors stimulate NE release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Possibly related to this action, beta-2 receptor stimulation appears to increase the propensity for ventricular fibrillation. As an example, one study of animals with experimentally induced HF found that an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> infusion activated beta-2 receptors to a greater extent and resulted in a greater intracellular influx of calcium during ischemia compared with non-HF rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These actions were prevented by selective blockade of the beta-2 receptor, but not by blockade of the beta-1 receptor, and beta-2 receptor blockade prevented ischemia mediated ventricular fibrillation. Beta-blockers may act in part by reducing beta-2 receptor-mediated NE release in the heart, an effect that appears to be greater with nonselective versus selective beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Renin-angiotensin system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the factors that stimulate renal renin release is activated in HF: decreased stretch of the glomerular afferent arteriole, reduced delivery of chloride to the macula densa, and increased beta-1 adrenergic activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65116 \">figure 5</a>). Typically, plasma renin levels are elevated in patients with recent onset or very symptomatic HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58128\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58128 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/1,6,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,31</a>].</p><p>In addition, angiotensin II can be synthesized locally at a variety of tissue sites including the heart, kidney, blood vessels, adrenal gland, and brain. For this reason, measurement of the plasma renin activity or angiotensin II concentration may underestimate tissue angiotensin II activity. As an example, the plasma renin activity is often normal in patients with stable, chronic HF, despite persistence of the low output state and renal sodium retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Studies in experimental models of HF suggest that there may be increased activity of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Likewise, local cardiac angiotensin II and angiotensin converting enzyme production is increased in proportion to the severity of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Actions of angiotensin II on the heart&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in heart failure: Mechanisms of action&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Angiotensin II has many similar actions to NE in HF, increasing sodium reabsorption (an effect mediated in part by enhanced release of aldosterone) and inducing systemic and renal vasoconstriction. Similar to NE, angiotensin II can act directly on myocytes and other cell types in the myocardium to promote pathologic remodeling via myocyte hypertrophy, re-expression of fetal protein isoforms, myocyte apoptosis, and alterations in the interstitial matrix. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac remodeling: Basic aspects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Aldosterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary hyperaldosteronism in HF has been thought to reflect angiotensin II-mediated stimulation of the adrenal glands. However, there is also local production of aldosterone in the failing heart in proportion to the severity of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], an effect that is mediated by the induction of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) by angiotensin II in the failing ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Blockade of the adverse effects of aldosterone-induced stimulation of cardiac mineralocorticoid receptors is thought to contribute to the survival benefit associated with the administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in selected patients with HF.

This gene may manifest insertion (I) or deletion (D) polymorphism and three genotypes (DD, ID, and II). Plasma and cardiac levels of ACE are 1.5- to 3-fold higher in patients with the DD compared with the II genotype; the values are intermediate in patients with ID genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The DD genotype of the ACE gene has been associated with a number of adverse cardiovascular events.

This difference may be abolished with beta blocker therapy as, in one study, transplant-free survival was equivalent in patients with the DD, ID, and II genotypes who were treated with a beta blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The adverse effect of the DD genotype on survival in patients with HF may be related to progression of HF rather than to arrhythmic sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antidiuretic hormone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activation of the carotid sinus and aortic arch baroreceptors by the low cardiac output in HF leads to enhanced release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and stimulation of thirst (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema#H165025668\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;, section on 'Role of ADH in volume regulation'</a>). Elevated levels of ADH may contribute to the increase in systemic vascular resistance in HF via stimulation of the V1A receptor, which is found on vascular smooth muscle cells, and also promote water retention via the V2 receptor by enhancing water reabsorption in the collecting tubules. The combination of decreased water excretion and increased water intake via thirst often leads to a fall in the plasma sodium concentration. The severity of these defects tends to parallel the severity of the HF. As a result, the degree of hyponatremia is an important predictor of survival in these patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55554\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55554 \">figure 6</a>).

Plasma endothelin concentrations are increased in patients with HF; experimental studies suggest that endothelin is released in part from cardiac myocytes and coronary vascular endothelium, and that angiotensin II may contribute to the high circulating levels in HF. Over the long term, high levels of endothelin (as with angiotensin II) may be deleterious to the heart due, for example, to pathologic remodeling. This has led to the evaluation of endothelin inhibition as a therapy for HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-endothelin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of endothelin in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial and brain natriuretic peptides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is primarily released from the atria in response to volume expansion, which is sensed as an increase in atrial stretch. ANP release is increased in HF. Plasma ANP levels rise early in the course of the disease and have been used as a marker for the diagnosis of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. With chronic and more advanced HF, ventricular cells can also be recruited to secrete both ANP and BNP, an analogous peptide, in response to the high ventricular filling pressures. These relationships have allowed the plasma concentration of these peptides, particularly BNP, to be used to detect HF and to predict the outcome and perhaps guide therapy in patients with established disease. These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While plasma natriuretic peptide levels are useful biomarkers of disease severity, there is also evidence that natriuretic peptides, and in particular BNP, play an important beneficial role in the pathophysiology of HF. The natriuretic peptides exert a wide array of cellular and systemic effects which, by and large, oppose those of the adverse effects of the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. For example, they oppose vasoconstriction, promote salt and water excretion, and protect target organs from the adverse effects of NE and angiotensin. The combination drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sacubitril-and-valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sacubitril-valsartan</a> exerts outcome effects superior to ACE inhibition. Since a major action of sacubitril is inhibition of the degradation of natriuretic peptides, the clinical benefits of this drug has led to the thesis that the incremental benefit is due to elevation of natriuretic peptide levels beyond those already present in HF.
