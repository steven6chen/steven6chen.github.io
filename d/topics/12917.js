These syndromes may affect any part of the nervous system from cerebral cortex to neuromuscular junction and muscle, either damaging one area or multiple areas.</p><p>Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting the spinal cord will be reviewed here. An overview of paraneoplastic syndromes and other paraneoplastic disorders are discussed separately.

Back <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radicular pain are infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Symptoms progress over days or weeks and often terminate in respiratory failure and death. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination reveals an elevated protein concentration, usually without pleocytosis. There are no biologic markers or antibodies associated with this disorder; as a result, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made premortem. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show contrast enhancement within the spinal cord. </p><p>In one report of a patient with paraneoplastic necrotizing myelopathy who responded to treatment with corticosteroids but eventually died of complications of metastatic esophageal cancer, the autopsy confirmed the presence of necrosis of the spinal cord and mild inflammatory infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of paraneoplastic necrotizing myelopathy includes leptomeningeal, epidural, and intramedullary metastasis. In addition, necrotizing myelopathy can also result from viral infections (particularly of the herpes group), septic infarcts, and toxic effects of intrathecal chemotherapy and radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It has also been suggested that some cases of necrotizing myelopathy are secondary to the neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum of disorders that occur in association with antibodies to aquaporin 4 (NMO antibodies).

One patient has been described with breast cancer and a motor neuron syndrome who had antibodies directed against axonal initial elements and nodes of Ranvier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Subacute motor neuronopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subacute motor neuronopathy was initially reported in patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. The disorder is characterized by subacute, progressive, painless, and often asymmetric lower motor neuron weakness. Although some patients have sensory symptoms, the neurologic examination reveals few or no objective sensory deficits. Pathologic findings include severe neuronal degeneration of the anterior horn cells, with variable inflammatory infiltrates, and demyelination with mild axonal loss of the posterior columns of the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The decreasing frequency of this syndrome over time suggests that the etiology could be a viral infection that was missed in the original descriptions. Alternatively, the disorder could be due to other causes that are currently prevented with the management of patients with lymphoma.</p><p>The course of the neurologic disorder is usually independent of the course of the lymphoma, although spontaneous neurologic improvement has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other less well-defined motor neuron syndromes may be paraneoplastic in nature. In a prospective study in which all patients with motor neuron disease had a bone marrow biopsy, there was a higher-than-expected incidence of lymphoma (2 of 31 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As a result of this study, some authors suggest a routine bone marrow examination in patients with a motor neuron syndrome and atypical features such as an M-protein by immunofixation electrophoresis, or clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of a possible lymphoproliferative disease (eg, lymphadenopathy, abnormal chest radiograph, unexplained elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or anemia).</p><p>It has also been suggested that women who have an upper motor neuron syndrome resembling primary lateral sclerosis should undergo mammography to rule out a breast carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">STIFF-PERSON SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stiff-person syndrome (formerly called stiff-man syndrome) is an uncommon disorder characterized by progressive muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasm involving the axial muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The muscle spasms are triggered by different stimuli and may lead to limb deformities and fracture. Electrophysiologic studies show continuous discharges of motor unit potentials, which improve during sleep or general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stiff-person-syndrome#H3136054728\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stiff-person syndrome&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome usually occurs in patients with breast cancer and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. Some of these patients also develop a paraneoplastic encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The serum of patients with paraneoplastic stiff-person syndrome often contains antibodies against a protein called amphiphysin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/15,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,19</a>]. By contrast, patients with stiff-person syndrome who do not have cancer (but who usually develop diabetes and other symptoms of endocrinopathy) have antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Both GAD65 and amphiphysin are cytoplasmic proteins that are not exposed on the cell surface; it has been suggested that amphiphysin may be transiently exposed during the process of synaptic vesicle uptake and thereby accessed by circulating antibodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stiff-person-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stiff-person syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Antibodies to the alpha 1 subunit of the glycine receptor (GlyR) with or without concurrent GAD autoimmunity have been reported in some patients with stiff-person syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; most of these patients do not have cancer. GlyR antibodies are more characteristic of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), a disorder in which patients develop symptoms similar to stiff-person syndrome along with brainstem dysfunction, seizures, or encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Most patients with GlyR antibodies do not have cancer; however, in a study of 52 patients with PERM and GlyR antibodies, 5 patients had a previous history of neoplasms and 4 had tumors identified during the study of PERM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stiff-person-syndrome#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stiff-person syndrome&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Response to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment consists of control of the tumor and the administration of benzodiazepines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>. In those who do not respond, glucocorticoids, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), or other immunosuppressive agents can be tried.

Associated antibodies most frequently detected are anti-Hu, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-CRMP5/CV2,</span> and, less frequently, antiamphiphysin antibodies. The usual culprit is small cell lung cancer (SCLC).</p><p>In one retrospective series, 15 patients were described with either neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or recurrent longitudinal myelitis in association with antibodies that target the astrocytic water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) who also had or soon developed cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Given that AQP4 is expressed by many different types of cancers, the association between cancer and NMO spectrum of symptoms could be coincidental. However, two patients with cancer in this series had AQP4 autoantibodies without myelitis, suggesting the possibility that autoimmunity against AQP4 could represent a tumor-induced autoimmunity or a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromyelitis-optica-spectrum-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One case series described 31 patients with an isolated progressive paraneoplastic myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The most common coexisting cancers were lung and breast; kidney cancer, thyroid cancer, gynecologic cancers, and melanomas were also present in a few patients. Antibodies to amphiphysin and CRMP5 were the most commonly identified paraneoplastic biomarkers, observed in eight and nine patients, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities, identified in 20 patients, included signal abnormality that extended over more than three vertebral segments and was often associated with contrast enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis often showed elevated protein levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pleocytosis. Most patients did not improve, even after oncologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunosuppressive therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBACUTE SENSORY NEURONOPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sensory deficits of paraneoplastic subacute sensory neuronopathy typically begin with loss of vibratory sensation and joint position sense following by impairment in pain and temperature sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. By the time the patient is first examined, there is usually moderate to severe involvement of all sensory modalities. These sensory deficits frequently lead to prominent ataxia, which is exacerbated by eye closure and associated with pseudoathetoid movements of the fingers and extremities.</p><p>Patients frequently complain of the sensation of &quot;pins and needles&quot; or &quot;electric shocks.&quot; The symptoms may initially affect one extremity but, in a few weeks or months, they usually progress to involve other extremities, the face, the abdomen, or the trunk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In a subset of patients, hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain remain the prominent symptoms, and sensory ataxia is mild or even absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>These symptoms typically predate the discovery of a tumor. The association with pain may erroneously lead to the diagnosis of radiculopathy or polyneuropathy. In one case control study, clinical features that distinguished this syndrome from a sensory neuropathy included limb ataxia, asymmetric distribution, and sensory loss other than in the legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Other neurologic findings may include sensorineural hearing loss, diminished taste sensation, and symmetric or asymmetric reduction or loss of deep tendon reflexes. Among patients with subacute sensory neuronopathy who have anti-Hu antibodies and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), many progress to paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Neurophysiologic studies show a variety of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced or absent sensory potentials with normal or borderline motor nerve conduction velocities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of denervation are usually seen in patients with myelitis and lower motor neuron dysfunction.</p><p/><p>Abnormal motor conduction velocity with axonal and demyelinating features may occur, complicating the differential diagnosis between peripheral nerve and dorsal root ganglia involvement. Neurophysiologic features that can help distinguish sensory neuronopathy from peripheral nerve disorder include at least one absent or three low (&lt;30 percent of normal) sensory action potentials in the arms with fewer than two abnormal motor nerve conduction studies in the legs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be normal but often shows moderate pleocytosis, increased proteins, intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin G (IgG), and oligoclonal bands.</p><p>Histologic examination reveals a mononuclear cell infiltrate in the dorsal root ganglia that is probably immune mediated, neuronal degeneration, and proliferation of the satellite cells (Nageotte nodules) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65517\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65517 \">picture 1</a>). There is also a variable involvement of the dorsal and ventral nerve roots, and secondary demyelination of the spinal cord dorsal columns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Sural nerve biopsy shows a reduction in myelinated fiber density with depletion of large fibers most prominent in those with more severe sensory ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Approximately 80 percent of patients with subacute sensory neuronopathy have SCLC, usually in association with anti-Hu antibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111054 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Some have anti-CV2 antibodies, directed against antigens present on peripheral nerves, often in conjunction with anti-Hu antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. If both antibodies are present, a mixed axonal and demyelinating sensory motor neuropathy may be superimposed on subacute sensory neuronopathy.</p><p>Other tumors associated with subacute sensory neuronopathy include breast, prostate, or colon cancers; lymphoma; or uterine sarcoma. Thus, tumor screening with computed tomography (CT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) should be considered in patients with suspected paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis also includes toxic side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>, and vinca alkaloids). Cisplatin neuropathy and paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy can usually be distinguished by the fact that cisplatin produces a large fiber neuropathy affecting position and vibration sense almost exclusively and sparing pin and temperature sense, whereas the paraneoplastic disorder affects all sensory modalities. Sensory neuronopathy can also be seen in association with autoimmune disorders (eg, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, celiac disease, autoimmune hepatitis) and infections (eg, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, varicella zoster) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].
