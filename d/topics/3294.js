The identification of these risk factors provides an opportunity to minimize the incidence of bladder cancer through smoking cessation programs and decreasing exposure to workplace carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Other potentially useful approaches include increasing cruciferous vegetable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and fluid intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], decreasing dietary fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and losing weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Any of these factors must be placed in the context of possible predisposing genetic factors, which are poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Chemoprevention is the use of systemic agents to prevent or reverse these changes. Primary chemoprevention seeks to block the formation of de novo bladder cancers in healthy individuals, while secondary chemoprevention focuses on avoiding formation of additional tumors in patients who have already been treated for bladder cancer. Although chemoprevention is not routinely recommended in either primary or secondary settings, it is an area of active clinical investigation.</p><p>The chemoprevention of bladder cancer with systemic agents is reviewed here, with the focus primarily on agents for which epidemiologic or clinical trial data are available. The use of intravesical agents to prevent the recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premalignant and malignant changes occur in the urothelium of urinary tract that are chronically exposed to environmental carcinogens in a process referred to as field cancerization. Within this exposed field, chemical carcinogens damage DNA in the urothelial cell epithelium, allowing cancer to develop from multiple clones. These carcinogens are excreted in the urine and stored temporarily in the bladder, where they have an extended opportunity to interact with the urothelium. The gradual accumulation of chromosomal damage in the urothelial cells eventually results in phenotypic expression and transformation into overt neoplasm.</p><p>These carcinogens form highly reactive electrophilic species that bind nucleic acid and induce structural mutations within bladder epithelial cells. The observed changes (which may vary in different cells) include allelic deletions, loss of heterozygosity, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, or activation of proto-oncogenes. The molecular mechanisms and pathways associated with the development of bladder cancer are discussed elsewhere.

In addition, increased urine output (attained by increased fluid intake) works to flush carcinogens out of the bladder, thereby minimizing exposure time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TARGET POPULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective bladder cancer chemoprevention is facilitated by the elucidation of appropriate target populations.</p><p>The identification of risk factors for bladder cancer identifies populations for whom primary chemoprevention could be of potential utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) irreversibly inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme that is required for polyamine synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>DFMO was evaluated as a secondary chemopreventive agent in a randomized trial in which 454 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent Ta or T1, grade 1 to 2 bladder cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with DFMO or placebo for one year following resection of their bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. At a median follow-up of 42 months, DFMO did not decrease the incidence of tumor recurrence (46 versus 43 percent with placebo), nor were any benefits observed in terms of the number of patients with progression to carcinoma in situ or grade 3 disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclooxygenases catalyze the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. The effects of prostaglandin synthesis may include increased angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptosis, and decreased immune surveillance, all of which may contribute to carcinogenesis. Although preclinical data suggest a possible benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], no clinical trial to date has demonstrated a benefit for secondary chemoprevention.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Celecoxib</a>, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, was evaluated as a secondary chemopreventive agent in a phase IIB clinical trial in which 146 patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who achieved an initial complete response to induction BCG followed by three weeks of maintenance BCG were randomized to celecoxib 200 mg daily or placebo. In this setting, no benefit in time to recurrence or recurrence rate was demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Although there was hope that the lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects would indicate a superior therapeutic index in favor of using the selective COX-2 inhibitors, they have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk in some trials. Despite this, there was no increased risk demonstrated in this trial, and celecoxib remains available in some areas of the world.</p><p>This study was followed by a phase III clinical trial in London in which 475 patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer who achieved complete response to resection and induction BCG were randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> at a higher dose (400 mg daily or 200 mg twice daily),or placebo. This trial completed accrual in 2011, and the three-year recurrence rate results are expected soon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemoprevention-of-urothelial-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Overall, it seems unlikely that selective COX-2 inhibitors will find widespread use in cancer prevention for an otherwise healthy population.
