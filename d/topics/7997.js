There are different types of headache. The 2 most common types are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tension headaches</strong> &ndash; Tension headaches cause pressure or tightness on both sides of the head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Migraine headaches</strong> &ndash; Migraine headaches often start off mild and then get worse. They often affect just 1 side of the head. They can cause nausea or vomiting, or make you sensitive to light and sound.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471877307\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to feel better when I have a headache?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some people feel better if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take non-prescription pain medicines (but check with your doctor first if you have a health condition or already take prescription medicines)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lie down in a cool, dark, quiet room (this works best for migraine headaches)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2172598246\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your headache comes on suddenly, quickly becomes severe, or could be described as &quot;the worst headache of your life&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever or stiff neck with your headache</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You also have a seizure, personality changes or confusion, or you pass out</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your headache began right after you exercised or had a minor injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have new headaches, especially if you are pregnant or older than 40</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have weakness, numbness, or trouble seeing (migraine headaches can sometimes cause these symptoms, but you should be seen right away the first time these symptoms happen)</p><p/><p>You should also see a doctor or nurse if you get headaches often or if your headaches are severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471877314\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to keep from getting headaches?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some people find that their headaches are triggered by certain foods or things they do. To keep from getting headaches in the future, you can keep a &quot;headache calendar.&quot; In the calendar, write down every time you have a headache and what you ate and did before it started. That way you can find out if there is anything you should avoid eating or doing. You can also write down what medicine you took for the headache and whether or not it helped.</p><p>Some common headache triggers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skipping meals or eating too little</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having too little or too much caffeine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeping too much or too little</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain drinks or foods, such as red wine, aged cheese, and hot dogs</p><p/><p>If your headaches are frequent, severe, or long-lasting, your doctor can suggest ways to try to prevent them. For example, it might help to learn relaxation techniques and ways to manage stress. In some cases, medicines can also help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471877328\"><span class=\"h1\">How is headache treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are lots of medicines that can ease the pain of headaches. You can try taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). There are prescription medicines that can help, too. The right medicine for you will depend on what type of headaches you get, how often you get them, and how bad they are.</p><p>If you get headaches often, work with your doctor to find a treatment that helps. Do not try to manage frequent headaches on your own with non-prescription pain medicines. Taking non-prescription pain medicines too often can actually cause more headaches later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471877342\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Migraine headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Migraine headaches in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Migraine headaches in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-causes-and-diagnosis-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache causes and diagnosis in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
