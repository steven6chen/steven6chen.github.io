Infections that you can catch during sex are called &quot;sexually transmitted infections.&quot; It is also possible for a pregnant woman to give syphilis to her baby.</p><p>Syphilis has different stages. Each stage causes a different set of symptoms. The stages (in the order they happen) are called:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary syphilis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary syphilis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latent syphilis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tertiary syphilis</p><p/><p>In some cases, the infection moves to the brain. This is called &quot;neurosyphilis.&quot; It can happen in any of the stages of syphilis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13957737\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of primary syphilis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary syphilis is the first stage of infection. Symptoms start 2 to 3 weeks after the person becomes infected. At that time, the person usually gets a raised red bump on the spot where the infection first entered the body. This bump is usually painless. Eventually it turns into a small sore (or ulcer) with a raised edge.</p><p>The sores caused by syphilis usually form on the penis or around the vagina or anus. But they can also form in places that are hard to see, such as the back of the throat or inside the vagina or rectum.</p><p>Sores caused by primary syphilis usually heal on their own within a few weeks. Since they don't hurt, many people don't get treatment for them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13957752\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of secondary syphilis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary syphilis is the second stage of infection. It starts weeks or a few months after primary syphilis and happens in about 25 percent of people who don't get treatment for their primary syphilis.</p><p>Symptoms of secondary syphilis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A widespread rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large, raised, gray or white patches on warm, moist areas of the body (such as the mouth and genitals)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat, muscle aches, and other flu-like symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpit, and groin area (lymph nodes are bean-shaped organs scattered throughout the body that store infection-fighting cells)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13957767\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of latent syphilis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Latent syphilis actually causes no symptoms. People who have this form can have the infection for years without knowing it. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13957782\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of late stage syphilis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late stage syphilis (also called tertiary syphilis) can cause serious damage to the heart, skin, brain, and other organs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342264857\"><span class=\"h1\">What is neurosyphilis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurosyphilis is the term for a syphilis infection that has moved into the brain, the spinal cord, or the tissues that surround both. Neurosyphilis can happen during any of the stages of syphilis. Symptoms of it include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision loss or trouble seeing clearly</p><p/><p>If the doctor suspects you have neurosyphilis, you might need a test called a &quot;lumbar puncture,&quot; sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap.&quot; For this test, the doctor takes a small sample of fluid from the space around the spinal cord. Then the fluid is tested for the bacteria that cause syphilis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13957797\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for syphilis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor can order blood tests to find out if you have syphilis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13957812\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you should see a doctor or nurse if you have any of the symptoms listed above. You should also see a doctor or nurse if any of your sexual partners have been diagnosed with syphilis. Even if you have no symptoms, you could be infected. If you are infected, there are treatments to cure syphilis.</p><p>If you see a doctor or nurse to be checked for syphilis, he or she might want to test you for other sexually transmitted infections, too. That's because people who get one type of sexually transmitted infection are often at risk for other types.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13957827\"><span class=\"h1\">How is syphilis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Syphilis is usually treated with an antibiotic called penicillin. The amount of time a person must take penicillin depends on what stage of infection they are in. People who are allergic to penicillin need to take a different antibiotic.</p><p>After finishing treatment, most people need follow-up testing to make sure they are cured. Some people need to get multiple blood tests over a few years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13957842\"><span class=\"h1\">Can syphilis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting syphilis by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a latex condom every time you have sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding sex when you or your partner has any symptoms that could be caused by an infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having sex</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13957857\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Screening for sexually transmitted infections (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anogenital-warts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anogenital warts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Genital herpes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-after-rape-or-sexual-assault-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Care after rape or sexual assault (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-hiv-after-unprotected-sex-or-needle-sharing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preventing HIV after unprotected sex or needle-sharing (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-warts-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Genital warts in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Genital herpes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pubic-lice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pubic lice (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adult-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adult women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barrier-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Barrier methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-after-sexual-assault-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Care after sexual assault (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
