These procedures include transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), transurethral resection of bladder tumors, hysteroscopic transcervical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (eg, resection of submucosal leiomyomas), percutaneous removal of kidney stones, and some other percutaneous and minimally invasive procedures.</p><p>The electrosurgery devices that have traditionally been used during these procedures have a monopolar design and cannot be used with electrolyte-containing irrigation fluids (eg, isotonic saline or lactated Ringer's). Several different nonconductive (ie, non-electrolyte) solutions have been employed. The use of these non-electrolyte solutions has been associated with a number of complications including hyponatremia, a variable degree of hypoosmolality, and certain solution-specific problems described below.</p><p>Bipolar electrosurgery devices and various laser and microwave systems have been introduced, and these devices are compatible with electrolyte-containing irrigation and distension solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Use of isotonic saline or Ringer's lactate solution will not generate hyponatremia. However, absorption of a large volume of saline solution will expand the extracellular fluid volume and may generate volume overload, pulmonary edema, and hypertension.</p><p>Hyponatremia following use of nonconductive (ie, non-electrolyte) irrigation solutions for transurethral resection of the prostate or bladder or for hysteroscopy will be reviewed here.

The severity of hyponatremia is directly related to the volume of irrigation fluid that is retained. Patients with a decrease in serum sodium of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or more are likely to develop neurologic symptoms. The volume of irrigant fluid absorption required to develop this degree of hyponatremia is smaller in women than in men (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Volume and rate of fluid absorption'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of neurologic symptoms'</a> below).</p><p>Based upon data from large multicenter series, hyponatremia severe enough to produce confusion and nausea and vomiting (each of which can also be due to other factors) occurs in approximately 2 percent of men undergoing TUR of the prostate (this is often called the &quot;post-TURP syndrome&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>], while fluid overload <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyponatremia occurs in 0.06 to 0.2 percent of women undergoing hysteroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Hyponatremia also occurs after percutaneous nephrolithotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major risk factor for hyponatremia following transurethral resection, hysteroscopy, or other percutaneous procedures is the volume of irrigant absorbed. Absorption of 1000 mL of glycine irrigation fluid in women undergoing hysteroscopy is associated with a reduction in serum sodium of approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74942\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74942 \">figure 1</a>), while 3000 mL reduces the serum sodium by approximately 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>Men undergoing TUR of the prostate show smaller reductions of 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> after absorbing 1000 mL and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> after absorbing 3000 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. These gender differences are probably due mostly to higher lean body weight and total body water in men. Thus, men must absorb more fluid than women to produce the same dilutional reduction in serum sodium (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Halt procedure at absorption thresholds'</a> below).</p><p>Procedural risk factors for excess fluid absorption and hyponatremia during endoscopic procedures include the type of procedure (operative versus diagnostic), introduction of fluid at high pressure, visceral perforation, prolonged operative time, and type of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Operative procedures are associated with a higher risk of excess fluid absorption than diagnostic procedures. When tissue is resected, veins may be severed (eg, large prostatic veins) or uterine venous sinuses may be exposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. Irrigation fluid can then be directly and rapidly absorbed into the vascular system. In hysteroscopy, for example, the risk of excess fluid absorption is particularly high during resection of fibroids. The risk is much lower with diagnostic procedures since monopolar electrosurgery is not performed and nonconductive (ie, non-electrolyte) fluids are not required.</p><p>Fluid absorption into the vascular space begins when the fluid pressure exceeds the venous pressure (about 10 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Minimize fluid pressure'</a> below).</p><p>In addition to fluid absorption directly into the vascular space (intravasation), perforation of a viscus during surgery can result in rapid extravasation of irrigation fluid into the surrounding space. With perforation of the bladder or uterine wall, fluid will extravasate into the peritoneal cavity or retroperitoneum. With perforation of the prostatic capsule during transurethral resection (TUR), fluid extravasates into the periprostatic space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/12,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15-17</a>]. Fluid can also traverse the Fallopian tubes during hysteroscopy; however, a history of prior tubal ligation does not seem to affect the volume of fluid absorbed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>]. The fall in serum sodium occurs more slowly following extravasation compared to intravasation (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Time course of hyponatremia'</a> below).</p><p>Prolonged operative time permits greater opportunity for fluid absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. However, the available data are not sufficient to define an operative time threshold beyond which excessive fluid absorption is likely to occur. For TUR of the prostate, fluid absorption is greater during the second half of the procedure, regardless of operating time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitor fluid absorbed'</a> below).</p><p>The type of anesthesia may influence fluid absorption in women undergoing endometrial resection, although the available data are conflicting. In a randomized trial of 24 women undergoing hysteroscopy, fluid absorption was significantly higher with epidural compared to general anesthesia (648 versus 381 mL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. By contrast, a subsequent retrospective cohort study found that fluid absorption was highest with general anesthesia, less with epidural anesthesia, and lowest with local anesthesia and intravenous sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The administration of intracervical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> to reduce bleeding during hysteroscopy appears to protect against the development of hyponatremia by reducing local absorption of the irrigation fluid. In a randomized trial of 33 women undergoing hysteroscopic endometrial ablation, intracervical administration of vasopressin during hysteroscopy was associated with a significantly lower plasma glycine concentration at 20 minutes (8.8 versus 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and a nonsignificantly smaller reduction in plasma sodium from baseline (2.2 versus 6.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> at 40 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Possible protection against hyponatremia was also noted in an observational study of intraprostatic administration of vasopressin in men undergoing TUR of the prostate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast to the possible benefits of intracervical or intraprostatic vasopressin, the systemic effects of vasopressin would be expected to exacerbate any reduction in serum sodium by limiting water excretion.</p><p>There are limited data regarding patient-specific risk factors for excess fluid absorption and hyponatremia following TUR of the prostate or bladder or hysteroscopy. For men undergoing TUR of the prostate, smoking was associated with fluid absorption exceeding 1000 mL in a retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The physiologic basis of such an effect, if real, might be that the blood supply to the prostate increases due to the variable degree of hypoxemia that accompanies smoking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF HYPONATREMIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume and rate of fluid absorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The likelihood of developing hyponatremia and associated symptoms and complications (eg, nausea, cerebral edema) following transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate or bladder or hysteroscopy is related to the rate, volume of absorption, osmolality, and volume of distribution of the nonconductive (ie, non-electrolyte) irrigation solution, and the rapidity of metabolism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excretion of the solute and the water load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/10,11,15,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,15,27-32</a>]. There is a direct correlation between the glycine deficit (the difference between the infused and collected volumes of the glycine irrigant) and the fall in serum sodium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74942\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74942 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>The relationship between the glycine deficit and the reduction in serum sodium and the development of nausea and cerebral edema on computed tomography was illustrated in a study of 20 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ten women who absorbed less than 500 mL of glycine irrigant had a mean decrease in serum sodium of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> and did not have symptoms of hyponatremia or changes suggestive of cerebral edema on computed tomography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six women who absorbed 1000 mL or more had a reduction in serum sodium of 13 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L;</span> all had nausea and changes suggestive of cerebral edema on computed tomography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four women absorbed 500 to 1000 mL of glycine irrigant; three had cerebral edema, two of whom had reductions in serum sodium of 10 and 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>.</p><p/><p>As noted above, a higher volume of irrigant fluid absorption is required to produce the same degree of hyponatremia in men who have a higher lean body weight and total body water than women (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above).</p><p>The rate of fluid absorption is probably also an important factor in the development of hyponatremia. TUR and hysteroscopy procedures generally last for one hour or less, so fluid absorption is relatively rapid. One study suggested that a rate of fluid absorption in excess of 200 to 300 mL per 10 minutes is required to develop hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Fluid absorption thresholds at which the procedure should be halted are discussed below (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Halt procedure at absorption thresholds'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Time course of hyponatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time course of the development of hyponatremia varies with the site of fluid absorption. Fluid absorbed into the vascular space (intravasation) rapidly lowers the serum sodium. This fluid presumably enters the vascular space directly through vessels opened during the procedure.</p><p>The time course is more prolonged when perforation of a viscus during surgery leads to extravasation of irrigation fluid into the surrounding space. The serum sodium is usually lowest one to two hours after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and the degree of hyponatremia is only about one-third that expected from absorption directly into the vascular space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/14,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,33</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above).</p><p>Subsequent events depend in part upon the irrigant used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycine enters cells over several hours and, by four hours, glycine is almost equally distributed between the extracellular and intracellular compartments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Glycine entry into cells is associated with osmotic water movement from the extracellular fluid into the cells, which is probably responsible for the gradual increase in serum sodium that begins as soon as 10 to 20 minutes after the development of hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/11,28,31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,28,31,34</a>].</p><p/><p>In a series of 20 patients described above, the six patients with a glycine deficit (the difference between the infused and collected volumes of the glycine irrigant) of 1000 mL or more and two patients with a glycine deficit of about 700 mL had a decrease in serum sodium of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The associated electrolyte-free water loss will raise the serum sodium concentration and the increase in sodium excretion will enhance correction of the volume overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Time course of osmolar shifts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum or plasma osmolality is normally determined by the sum of the osmotic contributions of the three major solutes in the plasma: sodium salts, glucose, and urea.

Thus, in the absence of diabetes mellitus or renal failure, the serum sodium concentration is the most important determinant of serum osmolality.</p><p>These contributions are illustrated in the following formula, which can be used to estimate the serum osmolality (Sosm):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Sosm &#160;= &#160;(2 &#160;x &#160;[serum Na+]) &#160;+ &#160;([serum <span class=\"nowrap\">glucose]/18)</span> &#160;+ &#160;(blood urea <span class=\"nowrap\">nitrogen/2</span>.8)</p></div></div><p>The serum sodium is multiplied by two to account for the accompanying anion (chloride and bicarbonate) and the divisors 18 and 2.8 convert units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> into <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/L</span>.

Thus, the initial serum osmolality will be reduced with retention of glycine, or sorbitol. By comparison, the 5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> solution is isosmotic and the initial serum osmolality will be relatively unchanged.</p><p>With all three irrigation fluids, there will be a large serum (or plasma) osmolal gap due to the presence of the solute contained in the irrigant. The serum osmolal gap is equal to the difference between the measured serum osmolality, which will include the organic solute, and the serum osmolality estimated from the above formula, which does not include the irrigant solute. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-osmolal-gap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum osmolal gap&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These relationships have been described during both TUR of the prostate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/34-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-39</a>] and hysteroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/30,31,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31,40,41</a>]. In a prospective study of 100 patients who underwent TUR with glycine irrigant, for example, 10 patients developed neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The mean serum sodium fell by an average of 17.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> which should have lowered the serum osmolality by about 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>. However, the serum osmolality fell by only 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> due to the osmotic effect of glycine. The modest reduction in serum osmolality alone would not be expected to produce such marked neurologic symptoms (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of neurologic symptoms'</a> below).</p><p>The serum osmolal gap gradually disappears since glycine enters cells and is metabolized, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, and all three irrigants are excreted in the urine. As a result, the serum osmolality will gradually fall toward the level predicted from the serum sodium, glucose, and urea concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/31,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,42</a>].</p><p>One might expect the urine to be maximally dilute (less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span> at this time to permit excretion of the excess water.

A direct approach is calculation of the fluid deficit (also called the glycine deficit), which is the difference between the volume of irrigation fluid administered and the volume removed by suction. Fluid is collected through suction tubing attached to the operative device (hysteroscope or cystoscope) and in plastic drapes beneath the patient.</p><p>In hysteroscopy, the fluid deficit can be determined with an automated system or manually by the operating room staff.

This acute hypoosmolality is associated with acute cerebral edema. The cerebral edema is due to a water shift into the brain from the hypotonic extracellular fluid and is thought to play a central etiologic role in the neurologic symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the pathogenesis of neurologic symptoms following the absorption of non-electrolyte irrigation fluids is less well defined. As mentioned in the preceding section, the hyponatremia associated with nonconductive (ie, non-electrolyte) irrigation fluids is associated with a less pronounced or no fall in serum osmolality due to the presence of glycine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> in the irrigation fluid and the extracellular fluid.

The rate of correction should be slower (8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> maximum increase in the first 24 hours) in patients who present with hyponatremia more than 48 hours after the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Osmotic demyelination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, optimal therapy has not been defined in symptomatic patients who have severe hyponatremia, but a normal or near normal serum osmolality (eg, greater than 270 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Absorption of these irrigation fluids produces hyponatremia with varying degrees of hypoosmolality. Neurologic manifestations can occur when fluid absorption exceeds 500 mL and particularly 1000 mL. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)<br/><br/>These problems can be avoided with bipolar electrosurgery, which permits the use of isotonic saline irrigation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Avoid use of nonconductive irrigants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irrigant-associated hyponatremia can be prevented or minimized by reducing fluid absorption. This is accomplished with the use of low infusion pressures, limitation of surgery duration, by monitoring the degree of fluid absorption, and by aborting the procedure at prespecified absorption thresholds. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitor fluid absorbed'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a nonconductive solution is used, we suggest the use of an automated rather than a manual fluid monitoring system (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) and we recommend terminating the procedure if the fluid deficit reaches 1000 to 1500 mL in women (depending in part upon patient size) and 2000 mL in men (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Halt procedure at absorption thresholds'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and malaise. This may be followed by headache, lethargy, and obtundation, and eventually renal failure, seizures, coma and respiratory arrest. Patients exposed to glycine irrigant may complain of visual deficits or blindness. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of patients who become symptomatic during or following one of these procedures, as well as the evaluation of all patients who have had prolonged surgery or a large volume of fluid absorbed includes measurement of the plasma sodium and osmolality and calculation of the plasma osmolal gap. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend no specific therapy for asymptomatic hyponatremia or, when symptoms cannot be assessed because of anesthesia, for a serum sodium reduction of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> or less (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic hyponatremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with symptoms of hyponatremia and reduced plasma osmolality, we recommend treatment with hypertonic saline (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest that 3 percent saline be given as a 100 mL (1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> bolus that can be repeated twice at 10-minute intervals, if necessary (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The efficacy and safety of such therapy is uncertain in hyponatremic patients who have a normal or near normal serum osmolality (eg, greater than 275 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Role of hypertonic saline'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is little concern about overly rapid correction of the hyponatremia following TUR or hysteroscopy due to the extremely short duration of the hyponatremia. However, hyponatremia should not be overcorrected. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic hyponatremia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe renal dysfunction and those with the combination of severe symptoms, marked hyponatremia, and a normal or near normal serum osmolality (eg, greater than 275 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg),</span> we suggest urgent hemodialysis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Role of hemodialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom major fluid absorption occurs following intraoperative perforation of the uterus, bladder, or prostatic fossa, surgical drainage is an option to remove the deposited fluid.
