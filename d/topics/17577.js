They are usually mild or asymptomatic, and do not require treatment. In some cases, however, infection is associated with sufficiently severe complications that treatment is indicated and may be lifesaving.</p><p>The major clinical manifestations that can occur with B19 infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema infectiosum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis or arthralgia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient aplastic crisis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal hydrops</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic infection with or without anemia</p><p/><p>The major issues related to the treatment of symptomatic B19 infection and to prevention of infection will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, transmission, clinical syndromes, diagnosis, and management of parvovirus B19 infection in pregnancy are discussed in detail separately.

In vitro studies that demonstrate suppression of B19 replication with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a> warrant further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythema infectiosum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythema infectiosum (&quot;fifth&quot; disease) is a self-limited, mild illness most often occurring in children. There is no specific therapy and usually no indication for symptomatic treatment. In some patients, symptomatic therapy for arthralgias, arthritis, or pruritus may be indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Arthritis or arthralgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthritis or arthralgia are most often reported in adult females but can occur in either gender and at any age. The joint symptoms usually last one to two weeks, but can persist for weeks, months, and even years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific viruses that cause arthritis&quot;, section on 'Parvovirus'</a>.)</p><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can provide symptomatic relief. Intravenous immune (IVIG) has been given to two patients with presumed chronic B19 infection and chronic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The arthritis was not cured, but there may have been a short-term decrease in symptoms. These limited data do not support the use of IVIG treatment for B19-associated arthropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient aplastic crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute parvovirus B19 is a cause of transient aplastic crisis (TAC) in patients with certain underlying hematologic abnormalities, in which the interruption of red cell production in this setting rapidly leads to a severe anemia. </p><p>The anemia is often sufficiently severe (hemoglobin levels below 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> with few or no reticulocytes) to require transfusion until the patient's immune response eliminates the infection and red cell production returns. As an example, in a series of 62 sickle cell patients with TAC, 54 (87 percent) required blood transfusions, 39 (63 percent) were hospitalized, and one (1.6 percent) died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The one death illustrates the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment with transfusion therapy if indicated by the patient's condition.</p><p>The usual course of parvovirus associated-anemia is spontaneous resolution within a few days to weeks. Beyond supportive red blood cell transfusion, more aggressive therapy with IVIG is generally limited to patients with chronic B19 infection and chronic anemia (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic infection also can occur, producing anemia or other signs or symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic infection with anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with chronic B19 infection and anemia have received immunosuppressive therapy for cancer, leukemia, or tissue transplantation, have a congenital immunodeficiency, or have HIV-associated immunodeficiency. Reports of pure red cell aplasia have occurred in HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Most of these reports have occurred prior to the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART). </p><p>In a retrospective study of 10 patients with pure red cell aplasia and proven B19 infection who were treated with IVIG, anemia resolved in 9 of 10 within a mean of 80 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients received a mean of 2.7 IVIG courses at an average dose of 1.3 &plusmn; 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per course. The only patient who did not respond to IVIG had underlying myelodysplasia. Among the seven patients with available follow-up blood B19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results, five had negative PCR results within a mean of 97 days (range 35 to 159 days). None of the nine responders had a relapse during 12 months of follow-up. In a review of published studies that was part of the same report, hemoglobin level was corrected after the first IVIG course in 124 of 133 patients (93 percent) with pure red cell aplasia caused by B19 infection, but disease relapsed in 42 (34 percent) at a mean of 4.3 months. </p><p>Patients have been treated with several different IVIG regimens, such as 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of commercial IVIG for 5 or 10 days or 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for 3 days, both with good results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. One HIV-infected patient with chronic B19 infection and anemia apparently responded to treatment with 5 mL of intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most literature that exists on treating anemia in B19-infected individuals describes treatment schedules for those individuals who are coinfected with HIV. Suggested treatments for HIV-infected individuals with pure red cell aplasia related to B19 coinfection have included regimens of IVIG with 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/kg/day</span> for two to five days. Relapses in these patients have been successfully treated with maintenance IVIG at doses of 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/kg/day</span> every four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p>Recurrence of anemia and reappearance or increases in B19 DNA in serum have usually responded to additional courses of IVIG treatment. Furthermore, if the immunodeficiency improves (eg, after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy or with the initiation of antiretroviral therapy for HIV), chronic infection and anemia may resolve spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic infection without anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic B19 infection has been demonstrated in patients without anemia or underlying immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. It is not clear if IVIG treatment is helpful in this setting. One such patient with thrombocytopenia received IVIG without an obvious response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], while two patients with presumed chronic infection and arthritis had no virologic but possibly a transient clinical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In comparison, three patients with systemic vasculitis had an apparent clinical and virologic response after IVIG therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Further study is needed to determine the role of IVIG in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92115240\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of fetal anemia and hydrops secondary to parvovirus B19 infection is discussed elsewhere.

Immunoprophylactic therapy has been considered in some instances, but insufficient data are available to determine if it is efficacious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventing transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attention to good infection control practices should reduce the risk of transmitting B19. Studies of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, which are also spread by person-to-person contact, fomites, and large droplet aerosol, and are stable in the environment, suggest that hand washing and not sharing food or drinks is likely to prevent, at least partially, spread of B19 in a variety of settings. One report of B19 infections in a hospital suggested that good hygienic practices by staff may have decreased their risk of acquiring infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Staff who reported washing their hands rarely or only occasionally after contact with patients had a higher infection rate (p = 0.07).</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that patients with TAC be placed on droplet isolation precautions for seven days and that immunodeficient patients with chronic infection be placed on droplet precautions for the duration of their hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In comparison, patients with normal immune systems are probably not infectious after the onset of B19-associated rash, arthralgias, or arthritis, when a robust antibody response would take place and dramatically reduce the patient's viral load.</p><p>Modes of transmission are discussed elsewhere.

As noted above, there is no specific prevention available. Frequently, during B19 outbreaks, supervisors, health care workers, pregnant women, and others will ask whether avoiding the workplace or outbreak settings such as schools or child care centers will decrease the risk to the fetus. CDC recommends that pregnant women be informed about the risks of infection and make their own decision after consultation with health care workers, public health officials, and family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Understanding the risk is essential to making this decision. The primary risk is fetal death, and this risk is given by the following equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p>Rate of fetal death = (rate of susceptibility x rate of infection from the exposure) &divide; (rate of fetal death with infection)</p><p>Estimates for each of these factors are available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women in their childbearing years, between 40 and 60 percent, depending on the community and antibody detection assay used, will test positive for B19 IgG antibodies and are presumably not susceptible to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

However, some uncommon severe complications of infection may warrant specific treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50679\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50679 \">table 1</a>). There is no specific antiviral drug available for the treatment of parvovirus B19 infection.

Chronic infection may also resolve with a decrease in immunosuppression or immune reconstitution, if possible. It is unclear if IVIG is beneficial in the setting of chronic parvovirus B19 infection without anemia.
