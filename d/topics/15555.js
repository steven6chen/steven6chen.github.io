However, ultraviolet (UV) radiation (290 to 400 nm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70045 \">figure 1</a>)) is responsible for several acute and chronic detrimental effects on human skin, including sunburn, photoaging, and skin cancer.</p><p>Ultraviolet B (UVB) (290 to 320 nm), which represents only 5 percent of the UV radiation reaching the earth's surface, includes the biologically most active wavelengths. UVB is responsible for sunburn, inflammation, hyperpigmentation, and photocarcinogenesis. &#160;</p><p>Approximately 95 percent of the UV radiation reaching the earth surface is ultraviolet A (UVA) (320 to 400 nm). UVA2 (320 to 340 nm), which constitutes approximately 25 percent of the UVA band, produces similar effects on the skin as UVB. UVA1 (340 to 400 nm) is less potent than UVA2 and has a decreased ability to induce erythema. UVA contributes to photoaging, has a major role in pigment darkening, and may be involved in skin carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Photoprotection, which includes sun avoidance during peak hours, sun-protective clothing, and sunscreens, is crucial to prevent or reduce the potential harms associated with UV exposure.</p><p>Sunscreens and sun-protective clothing are reviewed here. Sunburns, photosensitivity disorders, and photoaging are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sunburn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photoaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photoaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9546099\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF SUNSCREENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sunscreens are topical preparations containing filters that reflect or absorb radiation in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70045 \">figure 1</a>). In the United States, where sunscreens are considered to be over-the-counter drugs, 17 different UV filters are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as active ingredients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73127\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73127 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Many other UV filters are available in Europe, Canada, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Sunscreens are classified as organic (formerly known as chemical sunscreens) and inorganic (formerly known as physical sunscreens). Broad-spectrum sunscreens are generally combinations of sunscreen products that are able to absorb both ultraviolet B (UVB) and ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66298617\"><span class=\"h2\">Organic filters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organic filters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73127\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73127 \">table 1</a>) include a variety of aromatic compounds that absorb UV radiation and convert it to a negligible amount of heat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some organic agents such as cinnamates and salicylates specifically absorb UVB. Among cinnamates, octinoxate is the most widely used UVB filter worldwide.</p><p>Benzophenones provide UVB and short-wavelength UVA (UVA2) protection. Oxybenzone (benzophenone-3) is the most commonly used UVA filter worldwide. Avobenzone is an effective filter for long-wavelength UVA radiation (UVA1) but is extremely photolabile and needs to be stabilized with other compounds such as octocrylene, a weak UVB absorber. </p><p>Broad-spectrum sunscreens are generally produced by combining filters with varying UV absorption spectra. As an example, avobenzone can be combined with UVB filters such as homosalate and octisalate to yield broad-spectrum coverage. A new generation of broad-spectrum organic filters has been developed in Europe, including methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) and bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenol triazine (Tinosorb S), terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid (Mexoryl SX), and drometrizole trisiloxane (Mexoryl XL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Mexoryl SX and Mexoryl XL are photostable broad-spectrum agents absorbing UVB and short wavelength UVA (UVA2). Both prevent UV-induced pigmentation and show a synergistic effect when used in combination. Mexoryl SX has been available in the United States since 2006 in combination with avobenzone and octocrylene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25103687\"><span class=\"h2\">Inorganic filters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inorganic filters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73127\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73127 \">table 1</a>) are mineral compounds such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a> and titanium dioxide that are believed to reflect and scatter UV light over a wide range of wavelengths. However, studies have shown that these compounds, and in particular micronized preparations, absorb rather than reflect UV radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Inorganic sunscreens are stable, and in contrast to organic filters, have a low irritating and sensitizing potential. Inorganic sunscreens offer broad-spectrum protection against UVB, short-wavelength UVA (UVA2), and long-wavelength UVA (UVA1).</p><p>Older inorganic sunscreens contained large-size particles and formed a cosmetically unacceptable and occlusive white film on the skin. To overcome this cosmetic shortcoming, nanotechnology methods have been used to produce titanium dioxide or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a> particles in the size range of 5 to 20 nm. Nanoparticle products form a more transparent film on the skin while providing effective UVA and UVB protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the utilization of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles into sunscreens has raised questions regarding possible alteration of their absorption spectrum and the potential for percutaneous penetration and toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9546127\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9424584\"><span class=\"h2\">Labeling and regulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sun protection factor (SPF) measures the sunscreen's ability to protect against a sunburn reaction, which is due primarily to UVB. The SPF refers to the ratio of the minimal dose of solar radiation that produces perceptible erythema (minimal erythema dose) on sunscreen-protected skin compared with unprotected skin. The SPF is assessed in experimental conditions using a light source that simulates the solar radiation on the skin of light-skinned volunteers who have applied an amount of sunscreen corresponding to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/cm<sup>2</sup></span>. (See <a href=\"#H9424613\" class=\"local\">'SPF'</a> below.)</p><p>The SPF does not adequately measure protection from UVA, which encompasses 95 percent of the total UV radiation that reaches the earth at sea level. The lack of adequate information on the degree of UVA protection provided by sunscreens prompted the FDA to issue new regulations for labeling sunscreen products, which became effective in 2012. Under the new regulations, only sunscreen products that pass the FDA&rsquo;s test for protection against both UVA and UVB rays will be labeled as &quot;broad spectrum.&quot;</p><p>Broad-spectrum sunscreen products that contain an SPF of 15 or higher may have the following statement on the label: &quot;If used as directed with other sun-protection measures, decreases the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun.&quot; Those that fail the broad-spectrum test or have an SPF &lt;15 must add the following to their label: &quot;Skin <span class=\"nowrap\">cancer/skin</span> aging alert: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, not skin cancer or early skin aging.&quot;</p><p>The FDA also recommends that the SPF level be capped at 50 and that sunscreens with SPF &gt;50 be labeled as SPF = 50+. The FDA no longer allows sunscreen products to be labeled &quot;sweat proof&quot; or &quot;water proof.&quot; Sunscreens can be labeled as &quot;water resistant&quot; or &quot;very water resistant&quot; if they maintain their SPF after 40 or 80 minutes of swimming or sweating, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The UVA protection is not rated in the United States. In Europe, where a number of UVA sunscreen agents (eg, Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Mexoryl XL) have been available for many years, a standardized logo (the letters UVA in a circle) and a 5-star rating system for UVA protection has been recommended to the industry by the European Commission. The UVA protection level refers to the ratio of <span class=\"nowrap\">UVB/UVA</span> protection and is required to be at least one-third of the labeled SPF. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11208302\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO SHOULD USE SUNSCREEN?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All individuals, regardless of skin phototype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 2</a>), are subject to the potential adverse effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and will benefit from sunscreen use. However, sunscreens are especially useful for individuals with light skin (phototypes I, II, and III) who are more susceptible to the acute (sunburn) and chronic (photoaging, skin cancer) adverse effects of excessive sun exposure.</p><p>Light-skinned individuals should regularly use sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher when performing outdoor activities in sunny weather, especially in regions with a high level of insolation. Because individuals typically do not apply sunscreen in the recommended amount (approximately 1 to 1.5 ounces or 6 to 9 teaspoons per total body application), they may benefit from a higher SPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

In addition to SPF and performance characteristics, the cosmetic appeal of sunscreen products appears to be an important selection criterion used by consumers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9424613\"><span class=\"h2\">SPF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SPF value primarily measures the level of protection against ultraviolet B (UVB) and ultraviolet A2 (UVA2) and is based on the ratio of the minimal erythema dose on sunscreen-protected skin compared with unprotected skin. The relationship between SPF and absorption of UVB radiation is not linear. In fact, when applied in sufficient amount, the amount of UVB radiation absorbed by SPF 15, 30, and 50 sunscreen products is 93, 97, and 98 percent, respectively. However, since the amount of UVB delivered to the skin through a sunscreen is reduced in a nearly linear way with increasing SPF, a sunscreen with SPF of 30 is twice as protective as one of 15 in preventing erythema. Products with SPF &gt;50 provide only a negligible increase in the protection from UV radiation.</p><p>Sunscreen products with SPF 15 are generally recommended for daily use. Sunscreen-containing cosmetics (eg, facial moisturizers, foundations) may improve the photoprotection compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Most cosmetic products are formulated to provide a SPF of 15 to 30 and may or may not be labeled as broad spectrum. Cosmetics providing broad-spectrum protection should be preferred to those containing only UVB filters.</p><p>Broad-spectrum sunscreen products with SPF 30 or higher are recommended for individuals performing outdoor work, sports, or recreational activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9424629\"><span class=\"h2\">Spectrum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Broad-spectrum sunscreens that offer sufficient protection against UVB, UVA2, and ultraviolet A1 (UVA1) are preferred to products containing only UVB filters, since both UVA and UVB are involved in skin photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. Although most UVB filters, particularly those with a high SPF, provide some protection against UVA2 radiation, the only three ingredients that satisfy the definition of UVA1 protection are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avobenzone (organic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Zinc oxide</a> (inorganic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Titanium dioxide (inorganic)</p><p/><p>Avobenzone is typically combined with UVA2 and UVB organic filters (eg, cinnamates, benzophenones, or octocrylene) or inorganic filters to achieve broad-spectrum protection and photostability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73127\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73127 \">table 1</a>). Sunscreens containing only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> titanium dioxide in adequate concentration provide protection against the entire UV spectrum. However, inorganic filters are often combined with organic filters to maximize efficacy and cosmetic acceptability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9424637\"><span class=\"h2\">Formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research has focused on the development of cosmetically appealing sunscreens that ensure compliance. A common reason for noncompliance is the stickiness of the product, which is greater with higher SPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A survey of the top sunscreen products on an online retailer found that cosmetic elegance, including texture, absorbability, absence of greasiness, and pleasant smell, was the most commonly positive feature of a sunscreen product cited by consumers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Since sunscreen ingredients are oil-soluble, the most widely commercialized sunscreen products (eg, lotions and creams) are oil-in-water emulsions, in which microscopic drops of oily materials are dispersed in a continuous water phase that typically contains also other polar ingredients like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> or glycols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Lotions are thinner and less greasy than creams and are generally preferred for application over large body areas.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Ethanol/oil-based</span> products in combination with polymeric thickeners are used to manufacture liquid, spray, or gel sunscreens. These formulations are fast-drying and leave a cooling sensation on the skin due to their quick evaporation but may be irritating. Gels and sprays are preferred by patients with acne or by individuals who work or perform sports activities outdoors in hot weather. However, ethanol-based sunscreens may leave an uneven product film on the skin after evaporation, providing an inconsistent SPF performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4077444091\"><span class=\"h3\">Water resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water (and sweat) resistance is a key feature to consider when selecting a sunscreen product to use while working or practicing sports or recreational activities outdoors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The terms &quot;water-resistant&quot; and &quot;very water-resistant&quot; mean that the SPF is maintained after 40 or 80 minutes of activity in water or sweating, respectively. The water resistance depends on the vehicle in which the sunscreen is formulated as well as the active ingredient itself. Some types of sunscreens require several minutes after the application to allow the product to form a water-resistant film.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58364834\"><span class=\"h2\">For infants and young children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/news-features-and-safety-tips/pages/Sun-and-Water-Safety-Tips.aspx?nfstatus=401&nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&nfstatusdescription=ERROR:+No+local+token&amp;token=1jFdoVGSCLx8WTy1Bo62sUSF8ACdEubnFljQCUCff+W2/Kox4OyXNuUlvvu5wtYHAY6xhnF/oj3YryZ6WMQlfg9QeNaJu4CNDdmkjbSaxZMo2jjMZh6AZrl7gFuu80uY+kwgGDVeTOjcrFvjQSvU4V2LW0VGLu7qxXqI5R/N0gvAX1XdVl1/7+QOS8rNDcmuvIOmuKQ5drlA14MeU0SuRg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=13751\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommends avoiding the use of sunscreen products in infants younger than six months. However, when adequate clothing and shade are not available, a minimal amount of sunscreen with at least 15 SPF can be applied to small areas, such as the infant's face and the back of the hands.</p><p>Since infants have an immature skin barrier, sunscreen products should be nonirritating to the skin and eyes and have a low sensitization potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although the frequency of adverse reactions to sunscreens in children has not been determined, photosensitivity and allergic contact dermatitis from organic filters have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11208635\" class=\"local\">'Irritant and allergic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>Oil-based emulsions of inorganic filters (ie, titanium dioxide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a>) are preferred to organic filters for infants and children because they offer broad-spectrum protection and have minimal irritation, sensitization, and skin penetration potential. (See <a href=\"#H25103687\" class=\"local\">'Inorganic filters'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9546113\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPER USE OF SUNSCREENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sunscreens must be applied liberally, repeatedly, and to all sun-exposed parts of the skin to provide effective protection. To achieve the full sun protection factor (SPF) value on the product label, the amount (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span> of sunscreen necessary to cover sun-exposed skin of an average-sized adult when on a beach vacation is approximately equivalent to the amount required to fill a 1-ounce (30 mL) shot glass or to 6 teaspoons. However, larger amounts, up to 45 mL or 9 teaspoons, may be needed for optimal coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Most people do not apply such a large amount [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Because of the nonlinear relationship between effective SPF and the amount of sunscreen applied, using only half of the proper amount (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span> would provide approximately one third of the SPF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Therefore, SPF 30 or greater sunscreens should be recommended to compensate. As an alternative, double application has been proposed as an effective method to ensure that the correct amount per surface unit is applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63385731\"><span class=\"h2\">The &quot;teaspoon rule&quot;</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care providers can instruct patients to adopt simple application techniques that ensure an even application of adequate amounts of sunscreen to the exposed areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. One of these is the so-called &quot;teaspoon rule.&quot; It involves the application of approximately 1 teaspoon (visually measured) of sunscreen to the face and neck area, a total of 2 teaspoons to the front and back torso, 1 teaspoon to each upper extremity, and 2 teaspoons to each lower extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3472540479\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Timing of application is important.

Reapplication at least every two hours is necessary. Because all sunscreens are washed off upon swimming or sweating, reapplication after each water exposure (swimming) is needed even for sunscreen products labeled as &quot;water resistant&quot; (SPF maintained after 40 minutes of activity in water or sweating) or &quot;very water resistant&quot; (SPF maintained after 80 minutes of activity in water or sweating).

In the United States, a survey of over 4000 adults aged 18 years and older found that approximately 14 percent of men and 30 percent of women regularly used sunscreen on the face and other exposed skin when outside in the sun for more than one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Regular use of sunscreen was associated with having sun-sensitive skin, higher annual household income, performing aerobic activity, and having children younger than 18. However, the use of sun protection measures other than sunscreen (eg, wearing a hat or protective clothing) was not investigated. The results of this study indicate a need for more effective sun safety interventions targeting men, individuals with a lower perceived susceptibility to sun damage, and those for whom cost may be a barrier to sunscreen use.</p><p>Of major concern is the low level of sunscreen use among children. In a series of more than 10,000 children of nurses from the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study, only 34 percent of children aged 11 to 18 were using sunscreen, and 83 percent had at least one sunburn during the previous summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a Netherlands survey of 1103 parents of children 6 to 12 years of age, approximately 30 percent regularly applied sunscreen to their children&rsquo;s skin during spring and summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Broad-spectrum sunscreens are generally combinations of sunscreen products that absorb both UVB and UVA radiations. (See <a href=\"#H25103687\" class=\"local\">'Inorganic filters'</a> above and <a href=\"#H66298617\" class=\"local\">'Organic filters'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Everyone, regardless of skin phototype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 2</a>), is subject to the potential adverse effects of UV radiation and may benefit from sunscreen. However, sunscreens are especially useful for individuals with light skin (phototypes I, II, and III) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 2</a>) who are more susceptible to sunburn, photoaging, and skin cancer. (See <a href=\"#H11208302\" class=\"local\">'Who should use sunscreen?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Broad-spectrum products with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher are recommended for individuals performing outdoor work, sports, or recreational activities. (See <a href=\"#H9546106\" class=\"local\">'Selection of sunscreen products'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunscreens must be applied liberally, repeatedly, and to all sun-exposed parts of the skin to provide effective protection. Simple practical rules, such as the &quot;teaspoon rule,&quot; may be used to determine the adequate amount of sunscreen to apply to certain body areas. Sunscreen should be applied 15 to 30 minutes before sun exposure to allow the formation of a protective film on the skin and reapplied every two hours. (See <a href=\"#H9546113\" class=\"local\">'Proper use of sunscreens'</a> above and <a href=\"#H63385731\" class=\"local\">'The &quot;teaspoon rule&quot;'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunscreens generally have an excellent safety profile, and there is no evidence of systemic adverse effects related to percutaneous absorption. However, sunscreens may rarely induce allergic and irritant contact dermatitis, phototoxic and photoallergic reactions, or contact urticaria. (See <a href=\"#H9546127\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing clothes is important for sun protection. The degree of photoprotection provided by clothes is defined by the ultraviolet protection factor (UPF), which indicates how effective a fabric is at blocking out solar ultraviolet radiation. Yarn composition, tightness of the weave, and dark colors increase a garment's UPF.
