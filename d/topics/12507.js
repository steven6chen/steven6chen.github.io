Nutritional support may be indicated for malnourished individuals requiring surgical intervention, or for healthy individuals undergoing major surgery with an anticipated lengthy recovery time to return of normal gastrointestinal function; however, it can be unclear when it is appropriate to intervene. The notion that malnutrition can affect outcomes in surgical patients was first reported in 1936 in a study showing that malnourished patients undergoing ulcer surgery had a 33 percent mortality rate compared with 3.5 percent in well-nourished individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A prospective study of 500 patients, including 200 surgical patients, admitted to a teaching hospital in England found that 40 percent of patients were undernourished on presentation, and patients lost an average of 5.4 percent of their body weight during their hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The nutritional assessment of surgical patients, options for, and potential benefits of nutritional support are reviewed here. An overview of parenteral and enteral nutrition and issues related to nutritional support in critically ill patients, and other specific populations (eg, cancer, burns, lung disease) are discussed in separate topic reviews. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONSEQUENCES OF MALNUTRITION IN SURGICAL PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduced food intake results in loss of fat, muscle, skin, and ultimately bone and viscera, with subsequent weight loss, and expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Nutritional requirements fall as an individual's body mass decreases, probably reflecting more efficient utilization of ingested food and a reduction in work capacity at the cellular level. However, the combination of decreased tissue mass and reduced work capacity impedes normal homeostatic responses to stressors such as surgery or critical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The stress of surgery or trauma creates a hypermetabolic state, increasing protein and energy requirements. Macronutrients (fat, protein, and glycogen) from the labile reserves of fat tissue and skeletal muscle are redistributed to more metabolically active tissues such as the liver and visceral organs. This response can lead to the onset of protein calorie malnutrition (defined as a negative balance of 100 g of nitrogen and 10,000 kcal) within a few days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The rate of development of postoperative malnutrition in a given individual depends upon their preexisting nutritional status, nature and complexity of the surgical procedure, and the degree of hypermetabolism. </p><p>Malnutrition causes a number of negative consequences, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/4,5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased susceptibility to infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor wound healing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased frequency of decubitus ulcers </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overgrowth of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal nutrient losses through the stool</p><p/><p>Of particular concern for patients undergoing surgery are the risks of postoperative infection and poor wound healing. Malnutrition leads to immune system dysfunction by impairing complement activation and production, bacterial opsonization, and the function of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One series of underfed patients identified subnormal skin reactions to Candida and low levels of antibodies to various phytomitogens, suggesting that humoral and cell-mediated immunity are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary immunodeficiency due to underlying disease states, environmental exposures, and miscellaneous causes&quot;, section on 'Malnutrition'</a>.) </p><p>Patients with protein energy malnutrition also have slower rates of wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], although most wounds will eventually heal on their own [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Additional adverse effects associated with malnutrition were identified in a study of 2743 patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients with preoperative hypoalbuminemia alone or in association with chronic liver disease or heart failure were more likely to have postoperative organ dysfunction (cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, neurologic), gastrointestinal bleeding, nosocomial infections, increased days on mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the intensive care unit, and inpatient death. A body mass index (BMI) &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> was associated with lower morbidity and mortality compared with a higher BMI; however, this finding in this study contrasts with other studies. BMI is an imperfect measure of nutritional status and should be used in conjunction with other clinical indicators.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT IN THE SURGICAL PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first task when considering perioperative nutritional recommendations is to assess whether or not the patient has malnutrition. The basic principle of dietary and nutritional assessment in the general population is discussed elsewhere. Important aspects of nutritional assessment that pertain to surgical patients are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-assessment-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary assessment in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Based upon expert consensus, a diagnosis of malnutrition requires that the patient exhibit two or more of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient energy intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of muscle mass</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of subcutaneous fat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized or generalized fluid accumulation that may sometimes mask weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished functional status as measured by handgrip strength</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466002228\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several aspects of the past medical history are of particular importance, including chronic disease (particularly diabetes), infection, recent hospitalization, and prior surgery (particularly gastrointestinal surgery). </p><p>On review of systems, a history of weight loss or gain is important. Any recent losses or gains (and whether they were purposeful or not) prior to the hospital stay should be assessed. The details of the current hospitalization also play a central role. Newly admitted trauma patients who are otherwise well have drastically different needs from patients who have had surgery several weeks in the past but have remained hospitalized due to complications.</p><p>In addition to collecting information on current medications, nonprescription medicines and other supplements should be noted. The use of dietary supplements, such as protein shakes, should also be determined. Lastly, any allergies or food intolerances should also be noted. A diet history should be collected from the patient, family, or care facility. Although there are several methods of dietary assessment, the most useful and straightforward may be to assess the usual intake on an average day before hospitalization or before the onset of the current illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>In addition to vital signs and a general physical examination, the following should be noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Height and weight (calculate body mass index [BMI] using weight in kg divided by height in meters squared (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), or using a nomogram) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65305 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General: Loss of subcutaneous fat, any generalized fluid accumulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head and neck exam: Hair loss, bitemporal wasting, conjunctival pallor, xerosis, glossitis, bleeding or sores on the gums and oral mucosa, angular cheilosis or stomatitis, dentition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular: Evidence of heart failure or high-output state</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck: Thyromegaly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremities: Edema, loss of muscle mass</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic: Evidence of peripheral neuropathy, reflexes, tetany, mental status, handgrip strength</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin: Ecchymoses, petechiae, pallor, pressure ulcers, assessment of surgical wound healing and signs of surgical site infection (if postoperative).</p><p/><p>Signs of specific nutritional deficiencies should also be sought. Some of these are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78426 \">table 1</a>). Appropriate micronutrient levels should be investigated depending on clinical exam findings. (See <a href=\"#H8899847\" class=\"local\">'Other laboratory studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Several clinical tools are available to quickly assess and score nutrition status. The Subjective Global Assessment of Nutritional Status is a brief tool that includes history and physical examination findings, and allows standardized assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The Nutritional Risk Screening tool (NRS 2002) can be applied rapidly and used to screen for poor baseline nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A study that assessed the ability of the NRS 2002 score to predict the incidence and severity of postoperative complications found the overall incidence of nutritional risk was 14 percent among 608 patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A significantly higher overall complication rate was found in patients at nutritional risk compared with those with a normal NRS 2002 risk score (40 versus 15 percent). Severe complications were also significantly higher in patients at nutritional risk (54 versus 15 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing protein status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessing protein status is particularly important in the surgical patient because of the close relationship between protein status and wound healing, and because protein-calorie malnutrition can be treated with supplementation as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Protein status is affected by previous intake, muscle mass, duration of current illness, blood loss, wound healing, infections, and gastrointestinal absorption.</p><p>Three serum measures of protein status have differing half-lives. These serum components do not directly indicate nutritional status, but rather reflect the severity of illness and must be used in conjunction with other clinical data such as the duration of the current surgical illness to be useful in determining therapy. Although decreased levels for these protein markers correlate with adverse outcomes, improvements in these markers with nutritional supplementation are not reliably associated with a clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes for nutritional intervention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum albumin has the longest half-life at 18 to 20 days and is the most extensively used parameter. Low serum albumin (&lt;2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> is a marker of a negative catabolic state, and a predictor of poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Surgical stress, other acute stresses, hepatic disease, and renal disease decrease serum albumin levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum transferrin has an intermediate half-life of eight to nine days, reflecting protein status over the past two to four weeks. Transferrin also reflects iron status, and low transferrin should be considered an indicator of protein status only in the setting of normal serum iron.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum prealbumin (transthyretin) has the shortest half-life at two to three days. Although prealbumin responds quickly to the onset of malnutrition and rises rapidly with adequate protein intake, the level can be altered in the acute phase response due to acute or chronic inflammation. In general, inflammatory cytokines reduce the level of prealbumin synthesis by the liver, and it can also be reduced with renal and hepatic disease. Therefore, serum prealbumin is the least helpful of the three for assessing overall nutritional status.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8899847\"><span class=\"h2\">Other laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to assessing protein status, a few other laboratory studies may be helpful. Electrolytes, glucose, and <span class=\"nowrap\">BUN/creatinine</span> help assess overall clinical and fluid volume status and need to be obtained if parenteral (intravenous) nutrition will be instituted. Iron levels should be measured in the setting of unexplained anemia, as should specific vitamin levels if clinically indicated (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">B12/folate</span> in macrocytic anemias, others based upon specific physical signs). Serum calcium, magnesium, and phosphorous should also be assessed periodically, particularly in the setting of poor oral intake or diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the presence of malnutrition is established, or it becomes clear that the patient will not be able to maintain adequate nutrition, nutritional intervention may include oral supplementation, enteral (tube) feeding, or parenteral (intravenous) feeding. Enteral support is recommended over parenteral support because of its relative simplicity, safety, reduced complications, and lower cost, as well as its ability to maintain mucosal barrier function. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4249205021\"><span class=\"h2\">Enteral nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteral nutrition support refers to the provision of calories, protein, electrolytes, vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and fluids via an intestinal route, either orally or via a feeding tube. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral supplementation &ndash; There is a wide variety of supplements available for oral supplementation in a wide range of styles (juice, yogurt, milk shakes), formats (liquid, powder, pudding, pre-thickened), types (high protein, fiber-containing, low volume), energy densities (1 to 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">Kcal/mL),</span> and flavors. Most oral supplements provide 300 Kcal, 12 g protein, and a full range of vitamins and minerals. Specific types of oral supplements may benefit certain groups. In general, high protein oral supplements are most suitable for patients with wounds, and those with malignancy. Prethickened supplements and puddings are helpful for providing nutritional support to individuals with dysphagia and those with neurological conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tube feeding &ndash; Enteral nutrition may be delivered in a gastric or postpyloric fashion. The available formulations, components, and delivery of enteral nutrition are reviewed elsewhere.

Many enteral and parenteral formulas contain nutrients previously considered nonessential, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a>, glutamine, RNA nucleotides, and omega-3 fatty acids. During an episode of critical illness, these nutrients may become &quot;conditionally essential.&quot; Formulas that are supplemented with these components are often referred to as immune-enhancing nutritional supplements, or simply immunonutrition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Immune-enhancing nutritional supplements'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466002282\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general indications for nutritional support include preexisting nutritional deprivation, anticipated or actual inadequate energy intake by mouth, and significant multiorgan system disease. Among patients undergoing surgery, patients who undergo gastrointestinal surgery may be at a greater nutritional disadvantage if the return of intestinal function is significantly delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/24-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-30</a>]. </p><p>Early enteral feeding (oral, tube feeding) can be instituted following many types of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. A Cochrane review and meta-analysis updated in 2011 identified no obvious advantage to the routine practice of maintaining patients &quot;nil per os&quot; (ie, NPO) postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8899572\" class=\"local\">'Early enteral feeding'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients, such as those with inflammatory bowel disease, have an increased risk of being malnourished when undergoing surgical procedures. A period of bowel rest (nil per os) may be appropriate for patients with disease that is severe enough to require surgical intervention.

Earlier enteral support may be appropriate in patients who are malnourished at baseline, or who have a complicated postoperative course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/23,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,35</a>]. In patients undergoing bowel surgery for gastrointestinal malignancy, malignancy-related metabolic changes may also suggest the need for earlier intervention.

The risks associated with each route of nutritional support, plus the added cost, need to be taken into account, along with the potential benefits, when assessing the need for perioperative nutritional support. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466002179\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative nutritional support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe malnutrition may derive some benefit from delaying surgery to be fed, but are at an increased risk for infectious complications if treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>.

Overall, patients who received parenteral nutrition had a higher rate of infectious complications (14.1 versus 6.4 percent), but mortality rates were not significantly different (7.3 and 4.9 percent at 30 days).

Enteral nutrition (oral or tube feeds) rather than parenteral nutrition should be instituted whenever possible. For patients with a delayed return of intestinal function, postoperative parenteral nutrition is indicated only if return of bowel function is not anticipated for more than 10 days. Earlier intervention may be appropriate in patients who are severely malnourished at baseline, or who have a complicated postoperative course.

Early nutrition is a component of most enhanced recovery after surgery protocols (ERAS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis evaluated 44 randomized trials of perioperative enteral nutrition (predominantly postoperative support) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Trials were grouped into three comparisons: enteral nutrition versus no artificial nutrition, enteral nutrition versus parenteral nutrition, and volitional nutritional supplements (oral supplemental feeding) versus no artificial nutrition. There were no mortality differences for any of the comparator groups. Compared with no artificial nutrition, patients receiving enteral nutrition had fewer infections (absolute risk -11 percent, 95% CI -20 to -1 percent), but there was no significant impact on duration of hospitalization or the incidence of wound complications. Patients who received postoperative oral nutritional supplements, compared with no supplements, also had a decreased infection rate (absolute risk difference -10 percent 95% CI -19 to -1), and a shorter length of hospital stay by two days (95% CI -3.37 to -0.72). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another meta-analysis comparing enteral nutrition within 24 hours of gastrointestinal surgery with traditional postoperative management showed a 45 percent decrease in the risk of overall postoperative complications in those patients receiving early postoperative feeding. There were no differences in the incidence of anastomotic dehiscence, length of stay, or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By comparison, a Cochrane review and meta-analysis updated in 2011 identified 14 trials that included 1224 patients undergoing predominantly colorectal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. No significant differences were identified in the risk of intra-abdominal abscess, anastomotic <span class=\"nowrap\">leak/dehiscence,</span> or pneumonia for patients started on early oral nutrition (initiated within 24 hours of surgery) compared with traditional surgical care (ie, no nutrition or oral nutrition when tolerated). Length of hospital stay and the incidence of postoperative wound infection were also similar. A meta-analysis of six of the trials found a slightly increased risk of vomiting (risk ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.61). The higher incidence of vomiting reported in the early feeding group did not appear to be related to oral intake compared with tube feeding. No additional information was given regarding the type of surgery (open versus laparoscopic) or perioperative pain management (eg, opioid or antiemetic use). A later systematic review and meta-analysis that focused on colorectal surgery found similar results; there was a reduced length of hospital stay but no significant difference in the rate of vomiting between those who received early oral feeding compared with those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p/><p>Whether the route of enteral administration has any clinically important effect for surgeries other than colorectal surgery, which is the basis for much of the literature on postoperative nutrition, may be less certain. As an example, for pancreaticoduodenectomy, a systematic review of early enteral nutrition did not shown any differences in complication rates for five differing routes of administration, including an oral route; enteral nutrition via either a nasojejunal tube, gastrostomy, or jejunostomy; or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (seven randomized trials, seven observational studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. A later trial that randomly assigned 59 patients to a nasoenteric tube or jejunostomy tube following pancreaticoduodenectomy also found no significant difference in complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, the nasoenteral group required introduction of parenteral therapy significantly more frequently than the jejunostomy group. In a trial comparing early nasojejunal tube feedings with early parenteral nutritional support, the overall incidence of complications was higher for nasojejunal feedings (76 versus 64 percent) due to a higher incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula and delay in resumption of oral diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. There were no significant differences in the incidence of infectious complications or length of postoperative stay.

Several meta-analyses have evaluated immunonutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/36,54-57,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,54-57,70,71</a>]. Reductions in infectious complications and length of hospital stay have been found, but without an effect on mortality (48 trials). In a large review and meta-analysis of immunonutrition (including trials of glutamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a>, omega-3 fatty acids, RNA, and nucleotides), there was no effect on perioperative mortality associated with major abdominal surgery. Compared with control groups, immunonutrition reduced the risk of overall complications (odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94, 41 trials) and infectious complications (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.51-0.66, 66 trials), and shortened hospital stay (mean difference -1.79 days, 95% CI -2.39 to -1.19, 52 trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. However, when including three trials judged by the authors to have a high or unclear risk of bias, these effects were no longer seen. The authors of these meta-analyses have noted methodological flaws in the individual studies. It is worth noting that surgical patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications have been excluded from the majority of studies on immunonutrition. Thus, until higher-quality data demonstrating unequivocal benefit are available, immunonutrition cannot be recommended as a routine addition to nutritional supplementation in surgical patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3943473083\"><span class=\"h2\">Probiotics/synbiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to supplementation of calories or using immune-enhancing treatments, it has been speculated that probiotics or synbiotics administered in the perioperative period may improve surgical outcomes. Probiotics are living microorganisms believed to convey health benefits to the host. Synbiotics are nutritional supplementations combining probiotics with prebiotics, which are ingredients that stimulate the growth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of beneficial intestinal microorganisms. Probiotics or synbiotics can be administered preoperatively, postoperatively, or both, and via oral or enteral routes. </p><p>Whether perioperative administration of <span class=\"nowrap\">probiotics/synbiotics</span> improves outcomes of abdominal surgery is unclear.&nbsp;Routine use of <span class=\"nowrap\">probiotics/synbiotics</span> has not been uniformly adopted by the surgical community or within enhanced recovery protocols, but several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have suggested a variety of possible benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/72-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-76</a>]. The latest of these was a systematic review that identified 34 trials in patients who predominantly underwent gastrointestinal or other abdominal (eg, pancreatic) surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Among 20 trials, patients who received perioperative <span class=\"nowrap\">pro-/synbiotics</span> (n = 825) had a significantly lower risk of surgical site infection compared with those who received valid control treatment (n = 424; relative risk [RR] 0.65; 95% CI 0.51-0.84).
