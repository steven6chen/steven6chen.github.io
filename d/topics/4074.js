Despite this decrease, it remains one of the leading causes of opportunistic infections among HIV-infected persons with low CD4 cell counts, such as those who are unaware of their HIV diagnoses or are not receiving medical care.</p><p>The general features of <em>Pneumocystis</em> pulmonary infection in the HIV-infected patient, including clinical presentation and diagnosis, will be reviewed here. An overview of extrapulmonary disease due to pneumocystic infection will also be discussed. Treatment and prophylaxis of <em>Pneumocystis</em> infection in HIV-infected and non-infected individuals are considered elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis infection in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1429656\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Pneumocystis</em> is currently recognized as a fungus based upon ribosomal RNA and other gene sequence homologies, the composition of their cell walls, and the structure of key enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Prior to being identified as a fungus, the taxonomic classification of <em>Pneumocystis</em> as a genus of protozoan organisms had been questioned for several years. However, <em>Pneumocystis</em> organisms are atypical fungi as they do not grow in fungal culture, they respond to some antiparasitic agents, and they have a cell wall that contains cholesterol rather than ergosterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The life cycle consists of the trophic form, a precystic form, and the cystic form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The trophic form predominates over the cystic form during infection. </p><p>The nomenclature for Pneumocystis has also changed; the species that infects rats is called <em>P. carinii</em>; and the one that infects humans, <em>P. jirovecii </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. <em>P. jirovecii</em> is now designated as the species name to use in publications and references to human infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, the abbreviation of &quot;PCP&quot; is still used to refer to the clinical entity of &quot;<em>Pneumocystis</em> Pneumonia&quot;; this allows for the retention of the familiar acronym and maintains the accuracy of this abbreviation in older published papers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200901706\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200901900\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary mode of transmission of <em>P. jirovecii</em> is via the airborne route. Serologic studies show that primary infection occurs early in life, with 75 percent of humans infected by the age of four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It was initially believed that PCP remained in a latent state unless the patient became immunosuppressed; however, this may not account for all cases of PCP. Animal and human studies have shown clearance of the organism, and there is increasing evidence of transmission from person to person and possibly through environmental reservoirs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. The role of colonization in humans may also be of importance to <em>Pneumocystis</em> transmission. (See <a href=\"#H4152697742\" class=\"local\">'Colonization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2795768\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogen-host interaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Pneumocystis</em> exists almost exclusively within the alveoli of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The trophic forms first attach to the epithelium. Interaction of <em>Pneumocystis</em> with alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages initiates a cascade of cellular responses in both the organism and lung cells. Attachment of <em>Pneumocystis</em> to lung epithelial cells enhances <em>Pneumocystis</em> proliferation.</p><p>Alveolar macrophages are the primary resident phagocytes that mediate the clearance of the organisms from the lung. Phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and inflammatory activation of alveolar macrophages in response to <em>Pneumocystis </em>are impaired in HIV-infected persons, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of infection. Accumulating evidence indicates that beta-glucan molecules, which are abundant in the cell wall of <em>Pneumocystis</em> are important components that drive the initiation of the inflammatory response during PCP. The most abundant surface protein of <em>Pneumocystis </em>is the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Variation of the expressed MSG may facilitate evasion of host immune responses. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20326168\"><span class=\"h2\">Host immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune control of <em>Pneumocystis</em> involves production of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines by alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. In healthy individuals, CD4+ T cells coordinate the host inflammatory response by recruiting and activating additional immune effector cells including monocytes and macrophages, which are responsible for elimination of the organism. In contrast to CD4+ T cells, the role of CD8+ T cells in host defense against <em>Pneumocystis</em> is more controversial. However, CD8+ T cells may have some beneficial effect, particularly in a situation of chronic CD4+ depletion. In mice, the T-cell mediated inflammatory response can cause impaired lung compliance and gas exchange; as such, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may result in deleterious lung inflammation. In addition to T cells, neutrophils, recruited by CXCL2 and IL-8, also participate in lung inflammation during PCP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4152697742\"><span class=\"h2\">Colonization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Healthy individuals, as well as those with HIV infection, underlying lung disease, and immunosuppression, may harbor <em>Pneumocystis</em> in their respiratory tract despite being without any signs or symptoms of disease. These colonized individuals have generally been identified using experimental polymerase chain reaction assays. (See <a href=\"#H598864612\" class=\"local\">'Identifying the organism'</a> below.)</p><p>The prevalence of <em>Pneumocystis</em> colonization among healthy adults ranges from 0 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and it has also been demonstrated to be a common colonizer in hospitalized patients with bacterial and viral pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The clinical significance of colonization is not well understood, but may be important for several reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonized individuals may be at risk of developing pneumonia or transmitting infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonized individuals receiving <em>Pneumocystis</em> prophylaxis may be at risk for developing drug resistance mutations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ongoing colonization may trigger inflammation and local alveolar damage leading to lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24110398\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of PCP has dramatically decreased after the administration of potent ART, and the general adoption of recommendations for PCP prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15-19</a>].

Immunofluorescent staining using fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies represents the preferred technique for the diagnosis of PCP and is more sensitive than the general stains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2,24,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24,29</a>].</p><p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of respiratory fluid, in particular bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), is increasingly used to make the diagnosis of PCP in HIV-uninfected patients who are immunocompromised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].&nbsp;Experience in patients with HIV is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/29,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,49,50</a>], although several clinical laboratories offer the test. Advantages to PCR testing include confirming the diagnosis in clinically suspect cases with negative sputum or BAL smears, and using alternative specimens such as oral washes and nasopharyngeal aspirates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

The type of specimen that should be obtained depends on the respiratory status of the patient, concern for alternative pathogens, the institution where the specimen is being processed, and the risks of the various procedures. In most cases, sputum induction is the initial step in the attempt to obtain an adequate specimen. In many cases, however, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are required to make the diagnosis of PCP. The ability to detect <em>Pneumocystis</em> can be reduced in patients receiving prophylactic therapy, particularly those receiving aerosolized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/38,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,52</a>].</p><p>Infrequently, a more invasive technique, such as a lung biopsy, is necessary. However, most patients are treated empirically without resorting to these more invasive methods because of the significant morbidity associated with their use.

While the specificity of this method can approach 100 percent, the sensitivity is highly variable, ranging from 55 to approximately 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. Factors that affect the accuracy of sputum induction include the type of staining that is used, the quality of the specimen, the burden of organisms (particularly in the setting of prophylactic therapy), and the expertise of the laboratory in interpreting the specimen. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H118237500\"><span class=\"h4\">Bronchoalveolar lavage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In HIV infected individuals, BAL is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of PCP. Therefore, if sputum induction is nondiagnostic or cannot be performed (eg, the patient cannot cooperate, is too dyspneic, or is unable to produce a specimen), fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL is the next recommended step. </p><p>BAL alone has a diagnostic yield of 90 to 100 percent in HIV-infected patients. To increase its sensitivity, site-directed lavage can be used in patients with focal infiltrates; this involves sampling the most heavily involved lobes on chest radiograph. One group has shown that the combination of site-directed lavage and immunofluorescent antibody staining increased the sensitivity of BAL from 80 to 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Transbronchial biopsy, which has a diagnostic yield of up to 100 percent, can be added if necessary. </p><p>The major concerns with using BAL are the potential risks of the procedure.

Options include transthoracic needle biopsy or lung biopsy performed either via thoracotomy or by video-associated thoracoscopic surgery. However, the risks with these procedures, which are significant, must be weighed against the need for an accurate and definitive diagnosis: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transthoracic needle biopsy, which has a high diagnostic yield, is associated with a 30 percent incidence of pneumothorax. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung biopsy, either by thoracotomy or by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, can be performed with a sensitivity of 95 to 100 percent for the diagnosis of PCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Histology on lung biopsy demonstrates the formation of a foamy, eosinophilic alveolar exudate; severe cases are associated with edema and interstitial fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H269639537\"><span class=\"h4\">Endotracheal aspirates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endotracheal aspirates from intubated and mechanically ventilated patients have a high sensitivity for the detection of PCP. As an example, one study of 31 intubated patients found that endotracheal aspirates examined with immunostaining techniques had a sensitivity of 92 percent for PCP, with immunostained BAL specimens serving as the reference standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Increasingly, elevated levels of 1-3-beta-d-glucan are used to help support this diagnosis. Thus, some clinicians may choose to forego obtaining a definitive diagnosis if beta glucan levels are markedly elevated and the clinical presentation and radiographic findings are highly consistent with PCP. Others, however, recommend obtaining a definitive diagnosis if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Support for the diagnostic utility of 1-3-beta-d-glucan levels is provided by a study of 282 HIV-infected patients in which levels greater than 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> were associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 92 and 65 percent for the diagnosis of PCP, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

These diseases may present with atypical signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms in patients with advanced immunosuppression and the clinician must be diligent in ensuring that they are not responsible for the underlying clinical presentation. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the HIV-infected patient with pulmonary symptoms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pulmonary infections with specific organisms are a significant concern in HIV infected patients with CD4 counts less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. These include tuberculosis, nontuberculosis mycobacteria, several different fungi, toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus, and influenza.

As immunity declines, the frequency of pulmonary cavitation, which is the hallmark of pulmonary TB in adults, becomes progressively less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. In HIV-infected individuals with advanced immunosuppression, the findings on chest radiographs can vary, ranging from no evidence of disease to a miliary pattern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Compared with PCP, tuberculosis is associated with more severe constitutional symptoms. The incidence of TB in HIV-infected individuals varies markedly depending on epidemiology. Most cases in the United States now occur in individuals originally from countries where TB is highly endemic, or in those with risk factors for exposure (eg, prisoners, injection drug users, household contacts of active TB cases). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91235421\"><span class=\"h2\">Nontuberculous mycobacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) that can cause disease in patients with HIV, especially in those with CD4 cell counts less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. Most disease in HIV secondary to NTM presents as disseminated disease, without respiratory symptoms or pulmonary involvement; this is particularly the case for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). This manifestation of MAC is far different from the multifocal nodular disease (with &quot;tree in bud&quot; radiographic opacities) seen in immunocompetent hosts, such as those with bronchiectasis. However, on rare occasions disease due to M. kansasii and M. xenopi can present with localized pulmonary findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1389459\"><span class=\"h2\">Fungi</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV-infected patients who are from regions known to have endemic fungal infections can present with disseminated diseases that may mimic PCP. The most important of these is disseminated histoplasmosis. Both diagnoses should be considered in a patient with fever, cough, and diffuse interstitial infiltrates who is from a histoplasmosis-endemic area. Elevated beta-glucan levels are observed in both PCP and histoplasmosis. Findings suggestive of histoplasmosis include adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of oral or other mucosal ulcerations.
