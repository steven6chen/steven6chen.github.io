Cardiac patients are often fearful of triggering myocardial infarction (MI) during intercourse and may therefore have sex less frequently. Another component of this problem is that patients seeking medical attention for sexual dysfunction often have concomitant cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><p>Several aspects of the sex-MI relationship will be discussed here, including the cardiovascular effects of sexual activity, the association between sex and MI, modulating factors that may decrease the risk of MI following sexual activity, and the treatment options for cardiac patients with sexual dysfunction. The risk in patients with other CVDs will also be mentioned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual activity, including arousal, erection, ejaculation, orgasm, refractory period, and resolution, is in part dependent upon changes in the autonomic nervous system.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual arousal and penile erection in men results from stimulation of parasympathetic nerves in the penis, reduced activity of sympathetic pathways, and the release of nitric oxide from the endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The importance of nitric oxide constitutes the rationale for the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> in men with sexual dysfunction.

The mean heart rate at the time of orgasm was 117 beats per minute, which was lower than the heart rate during normal daily activities (mean 120 beats per minute). Although the blood pressure was not measured in these studies, the mean estimated blood pressure was <span class=\"nowrap\">162/89</span> mmHg. This value was based upon the blood pressure achieved during exercise to a heart rate similar to that during orgasm. Although such a calculation might underestimate the peak blood pressure at the time of orgasm, because it does not account for the sympathetic response to arousal and intercourse, similar values were noted in another study in which the blood pressure was measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The standard clinical measure of exertion is the metabolic equivalent (MET) of oxygen consumption; 1 MET is defined as 3.5 mL O<sub>2</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">uptake/kg</span> per minute, which is the resting oxygen uptake in a sitting position. Sexual activity is often equated with 2 to 3 METS during the preorgasmic phase and 3 to 4 METS during orgasm; this is equivalent to walking at two to four miles per hour on a level surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Exercise testing is often used to assess both exercise tolerance and tolerance for sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The clinical implication of these observations is that sexual intercourse is associated with a modest increase in myocardial oxygen demand that lasts only a brief time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This has been confirmed in a number of studies that found that sexual activity contributes to only a small percent of infarctions.</p><p>Other reports have evaluated the effect of exercise training and sexual position on the cardiovascular response to sexual activity. Exercise training attenuates the heart rate response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and reduces the small risk of myocardial infarction (MI) following sex&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Regular exercise'</a> below). In one report, 16 patients with MI underwent a 16-week exercise training program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The mean peak heart rate during orgasm was significantly lower after exercise training (120 versus 127 beats per minute prior to training) and maximal oxygen consumption increased by 11.5 percent. There was no change in heart rate or oxygen consumption in six control patients.</p><p>It has been assumed that the man would perform less physical work during sexual intercourse if he were supine. However, this does not appear to be important. In one study of eight normal men who were monitored during sexual intercourse with their wives in their bedrooms, there was no difference in heart rate (114 versus 117 beats per minute) or blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">(163/81</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">161/77</span> mmHg) between man on top or man on bottom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A second study found a slightly lower minute oxygen consumption for men in the supine position, but this lasted for only a brief period during orgasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Response in stable angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During sexual intercourse, the increase in heart rate and blood pressure is the same as any form of exercise. Thus, patients with angina may become symptomatic during intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. In one series of 35 such patients who were monitored during intercourse in their homes, 65 percent complained of angina on at least some occasions and had to stop activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Appropriate medical therapy, usually beta blockers and, in some cases, prophylactic sublingual nitrates, can prevent angina in these patients and permit a normal sex life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients with chronic coronary disease who undergo revascularization with a percutaneous coronary intervention or bypass surgery and who are asymptomatic do not have an increased risk of symptoms during sexual intercourse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF MI AFTER SEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to determine the relative risk of myocardial infarction (MI) following sex, a case-crossover design has been used. With this method, each patient serves as his or her own control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As a result, the effect of confounding chronic risk factors is virtually eliminated, which is important because people who are sexually active may be different from those who are not sexually active in ways that would be difficult to account for if different individuals were selected for the control group.</p><p>The case-crossover design was used in the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study of 1774 patients who were interviewed within one week of an acute MI; 858 patients were sexually active [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative risk of MI within two hours after sexual activity was 2.5; there was no increased risk of MI beyond this time period. The risk was reduced in patients who underwent regular exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative risk of MI after sexual activity was similar in patients with a history of prior angina or MI or no prior cardiac disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only 9 percent of patients had sex in the 24 hours before MI and only 3 percent in the important two-hour time period. As a result, the absolute increase in risk was small, as sexual activity appeared to contribute to the onset of MI in only 0.9 percent of patients. Many other triggers of an MI, such as psychologic stress, anger, or physical activity, may cause a greater increase in absolute risk because they occur more frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>The results were similar in a second case-crossover study of 699 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Only 1.3 percent had sexual intercourse within two hours of an MI; the estimated relative risk of an MI in the hour after sexual intercourse was 2.1 overall and 4.4 in those with a sedentary lifestyle.</p><p>Although sexual activity can trigger an MI, what is important to the individual is the absolute increase in risk (ie, the risk from sex minus the risk at all other times, referred to as the &quot;attributable risk&quot;). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glossary-of-common-biostatistical-and-epidemiological-terms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since sexual activity is a transient trigger that increases risk for only a two-hour period, the absolute increase in risk is very small. Based upon the result from the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], a 50-year-old man free of cardiac disease with an annual baseline risk of MI of 1 percent would increase his annual risk of MI to only 1.01 percent from weekly sexual activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Even a person with a high annual risk for an MI of 10 percent would increase the annual risk to only 10.1 percent from weekly sexual activity.</p><p>Recognizing the difficulty for studying this phenomenon, investigators communicated a very low incidence (0.7 percent) of recent sexual activity observed in a cohort of 576 patients with coronary heart disease and incident MI. In this same report, there was also no association noted in frequency of sexual activity and MI incidence in this cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Modulation of risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two factors appear to modulate the risk of MI after intercourse: exercise and medical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Regular exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In both of the case-crossover studies described above, the risk of MI following sexual activity was reduced in patients who exercised regularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In an analysis from the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, regular physical exercise at levels of &ge;6 metabolic equivalents (METs) modified the association between sex and MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The more regularly a person exercised, the lower their relative risk of MI from sexual activity.</p><p>These findings are consistent with observations that regular exercise reduces the risk of triggering MI and sudden death from heavy physical exertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>] and that exercise training increases the aerobic capacity and decreases the peak heart rate in post-MI subjects engaging in sexual intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In another analysis from the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, 4.4 percent of patients with an acute MI reported heavy physical exertion within one hour of the MI, with symptoms usually beginning during exertion (relative risk 5.9 compared with less strenuous or no physical exercise) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Importantly, the relative risk was inversely related to the degree of regular exercise before the MI, ranging from 2.4 to 107 in patients who usually exercised five or more times per week or less than once per week, respectively. Thus, people who have been physically and sexually inactive may require more careful medical advice and monitoring prior to resuming sexual activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other potential modifiers of risk may be hypothesized from studies of patients with an MI and the proposed pathophysiology of triggering factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The increased relative risk of MI from sexual activity makes it similar to other triggers of MI. Among the proposed triggers are enhanced hemodynamic stress, resulting from an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen demand, as well as increased platelet aggregability and coagulation in combination with a coronary artery plaque that is vulnerable to rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-activity-in-patients-with-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, the absolute increase in risk is very small. In addition, risk modification can be accomplished with regular physical activity and possibly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and beta blocker use. Thus, patients with heart disease who are not deemed to be at high risk should be able to be sexually active after appropriate risk stratification and optimization of therapy and can be safely treated for sexual dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Sexual activity risk assignment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both the Second Princeton Consensus Panel and a consensus statement from the American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association concluded that a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor is safe for men with stable coronary artery disease who are not taking nitrates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no clinical differences among the PDE-5 inhibitors with the exception of a prolonged duration of action with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tadalafil</a>. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vardenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vardenafil</a> and tadalafil are not likely to be associated with increased cardiac risk compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a>, there is less clinical information related to the safety of these drugs in men with heart disease. Until such information is available, and because of its relatively shorter half-life, we recommend sildenafil for men with erectile dysfunction who have heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PDE-5 inhibitors are <strong>contraindicated</strong> with any nitrate preparation and should not be taken with alpha-blocking agents. Cardiac patients should be counseled about the interaction with nitrates, even if a PDE-5 inhibitor is not currently prescribed. If a man who has taken a PDE-5 inhibitor develops chest pain, nitrates should not be administered within 24 hours (or longer in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a>, 24 hours of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vardenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vardenafil</a>, or up to 48 hours of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tadalafil</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association consensus statement also alerts clinicians to the potentially hazardous cardiovascular effects of PDE-5 inhibitors in the following groups of patients:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with active coronary ischemia, even in those who are not taking nitrates (eg, positive exercise stress test for ischemia).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with heart failure and borderline low blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low volume status.
