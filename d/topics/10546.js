Many aspects of the treatment of stage III disease are controversial. Unfortunately, the data supporting treatment approaches in specific patient subsets are often subject to a number of limitations, for example that the trials involved heterogeneous patient populations; the definition of stage III disease has changed over time; and early studies were frequently inadequately powered to detect small differences in therapeutic outcome, were not randomized, or had limited duration of follow-up. Major improvements in therapy, including the use of more active chemotherapy agents and refinements in radiation and surgical techniques, also limit the interpretation of earlier clinical trials. Finally, improvements in pretreatment staging have led to reclassification of patients with relatively minimal metastatic disease as stage IV rather than stage III, leading to a prolonging in the apparent overall survival of both stage III and IV patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Taking these study limitations into consideration, the treatment approach for stage III disease presented here is consistent with guidelines from the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], which have been endorsed by American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The initial approach to staging of NSCLC and its implications for prognosis are discussed separately.

For the purposes of this topic, stage III disease refers to the eighth edition TNM staging system, which went into effect January 1, 2018. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Eighth edition of the TNM system'</a>.)</p><p>Historically, stage III lung cancer was defined as locoregionally advanced disease due to primary tumor extension into extrapulmonary structures (T3 or T4) or mediastinal lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) without evidence of distant metastases (M0). In the eighth edition of the TNM staging system, stage III lung cancers also include tumors greater than 5 cm in size with hilar, intrapulmonary, or peribronchial lymph node involvement (T3N1) or tumors greater than 7 cm (T4), regardless of lymph node involvement. In the previous (seventh) edition, T3N1 tumors were also considered stage III, but the lower size cutoff was 7 cm, not 5 cm, and tumors greater than 7 cm without lymph node involvement were considered stage IIB disease. While there were no differences in the N descriptors between the seventh and eighth editions of the TNM staging system, a new category stage IIIC was developed for those with <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/T4,</span> N3 disease, while those with such tumors that have mediastinal involvement are now staged as IIIB rather than IIIA.

Absence of tumor involvement of the mediastinal lymph nodes remains one of the most important factors in selecting patients for surgical intervention. Options for evaluation include mediastinoscopy and endoscopic bronchial ultrasound. Choice of procedure to obtain biopsy is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-evaluation-of-mediastinal-lymphadenopathy#H548647104\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy&quot;, section on 'Selection of biopsy procedure'</a>.)</p><p>Pathologic confirmation of tumor involvement of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (based upon computed tomography [CT] criteria) or metabolically active nodes (by positron emission tomography [PET] criteria) is recommended in patients who are otherwise potentially resectable. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If mediastinal lymph nodes are negative by pathologic evaluation, then resection of the primary tumor along with further mediastinal lymph node assessment at surgery is in order, similar to stage I and stage II disease.

(See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'N2 disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For patients without suggestion of N2-3 lymph node involvement by both CT and PET criteria, the role of cytologic or pathologic evaluation of the mediastinal lymph nodes is more involved:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive mediastinal staging is indicated for all patients with central tumors; those with potentially resectable T2, T3, and T4 tumors; and those with tumors with enlarged hilar lymph nodes by CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical N1 involvement by PET, even if the mediastinum appears clean by both CT and PET criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of preoperative pathologic evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes for patients with a peripheral T1a primary lesion and no suggestion of N1 or N2-3 lymph node involvement by both CT and PET criteria is controversial: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some centers proceed directly to primary resection without preoperative pathologic evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes in view of the relatively low incidence of involved mediastinal nodes identified at mediastinoscopy in this selected population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By contrast, other centers advocate offering preoperative pathologic evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes because of the impact on management strategy when occult lymph node metastases are detected. As an example, in one study 6.5 percent of patients with T1 primary lesions had occult N2 disease despite a negative CT and PET of the mediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">NO KNOWN MEDIASTINAL INVOLVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection is a key component of the treatment of patients with stage III N0 or N1 NSCLC if a complete resection is technically feasible and the patient&rsquo;s overall condition is satisfactory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Surgery is also used in patients with clinical stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> disease who ultimately are found to have pathologic stage III disease at resection (particularly if a thorough pre-resection mediastinal nodal evaluation had been negative).</p><p>Definitive radiation therapy (RT) may be an alternative for patients who technically are resectable but are not surgical candidates for other reasons.

When tumors of this size are associated with N1 involvement, they are considered stage IIIA. The appropriate initial management of these patients involves surgical resection if technically feasible after negative invasive mediastinal staging, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for those with completely resected disease. If a complete resection is not technically feasible, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H745843947\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant systemic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11659058\" class=\"local\">'Choice of chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11658993\" class=\"local\">'Administration of radiation'</a> below.)</p><p>An exception to this approach is made for patients with a superior sulcus (Pancoast) tumor with hilar lymph node involvement or no lymph node involvement, which is generally treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. The management of Pancoast tumors is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Superior pulmonary sulcus (Pancoast) tumors&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiple tumor nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the eighth edition TNM staging system (as well as in the preceding staging system), discrete tumors in the same lobe as the primary are classified as T3, while nodules in another ipsilateral lobe are considered T4. Nodules in the contralateral lung are classified as M1a.</p><p>Patients with satellite nodules within the same lobe as the primary tumor are candidates for surgery as their initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Patients with ipsilateral nodules in another lobe and negative mediastinal nodes may also be candidates for surgical resection, depending on the location and extent of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,14</a>]. Adjuvant chemotherapy is often recommended in this setting, but data are limited for this patient subset. (See <a href=\"#H745843947\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Although patients with solitary tumor nodules in each lung are considered stage IV, many of these patients actually have synchronous primaries and may have a favorable outcome if treated aggressively. A reasonable approach is full radiographic staging, combined with mediastinoscopy. If that evaluation is negative, a presumption of synchronous unrelated cancers and treatment as such is reasonable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-primary-lung-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple primary lung cancers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522757065\"><span class=\"h3\">T4N0-1 disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, T4 lesions were considered unresectable by definition and were classified as stage IIIB. Even with improvement in surgical techniques, resectable T4N0-1 lesions are uncommon and most T4 lesions are best treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy, as for patients with mediastinal involvement. (See <a href=\"#H11659058\" class=\"local\">'Choice of chemotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11658993\" class=\"local\">'Administration of radiation'</a> below.)</p><p>A small subset of patients may be surgical candidates, but appropriate patient selection is of critical importance. Surgery for T4 disease is contraindicated in the presence of N2 involvement (stage IIIB) or if an incomplete resection is inevitable. The role for surgery in this patient group is not supported by firm evidence, but given the rarity of these tumors, it is unlikely that randomized data will ever be available. Considerations should include the operative morbidity and the experience at the given center. Preoperative induction chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy may be of value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

For patients with mediastinal lymph node involvement in a resection specimen, adjuvant chemotherapy can result in a significant survival benefit. Postoperative RT may also have a role for these patients and for those with positive surgical margins. (See <a href=\"#H745843947\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1387149942\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H745843947\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence from clinical trials indicates that adjuvant chemotherapy using contemporary platinum-based doublet regimens prolongs overall survival in patients with completely resected stage III disease. Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is now considered the standard of care for patients with completely resected stage II and III NSCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Data regarding the efficacy of adjuvant systemic therapy in stage III NSCLC are found elsewhere.

For those with or without driver mutations, the use of adjuvant targeted therapy including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crizotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">crizotinib</a> is under evaluation in randomized clinical trials, but available results have not suggested a survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Immunotherapy agents are also being evaluated on trial in these patients, for example <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02595944&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPMKBU4wiTQGKvJQc40BcnrtVVUAa1Ag0QmkTj1KR6qWxQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4623\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02595944</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340526660\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant postoperative RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although survival is often limited by the development of distant metastatic disease, postoperative RT may prevent locoregional recurrence and improve survival in carefully selected patients. We use adjuvant radiation for patients with positive surgical margins, those with inadequate lymph node sampling in whom mediastinal node involvement was suspected, and those who are found at surgery to have involved N2 lymph nodes. Although some UpToDate experts typically use adjuvant postoperative RT for single or multiple involved N2 nodes, this is in the setting of limited data. Other UpToDate experts may omit postoperative RT for select cases of single-station N2 disease, in order to avoid excess toxicity (eg, if only one of many N2 nodes resected was positive).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positive surgical margins &ndash;</strong> The strongest data supporting adjuvant RT for positive surgical margins come from a National Cancer Database study of 3395 patients who underwent a resection with positive surgical margins for stage II or III NSCLC between 2005 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Of these, 1207 received postoperative RT to a total dose from 50 to 74 Gy using contemporary RT techniques. Overall survival was longer for those given postoperative RT (median, 33.5 versus 23.7 months without RT; five-year survival rates, 32.4 versus 23.7 percent). On multivariable analysis, this difference was statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92). On subset analysis, a similar improvement in overall survival was seen with postoperative RT regardless of whether patients had N0, N1, or N2 disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of radiation in treating patients with carcinoma in situ only at the surgical margin is uncertain. It is often recommended, given the improved prognosis than those with more extensive disease at the resection margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. However, there is no evidence that RT improves the prognosis in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There are potential risks and benefits, and ultimately, the decision needs to be individualized, although in practice the presence of carcinoma in situ at the margins is rarely the sole decision-making factor regarding whether or not to use adjuvant RT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Those found to have N2 involvement</strong> &ndash; Although data are somewhat conflicting, most studies suggest no detriment, and even possible benefit, with adjuvant RT for those with N2 disease who have undergone surgical resection. We therefore offer RT to those with a high likelihood of or confirmed N2 disease that has been managed surgically.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Results from the phase III ANITA trial, which evaluated adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with completely resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC, suggest that the effect of postoperative RT is influenced by the extent of nodal involvement and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. For patients with N2 disease, survival was longer in patients who received postoperative RT than in those not given RT (median, 47 versus 24 months in those given adjuvant chemotherapy; 23 versus 13 months in those not given adjuvant chemotherapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. By contrast, for those with N1 disease, RT had a negative effect on survival in those given adjuvant chemotherapy (47 versus 94 months) but a positive effect in those not receiving chemotherapy (50 versus 26 months). Formal statistical comparisons were not performed because of the nonrandomized nature of this subset analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While an earlier meta-analysis of nine randomized trials including 2128 patients suggested worsened outcomes with adjuvant RT (21 percent increase in relative risk of death, or a 7 percent absolute reduction in two-year survival), this detrimental effect appeared to be limited to patients with stage I or II disease on subgroup analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There was no clear evidence of either an adverse or a beneficial effect for those with stage III disease. The results of this meta-analysis are subject to several important limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. For example, the RT techniques (eg, cobalt machines, single RT field) were outdated and greater than 30 percent of the patients included came from a single study in which larger-dose fractions (2.5 Gy) and higher total doses (up to 60 Gy) were permitted than is standard, likely increasing toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Radiation cardiotoxicity may have contributed to mortality in early studies using postoperative RT, with one study suggesting increased cardiac toxicity in the setting of dose-escalated RT (70 to 90 Gy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A decline in cardiac toxicity over time has been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], which may have resulted from technical improvements in the planning and delivery of thoracic radiotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer-and-other-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for breast cancer and other malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prospective randomized trials documenting the effectiveness of postoperative RT in these situations are needed. The ongoing <span class=\"nowrap\">EORTC/IFCT</span> LUNG ART trial in Europe is evaluating the role of sequential postoperative RT in patients with completely resected N2 disease who have received pre- or postoperative chemotherapy (<a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00410683?term=NCT00410683&rank=1&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o/oHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMDmDD/MnH1m6bwVaCXPsAHARJELa7lbES0L/Ob214nrUqCxysxQ1vFE/unqzid4FIA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4623\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT00410683</a>).</p><p/><p>When both adjuvant chemotherapy and RT are planned, RT should be given after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy since concurrent chemoradiotherapy might compromise the ability to deliver the recommended dose and cycles of chemotherapy. There are no data to support the use of adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy. This approach is supported by observational data from the National Cancer Database in patients receiving both chemotherapy and postoperative RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In 757 patients with an R0 resection of the primary tumor and found to have N2 disease, the median overall survival was longer for patients who received chemotherapy before their RT rather than concurrently (median, 59 versus 40 months; p &lt;0.001).

Among UpToDate experts, there is a variation in the threshold to offer surgery after induction therapy, given that, while local control may be improved, no randomized studies have demonstrated a survival benefit to this approach. In the setting of limited data, some experts treat essentially all stage III N2 disease with definitive chemoradiation.</p><p>Others, however, offer induction therapy followed by surgery to a select subset of patients, discussed in a multidisciplinary setting, incorporating input from medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although no prospective randomized data exist to define the subset who would benefit from surgery, factors that lead some experts to offer it include single-station N2 disease that was &lt;3 cm prior to induction therapy, disease that can be resected via lobectomy rather than pneumonectomy, and disease that responded to induction therapy, as evidenced by clearance of mediastinal lymph nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to surgical resection include poor or borderline performance status, poor pulmonary function, active heart disease, progressive disease with induction therapy, extracapsular nodal extension, T4 disease, and multistation N2 disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although need for pneumonectomy is not an absolute contraindication to surgery, such patients less frequently experience benefit from resection relative to those whose disease can be resected with a lobectomy, and the threshold to perform surgery in this setting is higher.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those undergoing surgery, induction chemoradiation or chemotherapy alone may be administered, although this is an area of controversy. In a trial of 232 patients, preoperative sequential chemoradiotherapy did not improve survival relative to preoperative chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], results which were similar to that of an earlier meta-analysis of seven small prospective and retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, clinical trials addressing this question have been limited by small sample size, lack of patients with bulky mediastinal disease, and the use of sequential rather than the concurrent chemoradiation strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. </p><p/><p>Although uncontrolled phase II studies suggested a survival benefit from surgery after induction therapy, randomized phase III trials have not confirmed a survival advantage for surgery following either neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy or induction chemotherapy followed by RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/15,39-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,39-46</a>]. In the Intergroup 0139 trial, including over 400 patients with stage IIIA NSCLC due to N2 disease receiving chemoradiotherapy, the use of surgery was not associated with an improvement in overall survival (five-year survival rate, 27 versus 20 percent; odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.36-1.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. There was, however, a sevenfold increase in the control of the primary tumors and an improvement in five-year progression-free survival (PFS, 22 versus 11 percent).</p><p>An increase in early mortality associated with surgery, particularly in patients undergoing pneumonectomy (26 percent postoperative mortality), may have negated a potential benefit of resection in this subset and the overall group of patients receiving surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43</a>]. An exploratory subgroup analysis suggested that trimodality treatment may be beneficial if a complete resection can be accomplished by lobectomy rather than pneumonectomy. However, this analysis is limited by its post-hoc design, with patients treated with pneumonectomy being more likely to have other adverse prognostic features.</p><p>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 08941 trial also suggested that there was no overall survival difference after induction chemotherapy for those receiving surgery versus RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The two groups also experienced similar PFS. A criticism of this trial, however, is that the study only enrolled patients with unresectable disease, and after induction therapy, only 50 percent of those assigned to surgical resection achieved a complete resection. A third randomized trial, ESPATUE, suggested no survival benefit to surgery after induction therapy over definitive chemoradiation but was closed early due to slow accrual, and furthermore did not provide survival outcomes according to type of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>In sum, these limited and mixed data suggest that survival may not be improved with surgery in an unselected population of patients with N2 disease. There may, however, be a benefit in regards to local control with surgery following induction therapy. Whether subgroups exist that may experience a survival benefit from surgery must be further elucidated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">N3 disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with N3 nodes are treated with definitive concurrent chemotherapy plus RT without surgery.

An early randomized trial suggested that RT (40 to 50 Gy) provided a modest, but significant, survival advantage at one year compared with patients not receiving RT (18 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Shorter courses of RT (eg, 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 17 Gy in 2 fractions) are useful for the palliation of thoracic symptoms (eg, dysphagia, hemoptysis, or dyspnea due to airway obstruction) in patients who are not candidates for more aggressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-stage-iii-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>One trial examined the effect of delayed treatment among asymptomatic patients. Among 230 patients with minimally symptomatic, unresectable NSCLC, randomly assigned to immediate RT or initial supportive care followed by RT at the onset of symptoms, survival between the two groups was similar (8.3 versus 7.9 months, respectively), and the rate of symptom control was similar. However, the treatment intent in this trial was palliation rather than cure and these survival times are grossly inferior to other trial results using immediate chemoradiotherapy.

Many aspects of the treatment of stage III disease are controversial. A multidisciplinary approach is considered essential for management of stage III disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Historically, stage III lung cancer was defined as locoregionally advanced disease due to primary tumor extension into extrapulmonary structures (T3 or T4) or mediastinal lymph node involvement (N2 or N3) without evidence of distant metastases (M0). In the eighth edition of the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system, stage III lung cancers also include tumors greater than 5 cm in size with hilar, intrapulmonary, or peribronchial lymph node involvement (T3N1) or tumors larger than 7 cm (T4), regardless of lymph node involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>).

If complete resection is not technically feasible, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'T3N1 disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-systemic-therapy-in-resectable-non-small-cell-lung-cancer#H2089421064\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant systemic therapy in resectable non-small cell lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Stage II and IIIA disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although survival is often limited by the development of distant metastatic disease, postoperative radiation therapy (RT) may prevent locoregional recurrence and improve survival in carefully selected patients. We use adjuvant radiation for patients with positive surgical margins, those with inadequate lymph node sampling in whom mediastinal node involvement was suspected, and those who are found at surgery to have N2 disease. Some, but not all, UpToDate experts may omit postoperative RT for select cases of single-station N2 disease, in order to avoid excess toxicity (eg, if only one of many N2 nodes was positive). (See <a href=\"#H340526660\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant postoperative RT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, having clinically evident N2 disease, the approach is to treat with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, using platinum-based chemotherapy plus full-dose RT. However, some UpToDate experts offer induction therapy followed by surgery to select patients. (See <a href=\"#H116383941\" class=\"local\">'Chemoradiotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11653701\" class=\"local\">'Surgery in a select subset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Although no prospective randomized data exist to define the subset who would benefit from surgery, factors that lead some UpToDate experts to offer it include single-station N2 disease that was &lt;3 cm prior to induction therapy, disease that can be resected via lobectomy rather than pneumonectomy, and disease that responded to induction therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Contraindications to surgical resection include poor or borderline performance status, progressive disease with induction therapy, extracapsular nodal extension, T4 disease, and multistation N2 disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with N3 disease, concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone is the standard of care. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'N3 disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and RT, we suggest the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=durvalumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">durvalumab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, some experts and patients may reasonably opt to avoid this additional treatment, given the lack of mature overall survival data and the potential for toxicity associated with immunotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those receiving definitive chemoradiation, widely used regimens include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, in conjunction with once daily RT to a total of 60 Gy.
