The condition can also make it hard to get pregnant. People sometimes call polycystic ovary syndrome &quot;PCOS.&quot; It is very common &ndash; about 5 to 8 percent of all women have PCOS. Most women with PCOS are overweight or obese.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194800142\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes PCOS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with PCOS, the ovaries do not work normally and produce too much testosterone. Testosterone is called a &quot;male hormone,&quot; but women have it too. Normally the ovaries produce very small amounts, but in PCOS, they make more.</p><p>About once a month, a woman's ovaries are supposed to make a structure called a &quot;follicle&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). As the follicle grows, it makes hormones. Then, it releases an egg. This is called &quot;ovulation.&quot; But in women with PCOS, the ovary makes many small follicles instead of one big one. Hormone levels can get out of balance. And ovulation doesn't happen every month the way it is supposed to. Doctors aren't sure why this happens to some women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194800149\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of PCOS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with the condition might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have fewer than 8 periods a year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grow thick, dark hair in places where only men tend to grow hair, such as on the upper lip, chin, sideburn area, chest, and belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gain weight and become obese</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have acne (oily skin and pimples on their face)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose hair from their head like men do</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble getting pregnant without medical help</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194800156\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse, even if my symptoms are mild?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Women with PCOS are more likely to have other health problems, too. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes (high blood sugar)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High cholesterol levels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep apnea, a sleep disorder that causes people to briefly stop breathing while they sleep</p><p/><p>The risk of heart disease might also be higher in women with PCOS, but more research is needed for doctors to be sure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194800163\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, symptoms, and individual situation. Possible tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to measure levels of hormones, blood sugar, and cholesterol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pregnancy test if you have missed any periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic ultrasound &ndash; This test uses sound waves to make a picture of your uterus and ovaries. Doctors sometimes use this test to help figure out if you have polycystic ovaries.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194800170\"><span class=\"h1\">How is PCOS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common treatment is to take birth control pills. But there are other treatments than can help with symptoms, too.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth control pills &ndash; This is the main treatment for PCOS. The pills don't cure the condition. But they can improve many of its symptoms, like irregular periods, acne, and facial hair. Birth control pills also protect women from cancer of the uterus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-androgens &ndash; These medicines block hormones that cause some PCOS symptoms like acne and facial hair growth. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Spironolactone</a> (brand name: Aldactone) is the anti-androgen that many doctors use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progestin &ndash; This hormone can make your periods regular, but only if you take it every month. It also lowers the risk of cancer of the uterus. Most doctors use medroxyprogesterone (brand name: Provera) or natural progesterone (brand name: Prometrium).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Metformin</a> (brand name: Glucophage) &ndash; This medicine can help make a woman's periods more regular. But it works only in about half of the women who try it. In women with diabetes, this medicine helps keep blood sugar levels normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicated skin lotion or antibiotics to treat acne</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser therapy or electrolysis to remove extra hair</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28450091\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to treat the condition?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you are overweight or obese, losing weight can improve many of your symptoms. Losing just 5 percent of your body weight can help a lot. That adds up to 10 pounds of weight loss for a 200-pound woman.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194800184\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Don't lose hope. Most women with PCOS are able to get pregnant, but it can take a while. If you are overweight, losing weight can help make your periods regular and improve your chances of getting pregnant. If you lose weight but your periods are still irregular, your doctor can give you medicines to help you ovulate and improve your chances of getting pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194800191\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with PCOS are able to live normal lives. But it is important to see a doctor. Treatments will help your symptoms and protect you from other diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194800198\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hirsutism-excess-hair-growth-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hirsutism (excess hair growth in women) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hirsutism-excess-hair-growth-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hirsutism (excess hair growth in women) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Overview (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
