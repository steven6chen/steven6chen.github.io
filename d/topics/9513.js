When ingested, isopropyl alcohol functions primarily as a central nervous system (CNS) inebriant and depressant, and its toxicity and treatment resemble that of ethanol.</p><p>Fatality from isolated isopropyl alcohol toxicity is rare, but can result from injury due to inebriant effects, untreated coma with airway compromise, or rarely, cardiovascular depression and shock following massive ingestion. Supportive care can avert most morbidity and mortality. It is important to differentiate isopropyl alcohol poisoning from methanol and ethylene glycol, which are more dangerous. Isopropyl alcohol does NOT cause an elevated anion gap acidosis, retinal toxicity (as does methanol), or renal failure (as does ethylene glycol). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.). </p><p>This topic review will discuss the diagnosis and management of isopropyl alcohol intoxication. A summary table to facilitate emergency management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58793\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58793 \">table 1</a>). Discussions of other toxic alcohols and a general approach to the poisoned patient are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethanol-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethanol intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with occult toxic exposure&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isopropyl alcohol is a sedative-hypnotic agent whose toxicity closely resembles that of ethanol, with which it shares strong structural similarity. Like ethanol, isopropyl alcohol's precise mechanism of action in the central nervous system (CNS) remains uncertain. Changes in membrane fluidity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function, and interactions with neurotransmitter receptors, are believed to account for the CNS effects of alcohols and other simple hydrocarbons. There is a linear relationship between the molecular weight of alcohols and their sedative effects: As size increases, so does sedation. Thus, isopropyl alcohol is marginally more potent than ethanol at comparable concentrations.</p><p>In untreated animals, the median lethal dose lies between 4 and 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span>. Many sources mistakenly estimate the lethal dose to be 250 mL in humans (eg, less than 400 mL of a 70 percent solution). It is important to recognize that, with supportive treatment alone, adults and children have survived much larger ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Isopropyl alcohol is metabolized by the alcohol dehydrogenase family of enzymes to acetone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50071\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50071 \">figure 1</a>). Following ingestion of at least several grams, the elimination of acetone is slower than its formation, and this metabolic end-product accumulates. Acetone itself is a mild CNS depressant and may exacerbate the CNS depression caused by isopropyl alcohol (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of overdose'</a> below). It is also responsible for the marked ketosis that is present in most isopropyl alcohol ingestions. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Isopropyl alcohol does NOT cause an elevated anion gap acidosis, unlike the toxic alcohols methanol and ethylene glycol. Methanol and ethylene glycol are both primary alcohols, which are oxidized (via alcohol dehydrogenase and then aldehyde dehydrogenase) to carboxylic acids (formic acid in the case of methanol and glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids in the case of ethylene glycol). These acid metabolites cause the severe toxicity (ie, blindness, renal failure, and death) characteristic of methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Isopropyl alcohol is a secondary alcohol; as such, it is metabolized to a ketone (via alcohol dehydrogenase), rather than an aldehyde. Ketones cannot be oxidized to carboxylic acids. As a result, only very limited acidemia can occur; isopropyl alcohol is considerably less toxic than methanol or ethylene glycol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like ethanol, isopropyl alcohol is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Peak serum concentration and clinical effects occur approximately one to two hours after ingestion. Substantial absorption and even toxicity are possible following dermal exposure, especially in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Isopropyl alcohol is primarily metabolized to acetone via alcohol dehydrogenase, but the affinity of this enzyme family for isopropyl alcohol is approximately an order of magnitude less than for ethanol. Accordingly, small quantities of coingested ethanol effectively block metabolism of isopropyl alcohol and slow its serum elimination. In the absence of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) inhibition, the serum elimination half-life is approximately 2.5 to 8 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Acetone elimination is slower, with a variable half-life of over 10 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. When ADH inhibitors (eg, ethanol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a>) are present, isopropyl alcohol clearance is markedly reduced, with a serum elimination half-life of 28 hours in one case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Both isopropyl alcohol and acetone are rapidly cleared by hemodialysis, with clearance rates in excess of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OVERDOSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14877295\"><span class=\"h2\">Major effect and clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isopropyl alcohol manifests varying degrees of central nervous system (CNS) depression, ranging from inebriation with disinhibition, to sedation, to stupor and coma. These effects, due primarily to the parent alcohol (isopropyl alcohol), develop shortly after exposure, and peak within the first hour after ingestion. The absence of early symptoms excludes a significant isolated ingestion.</p><p>Isopropyl alcohol's primary metabolite, acetone, causes less sedation. Steady improvement in the patient's level of consciousness is the expected clinical course. Of note, cross-tolerance in chronic alcoholics reduces the degree and duration of these effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to attempt to establish the product ingested, ideally by retrieving the original container and consulting product databases. In addition to ascertaining the timing and quantity of isopropyl alcohol ingested, clinicians should attempt to quantify any ethanol coingestion, to learn whether the ingestion was intentional, and, if intentional, to learn whether it was for recreational use or self-harm. Patients who have ingested large amounts of concentrated isopropyl alcohol may complain of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. A discussion of how to approach the patient poisoned with unknown agents is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of poisoning'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with occult toxic exposure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of the critically ill adult with an unknown overdose&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isopropyl alcohol poisoning causes an alteration in mental status similar to that seen in ethanol intoxication. Level of responsiveness, presence of disconjugate gaze, and ciliary reflex should be assessed in any patient with an alteration of mental status. A fruity breath odor is often perceptible, suggesting acetone accumulation. Following massive ingestion, signs of shock may be present, as may hematemesis, pulmonary edema, and hemorrhagic tracheobronchitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to exclude the possibility of methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion in any patient suspected of isopropyl alcohol poisoning. The early clinical course of all the toxic alcohols is quite similar, but important treatment differences exist. The absence of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis four to six hours post-ingestion enables the clinician to distinguish isopropyl alcohol from methanol or ethylene glycol intoxication in most cases. However, the presence of ethanol or the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a> delays the appearance of such an acidosis in methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning, obscuring the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Starvation, alcoholic, and diabetic forms of ketoacidosis can also present with depressed mental status and ketosis. The presence of a metabolic acidosis helps to differentiate these entities from isopropyl alcohol overdose. Ketone bodies other than acetone are produced by these metabolic states; in particular, the presence of beta-hydroxybutyrate demonstrates the ketosis is not due to isopropyl alcohol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fasting ketosis and alcoholic ketoacidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Less common causes of ketosis include inborn errors of metabolism such as branched-chain ketonuria and propionic acidemia, salicylism, and ingestion of acetone itself.

The main use of such testing is to confirm the diagnosis, as treatment is largely supportive. However, many hospitals do not have rapid access to such testing. </p><p>Confirmation of the diagnosis is important when uncertainty exists regarding the cause of a given patient's altered mental status and is essential when another toxic alcohol may be present. Definitive serum levels may also quantify the amount of unmetabolized isopropyl alcohol and provide an estimate of the patient's tolerance. Serum concentrations of at least 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> are necessary to cause a decreased level of consciousness. Isopropyl alcohol may be detected at low concentrations in the serum of patients with severe diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, due to endogenous reduction of acetone to isopropyl alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], and even fatalities may be misattributed to isopropyl alcohol exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Osmolal gap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The osmolal gap provides important diagnostic information when quantitative serum testing for the toxic alcohols is not readily available (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-osmolal-gap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum osmolal gap&quot;</a>). By comparing the measured plasma osmolality (determined by freezing point depression) with the calculated osmolarity, the clinician can infer the presence of an osmotically active, electrically neutral substance present at serum concentrations above 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (ie, at least 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> of isopropyl alcohol and acetone combined). Both isopropyl alcohol and acetone will raise the osmolal gap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The plasma osmolal gap cannot distinguish among isopropyl alcohol, methanol, and ethylene glycol poisoning, and so cannot be used to exclude ingestion of these more toxic alcohols. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unlike methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning, neither a metabolic acidosis nor an elevated anion gap are expected after isopropyl alcohol ingestion. These findings should prompt the clinician to investigate alternative diagnoses.

These tests are calibrated for ketonemia due to endogenous metabolism, and are thus very sensitive to the high acetonemia that follows a substantial ingestion of isopropyl alcohol. Low concentrations of serum ketones exclude any significant isopropyl alcohol exposure, provided at least <strong>two hours</strong> have transpired since ingestion, and alcohol dehydrogenase has not been blocked by coingested ethanol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some laboratories will measure beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations when &quot;serum ketones&quot; are requested. Acetone is the predominant ketone generated by metabolism of isopropyl alcohol, and serum beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations remain low even following large ingestions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acetone concentrations of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or greater can falsely elevate the serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, a high serum creatinine with a normal BUN and pH suggests the possibility of acetonemia due to isopropyl alcohol ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>A clinician caring for a patient with altered mental status attributed to isopropyl alcohol must pursue alternative diagnoses if the patient fails to improve steadily over a few hours of observation. In such circumstances, additional testing, such as computed tomography (CT) of the head, lumbar puncture, and creatine kinase, may be needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management begins with assessment and stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation.

A summary table to facilitate emergency management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58793\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58793 \">table 1</a>).

Intravenous access should be obtained. Intravenous crystalloids are usually sufficient to correct any hypotension due to vasodilatation, but vasopressors may occasionally be required. Hypoglycemia should be corrected. As with ethanol overdose, most symptomatic patients recover within several hours of their ingestion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Decontamination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no role for gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination in most cases of isolated isopropyl alcohol intoxication. Its rapid absorption after oral ingestion and its low toxicity make such interventions unnecessary. Gastric aspiration via a flexible nasogastric tube may be considered if it can be performed within one hour of a massive ingestion, as it may shorten the duration of coma, but this is not a critical intervention. Activated charcoal may be useful for coingestants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since acetone (the primary metabolite) is less toxic than isopropyl alcohol (the parent alcohol), there is no indication for ADH inhibition with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a> or ethanol following isopropyl alcohol exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning/abstract/14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology and toxicology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isopropyl alcohol is rapidly and completely absorbed following oral ingestion. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Kinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to establish with accuracy the product ingested. Clinicians must rule out ingestion of more toxic alcohols (methanol and ethylene glycol), which are associated with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the basic studies obtained in all poisoned patients, the following laboratory tests and calculations should be obtained in the patient suspected of ingesting isopropyl alcohol (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum isopropyl alcohol and acetone levels</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Or serum osmolality (by freezing point depression), with calculation of osmolal gap, <strong>IF</strong> serum isopropyl alcohol level not readily available (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Osmolal gap'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Basic electrolytes, with calculation of osmolal gap (elevated in the setting of any toxic alcohol ingestion)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BUN and creatinine (high serum creatinine with a normal BUN and pH suggest the possibility of acetonemia due to isopropyl alcohol ingestion)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum and urine ketones (low concentrations of serum ketones by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> test exclude any significant isopropyl alcohol exposure, <strong>provided</strong> at least two hours have transpired since ingestion and alcohol dehydrogenase has not been blocked by ethanol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arterial or venous blood gas (the presence of a metabolic acidosis or an anion gap is <strong>NOT</strong> expected with isopropyl alcohol intoxication and should prompt investigation of alternative diagnoses)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For isolated ingestions of isopropyl alcohol, there is no role for antidotal therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a> or ethanol. Gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination and hemodialysis are rarely necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians can manage an isopropyl alcohol overdose in similar fashion to an ethanol overdose. Clinicians should consider tracheal intubation if there is doubt about the patient's ability to protect their airway and avoid aspiration. Hypotension is treated with intravenous crystalloid, and vasopressors if necessary. Rapid recovery with supportive care alone is the expected course. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare patients with massive intentional ingestions are hemodynamically unstable despite supportive treatment. Serum isopropyl alcohol concentrations in such patients are generally over 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and the osmolal gap generally over 100. Clinicians caring for these patients should obtain immediate nephrology consultation. We suggest treatment with hemodialysis for patients with persistent hemodynamic instability despite aggressive treatment with intravenous fluid and pressors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It should be emphasized that treatment with hemodialysis is almost never required. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Massive ingestion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic children with accidental ingestions can be managed with home observation alone, assuming the product composition is known with certainty and the ingestion is estimated to be a mouthful or less.
