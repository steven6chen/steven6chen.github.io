Although it is sometimes stated that chronic pancreatitis &quot;burns out&quot; over time, the duration of time over which this may occur is highly variable, if it occurs at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In addition, pancreatic endocrine and exocrine dysfunction may develop as the disease progresses, and a variety of complications can occur, including pseudocysts, bile duct or duodenal obstruction, pancreatic ascites, splenic vein thrombosis, and pseudoaneurysms.</p><p>Thus, the natural history of chronic pancreatitis is relatively bleak. Most therapies are aimed at &quot;resting&quot; the pancreas by minimizing exocrine pancreatic secretion; unfortunately, this is relatively ineffective. The goals of treatment include pain management, correction of pancreatic insufficiency, and management of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Therapy is similar in patients with acquired and hereditary pancreatitis.</p><p>The treatment of chronic pancreatitis (principally pain and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency) will be reviewed here. Other complications and their management, the etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-complications-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the complications of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and contributing risk factors for chronic pancreatitis in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTABLISH A SECURE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When there is a significant change in the pain pattern or a sudden onset of persistent symptoms, other potential etiologies (eg, peptic ulcer disease, biliary obstruction, pseudocysts, pancreatic carcinoma, and pancreatic duct stricture or stones) should be ruled out. It is difficult to be secure in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, particularly in the first two to three years of disease when most diagnostic studies can be normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PAIN MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal symptom of chronic pancreatitis is abdominal pain. The pain may range from occasional postprandial discomfort to debilitating persistent pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Pain control can be difficult in some cases. However, when considering the appropriate strategy to relieve pain, it should be recognized that placebo alone is effective in up to 30 percent of patients in most studies.</p><p>The first step in alleviating pain is to recognize the underlying cause of chronic pancreatitis and to treat the underlying etiology to reduce progressive pancreatic damage.</p><p>Pain is associated with pancreatic hyperstimulation, ischemia and acidosis, obstruction of larger or small ducts, inflammation or neuropathic mechanisms. Patients with chronic pancreatitis are at increased risk of pancreatic cancer which may cause a change in pain pattern, and often have extrapancreatic sources of pain associated with maldigestion.</p><p>As a general rule, pain management should proceed in a stepwise approach beginning with general recommendations followed by pancreatic enzyme supplementation and then judicious use of analgesics. Patients with continued symptoms may be candidates for more invasive options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">General recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients will improve with these measures early in the course of illness, requiring only occasional non-opioid analgesics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cessation of alcohol intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cessation of alcohol intake is imperative, particularly if this is the underlying etiology of pancreatitis. Abstinence can but does not always lead to symptomatic improvement; however, patients with alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis who continue to drink have increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Small meals and hydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small meals that are low in fat may also help to varying degrees. Although the evidence is anecdotal, keeping patients well hydrated may help prevent flares of pancreatitis.</p><p>Supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medium-chain-triglycerides-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medium chain triglycerides</a> (MCTs) may be of benefit. In a pilot study of eight patients, oral administration of the enteral formula Peptamen, which is enriched in MCTs and hydrolyzed peptides, for 10 weeks resulted in improvement in pain, which in some patients was sustained after stopping this oral supplement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The mechanism of action may relate to the fact that administration of this enteral formulation resulted in a minimal increase in plasma CCK levels or alternatively may be due to its antioxidant effects. MCTs may also be administered to prevent weight loss in individuals who develop steatorrhea. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Medium chain triglycerides'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cessation of smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking may accelerate the progress of chronic pancreatitis and may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic enzyme supplements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic enzyme supplements to suppress pancreatic exocrine secretion relieve pain in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-15</a>].</p><p>Rationale for this therapy is based upon suppression of feedback loops in the duodenum that regulate the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), the hormone that stimulates digestive enzyme secretion from the exocrine pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. CCK-release from the duodenum is regulated by CCK-releasing factors, and these factors are destroyed by pancreatic digestive enzymes. Reduction of intraduodenal free enzyme activity by increasing undigested proteins, protease inhibitors, or inadequate pancreatic enzyme secretion in pancreatic diseases allows the CCK releasing factors to survive protease digestion, stimulate CCK release, and stimulate the pancreas. As a result, increasing intraduodenal enzyme activity may reduce stimulation-associated pancreatic pain.</p><p>However, results from controlled clinical trials showed mixed results, which may have been due to differences in the enzyme preparations used, the endpoints measured, and the high placebo response rates (approximately 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/10-13,15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13,15,17,18</a>].</p><p>Which subsets of patients may benefit most is unclear from the available data. However, the two positive controlled trials suggested that patients with less advanced disease (ie, without involvement of large ducts and without steatorrhea), women, and those with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis may benefit the most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17</a>]. Treatment was unlikely to be successful in patients with large duct disease (mainly those with alcoholic pancreatitis).</p><p>Despite the mixed results, clinical experience plus some evidence from controlled clinical trials suggests a benefit from enzyme supplementation, albeit some of the benefit may reflect a placebo effect. Enzyme supplementation is safe and thus is a reasonable initial strategy in patients with severe pain who have not responded to other conservative measures.</p><p>High doses of the non-enteric coated enzymes were used in the clinical trials. The two clinical trials that demonstrated improvement of pain with pancreatic enzyme supplements used non-enteric coated preparations with each meal, although the newer enteric-coated preparations have not been adequately tested. Patients taking non-enteric coated pancreatic enzyme supplements should also be treated with acid suppression (either with an H2 receptor blocker or a proton pump inhibitor) to reduce inactivation of the enzymes from gastric acid. Non-enteric coated preparations are given in the same manner as the enteric-coated preparations that are used for the treatment of malabsorption. Currently, Viokace is the only non-enteric coated preparation currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Lipase supplementation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analgesia can be considered if pancreatic enzyme therapy fails to control pain. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a> have been shown to reduce daily pain from neuropathic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In many patients, a short course of opiates coupled with low dose amitriptyline (10 mg nightly for three weeks to determine efficacy) and a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug will break the pain cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Simultaneous short-term hospitalization, with the patient kept NPO to minimize pancreatic stimulation, may also be of benefit in breaking the pain cycle.</p><p>Chronic opioid analgesia may be required in patients with persistent significant pain. Long-acting agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> sulfate continuous release or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> patches are generally more effective than short acting medications, which last only three or four hours. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adjuvant therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> (75 mg twice daily with incremental increases to 300 mg twice daily) caused effective pain relief in more patients after three weeks compared to placebo in patients with chronic pancreatitis (36 versus 24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>The extent to which patients should be maintained on analgesics before pursuing more aggressive options is a matter of clinical judgment. As a general rule, additional options should be considered in patients in whom pain significantly reduces their quality of life or their ability to carry on normal social and work functions, especially those who require long-term opiates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10119554\"><span class=\"h2\">Antioxidant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antioxidants in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Studies evaluating the efficacy of antioxidant therapy in reducing pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis have had conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>].</p><p>In one randomized controlled trial, a total of 147 patients with chronic pancreatitis (either alcoholic or idiopathic) were randomly assigned to an antioxidant supplement or placebo for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. At the end of the study, the intervention group experienced a significant reduction in the number of painful days per month and the number of analgesic tablets consumed. In addition, a significantly higher proportion of patients became pain free (32 versus 13 percent). In contrast, in another randomized controlled trial in which 70 patients with chronic pancreatitis (predominantly alcoholic) received antioxidant supplement or placebo for six months, there was no difference in pain scores, quality of life, number of hospital admissions, or outpatient visits between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It is unclear if the conflicting results are due differences in study population (mean age and nutritional status), prevalence of smoking, etiology of pancreatitis (idiopathic versus alcoholic), or composition of the antioxidant supplement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Specialized approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other treatments have been evaluated in patients who were suffering from severe pain refractory to the above measures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Celiac nerve block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous or endoscopic celiac nerve blocks with either alcohol or steroids have had only limited success in chronic pancreatitis and should be considered to be an unproven therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/17,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,28-30</a>]. Even among responders, symptoms frequently recur within two to six months, although the nerve block can be repeated as needed. Furthermore, serious complications have been described. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-celiac-plexus-and-ganglia-interventions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus and ganglia interventions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although randomized trials are lacking, several reports have suggested that endoscopic therapy aimed at decompressing an obstructed pancreatic duct can be associated with pain relief in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-36</a>]. The rationale for this approach is based upon the hypothesis that ductal hypertension due to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction or strictures of the main pancreatic duct lead to pain.</p><p>The largest report with long-term follow-up included 1018 patients treated at eight different centers who were followed for an average of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Obstruction of the pancreatic duct was due to strictures (47 percent), stones (18 percent), or strictures plus stones (32 percent). Patients were treated using a variety of endoscopic techniques. At the end of follow-up, 60 percent had completed endoscopic therapy, while 16 percent were still undergoing some form of endoscopic therapy and 24 percent had undergone surgery. Pain relief (based upon a structured questionnaire) was achieved in 86 percent of the entire group and in 65 percent of patients on intention-to-treat analysis. Pancreatic function did not improve.</p><p>Few studies have compared endoscopic approaches to surgery. A small randomized controlled trial comparing endoscopic therapy to surgical drainage found that surgical drainage was more effective in relieving obstruction and achieving pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Surgery may also be more cost-effective as compared with endoscopic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, most centers would attempt endoscopic therapy prior to surgery unless there is suspicion for pancreatic cancer. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pancreatic-stenting-and-its-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pancreatic stenting and its complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic duct stones are found in approximately 22 to 60 percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis. The stones can lead to obstruction of the outflow of pancreatic secretions, causing increased intraductal pressure. Because the pancreas is relatively noncompliant, the rise in intraductal pressure can induce tissue hypertension and ischemia, which may be a major factor causing pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) creates millimetric fragmentation of pancreatic stones, which has improved the results of endoscopic therapy and may have additional indications in the treatment of patients with chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy-for-pancreatic-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for pancreatic stones&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ESWL is used mostly in Europe, although it is also available in a few specialized centers in the United States. Complete or partial pain relief was observed in 62 to 86 percent of carefully selected patients in the largest series during a mean follow-up ranging from 7 to 44 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The role of ESWL remains unclear, since there have been no definitive controlled trials that have proven its benefit. Furthermore, the relationship between pancreatic stones and symptoms is not straightforward since many patients with stones (even with ductal dilation) are asymptomatic, while those with symptoms generally have pain due to small duct obstruction and other factors such as parenchymal inflammation and ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pilot study involving single-dose external beam radiotherapy in 15 patients with chronic pancreatitis suggested a benefit in improving pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The mechanism of benefit is unclear but may be related to antiinflammatory properties of radiotherapy. Additional studies are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery has generally been considered for patients who fail medical therapy, or as first line therapy if there is suspicion of pancreatic cancer. Notably, up to 15 percent of patients in surgical series had unrecognized pancreatic cancer at the time of the procedure, underscoring the need for a firm diagnosis prior to surgery. Although a role for surgery in chronic pancreatitis is generally accepted, there have been very few controlled clinical trials to demonstrate its benefit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The timing of surgery is controversial. While some studies suggest that early surgery may prevent the development of progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and reduce the need for long-term opioid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], others have noted progressive loss of endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function despite a lateral pancreaticojejunostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>].</p><p>When choosing among surgical options, one must consider the areas of the pancreas that are involved in chronic pancreatitis and whether the pancreatic duct is dilated.</p><p>Three surgical approaches have been described: <span class=\"nowrap\">decompression/drainage</span> operations; pancreatic resections; and denervation procedures. Some surgical procedures employ a combination of these approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Decompression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decompression procedures have generally been recommended for patients with refractory pain who have a dilated main pancreatic duct. The normal pancreatic duct ranges from 2 to 4 mm in diameter (most narrow in the tail, enlarging as it passes toward the ampulla). A dilated duct (from a surgical standpoint) is one that would permit anastomosis to a loop of jejunum. Consensus has not been achieved at the threshold at which this can be achieved; some surgeons will perform such a procedure in those with ducts that are only 5 to 6 mm in diameter, while others require dilation to around 10 mm.</p><p>Multiple series have described the outcome of this procedure and its variants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67361\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67361 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61669%7EGAST%2F50008\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61669 graphicRef50008 \">figure 2A-B</a>). A review of these data in a consensus statement from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) focused on five reports that were selected because of their relatively large numbers of patients, longer follow-up, and methodologic quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-50</a>]. The data suggest that short-term pain relief is achieved in approximately 80 percent of patients. Morbidity and mortality related to the operation are generally low when the procedure has been performed by experienced surgeons (0 to 5 percent).</p><p>However, pain relief persists for more than two years in only about 60 percent of patients. Patients with recurrent pain may require additional surgery. The cause of pain recurrence is unclear. It may be related to progressive pancreatic injury or inadequate drainage of secondary ducts.</p><p>How these outcomes compare with resection procedures has not been extensively studied in randomized studies, but tend to favor drainage approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Surgery may be superior to endoscopic approaches for pain control in patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis and dilated pancreatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In a study of 140 patients, surgery was superior to endotherapy in the reduction of pain at the five-year follow-up, although the initial success rates were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, in this study, surgery included both resection and drainage procedures and endoscopic lithotripsy was not performed. A subsequent randomized controlled trial compared operative pancreaticojejunostomy to endoscopic treatment in 39 patients with chronic pancreatitis and a distal obstruction of the pancreatic duct without an inflammatory mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Endoscopic treatment included transampullary drainage with or without lithotripsy. Pain scores were significantly lower in the surgery group after 24 months of follow-up. Complete or partial pain relief was achieved in a great proportion of patients who underwent surgery compared with endoscopic therapy (75 versus 32 percent). Complications rates were similar. In a follow-up study of the same cohort, patients who underwent surgery as the initial treatment as compared to endoscopic therapy required significantly fewer additional drainage procedures (68 versus 5 percent) and had more pain relief (80 versus 38 percent) during 79 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Furthermore, 47 percent of patients who underwent endoscopic therapy eventually underwent surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This surgical approach involves resection usually of a portion of the pancreas (typically the tail or head) and less commonly the entire pancreas. Several specific procedures have been described including the Whipple, pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59715\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59715 \">figure 3</a>), distal pancreatectomy, total pancreatectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68307\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68307 \">figure 4</a>), and a duodenal-preserving resection of the pancreatic head. Resection is considered in patients who have failed other forms of therapy and in those who are not candidates for a drainage procedure (usually patients with predominantly small duct disease).</p><p>Patients who have undergone pancreatectomy may develop exocrine and endocrine dysfunction. In otherwise healthy people, only about 20 percent of the pancreatic parenchyma is required to maintain clinically adequate function. Patients with chronic pancreatitis, however, may not have a normal remaining pancreas, increasing the likelihood that pancreatic insufficiency will develop with extensive resection. The resulting diabetes can be severe and associated with considerable morbidity.</p><p>Autologous islet cell transplantation may hold promise for treatment of such patients. The islets are separated from the pancreas and then infused into the portal vein. Many of these patients have had normoglycemia and normal serum insulin responses to oral and intravenous glucose and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> for up to seven years after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In one series, 10 of 14 patients receiving more than 300,000 islets were insulin-independent two years after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus#H2605677717\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreas and islet transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Chronic pancreatitis'</a>.)</p><p>Several conclusions can be drawn from heterogeneous data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/58-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-71</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal pancreatectomy alone is insufficient unless disease is confined to the body and tail of the pancreas (eg, occlusion of the mid pancreatic duct, or a pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection of the pancreatic head (by a conventional or pylorus-preserving procedure) may provide pain relief in up to 85 percent of patients, including those with disease extending to the tail. However, it remains controversial whether this type of surgery is effective in most patients versus those whose disease is primarily confined to this region. A meta-analysis of four trials concluded that duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection was as effective as pancreatoduodenectomy for relief of pain, overall morbidity and postoperative endocrine insufficiency and was superior in some postoperative outcomes and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total pancreatectomy is a treatment option in carefully selected patients with chronic pancreatitis in whom substance abuse is not a confounding factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>]. A systematic review included five observational studies in which 296 patients with chronic pancreatitis underwent total pancreatectomy followed by islet cell autotransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In the two studies that reported postoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> requirements, there was a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of pain following surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Denervation procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most afferent nerves emanating from the pancreas pass through the celiac ganglion and splanchnic nerves. Thus, interruption of these nerve fibers has the potential to alleviate pain originating from the pancreas. Interruption of these pathways also occurs with pancreaticoduodenectomy and with resection of the pancreatic head, which may in part explain the pain relief achieved with these procedures.</p><p>Denervation has been accomplished using an open surgical approach and using thoracoscopic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/73-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-79</a>]. However, in most series, pain relief with thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy was incomplete and of short duration with only about one-half of patients noting a benefit after two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>].</p><p>The overall benefit from denervation surgery is uncertain. While a response rate as high as 90 percent has been reported, patients in this series also underwent additional procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Which patients may benefit the most from this option is incompletely understood. One study suggested a higher response rate in patients who had not undergone prior operative or endoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">STEATORRHEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe pancreatic exocrine dysfunction cannot properly digest complex foods or absorb digestive breakdown products. Nevertheless, clinically significant protein and fat deficiencies do not occur until over 90 percent of pancreatic function is lost. Steatorrhea (fat malabsorption) usually occurs prior to protein deficiencies since lipolytic activity decreases faster than proteolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-and-acute-recurrent-pancreatitis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of fat malabsorption include loose, greasy, foul smelling stools that are difficult to flush. Malabsorption of the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> may also occur, although clinically symptomatic vitamin deficiency is rare.</p><p>A variety of tests can be used to detect fat malabsorption. Currently, the gold standard for diagnosis of steatorrhea is quantitative estimation of stool fat. Fecal elastase testing is the test of choice due to its high sensitivity and specificity and because only a random stool sample is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with pancreatic enzyme supplementation in chronic pancreatitis is dependent on the size and nature of the meal (fat content), the residual function of the pancreas (which may be progressively lost), and the goals of therapy (elimination of steatorrhea, reduction in the abdominal symptoms of maldigestion (bloating, diarrhea), or improvement in nutrition, depending on the size and condition of the patient).</p><p>Treatment depends upon the severity of disease. It may involve dietary modifications alone or with the addition of pancreatic digestive enzyme supplementation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One approach in patients with steatorrhea is to restrict fat intake. The degree of restriction depends upon the severity of fat malabsorption; generally intake of 20 grams per day or less is sufficient. Patients who continue to suffer from steatorrhea following fat restriction require medical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipase supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since all of the digestive enzymes are secreted in parallel, lipase can be used to titrate pancreatic enzyme supplement doses. The contents of the stomach empty into the intestine at a slow continuous rate, so the pancreas functions at a high rate for most of the day. The pancreas normally responds with between 700,000 and 1,000,000 lipase units (USP) per meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. With no pancreatic function, 10 percent of normal pancreatic lipase replacement (70,000 to 100,000 USP) will control steatorrhea, but may not correct other effects of pancreatic exocrine failure. Patients with chronic pancreatitis typically have some residual pancreatic function, thus supplementation rather than complete replacement is usually sufficient. The dosing of pancreatic enzyme supplements is based on relief of the target symptoms or achievement of nutritional goals since residual pancreatic function is difficult to measure and changes with progression of disease, the size and content of meals vary, and multiple commercial products are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57416 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In order to correct for malabsorption due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, it is necessary to provide approximately 5 to 10 percent of the pancreatic enzymatic output. Studies have shown that the quantity of enzymatic output needed to provide approximately 5 to 10 percent of pancreatic enzyme output is approximately 30,000 international units (IU) or 90,000 United States Pharmacopeia units (USP) of lipase per meal. The minimal amount of lipase needed will differ among individuals, but in most persons 90,000 USP of lipase per meal is the amount that will be needed to abolish steatorrhea. Dosing depends on an individual's weight, the degree of pancreatic insufficiency, and the size and fat content of a meal. Protein malabsorption with associated diarrhea (azotorrhea) can also be seen in chronic pancreatitis. In general, protein malabsorption is easier to correct than fat malabsorption. This is due to the fact that proteases are much more resilient to degradation than lipases, and proteases in the stomach and small intestine can compensate for decreased amounts of pancreatic proteases. </p><p>Once the appropriate dose of pancreatic enzymes is determined, patients should be instructed on how to take the pancreatic enzymes. Enzymes should be taken with the first bite of a meal. Depending on how rapidly a meal is consumed and the amount of food consumed, the enzyme supplements may be given entirely at the beginning of a meal or, alternatively, with one half of the total dose at the beginning of the meal and the other half taken in the middle of the meal. This dosing regimen ensures that there will be appropriate mixing of enzymes with food.</p><p>Pancreatic enzyme supplements come in various forms (including delayed release, enteric coated, and non-enteric coated), which contain varying concentrations of lipase, protease, and amylase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57416 \">table 1</a>). Viokace is currently the only non-enteric coated formulation currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Treatment can be with either enteric coated formulations such as Creon-24,000 lipase, one to two capsules with meals and one capsule with a snack, or a non-enteric coated form such as Viokace Lipase 20,880, three tablets with meals and one to two tablets with a snack. This dose is typically sufficient to improve symptoms. Non-enteric coated enzyme supplements may be inactivated at an acidic pH. Thus, patients taking non-enteric coated pancreatic enzyme supplements require addition of an H2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor. Non-enteric coated formulations may be more successful in patients who are achlorhydric or who have dyssynchronous gastric emptying (eg, Billroth II anatomy), since there is no need to protect the enzymes from acid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with substantial steatorrhea may require fat-soluble vitamin analogues. The 25-hydroxylated form of vitamin D (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcifediol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcifediol</a>) is more polar than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d2-ergocalciferol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin D2</a> or D3 and is therefore more easily absorbed in patients with fat malabsorption. The serum calcium should be monitored for the first few weeks of therapy with this naturally occurring analogue since it is more potent than vitamin D2 or D3, and can more easily produce hypercalcemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Medium chain triglycerides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medium-chain-triglycerides-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Medium chain triglycerides</a> (MCTs) can provide extra calories in patients with weight loss and a poor response to diet and pancreatic enzyme therapy. Unlike long chain triglycerides, which require bile salts and pancreatic lipase, MCTs are readily degraded by gastric and pancreatic lipase, and do not require the presence of bile. In addition, MCTs can be directly absorbed by the intestinal mucosa and are less of a stimulant to pancreatic secretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose intolerance occurs with some frequency in chronic pancreatitis, but overt diabetes mellitus usually occurs late in the course of disease. Annual fasting glucose levels are generally checked and, if elevated, would indicate the development of diabetes. Diabetes that develops in patients with chronic pancreatitis is usually insulin requiring. However, it is different from typical type 1 diabetes in that the pancreatic alpha cells, which produce glucagon, are also affected; as a result, there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia, both treatment-related and spontaneous. A trial of oral hypoglycemic agents followed by insulin therapy when the need arises has been the line of management in these patients.
