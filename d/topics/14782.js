The trials did not include definitive therapy at the first evidence of disease progression, do not compare the impact of radical prostatectomy with other active treatments approaches, and need to be distinguished from active surveillance, where definitive therapy is delayed and instituted only when evidence of progression is present.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 4 trial, 695 men with clinical stage T1 or T2 prostate cancer were randomly assigned to radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting, with active therapy deferred until advanced disease was present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With a maximum follow-up of 23 years (median 13 years), men randomized to radical prostatectomy had a significantly lower incidence of death from all causes (56 versus 69 percent), death from prostate cancer (18 versus 29 percent), distant metastases (26 versus 38 percent), and use of androgen deprivation therapy (43 versus 67 percent) compared with those assigned to watchful waiting. The benefits were most pronounced in those less than 65 years of age at diagnosis and in those with intermediate risk disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the PIVOT trial, 731 men with T1-T2NxM0 prostate cancer were randomly assigned to radical prostatectomy or observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Men assigned to observation were offered palliative therapy for symptomatic or metastatic progression. Although the difference in overall survival and prostate cancer mortality did not reach statistical significance, the trial did not complete its planned accrual and was underpowered; it also included predominantly older men with substantial comorbidities. With a minimum follow-up of death or 12 years, and a maximum follow-up of 19 years, 223 of 364 patients (61 percent) assigned to surgery had died, and 245 of 367 (67 percent) assigned to observation had died (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-1.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Compared with an open technique, minimally invasive approaches use a smaller incision. Analyses of large databases indicate that the usage of robotic surgery has increased rapidly and now constitutes a majority of radical prostatectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Comparative studies of efficacy and side effects have not established the superiority of one approach over another, and the observed differences may reflect differences in case selection and lack of long term follow-up.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multinational, multi-institutional study suggests that the incidence of positive surgical margins is lower with a minimally invasive approach, although the long-term clinical significance of positive margins is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Positive margins increase the risk of biochemical recurrence but do not affect the risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-pathologic-stage-t3-disease-or-positive-surgical-margins-following-radical-prostatectomy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate cancer: Pathologic stage T3 disease or positive surgical margins following radical prostatectomy&quot;, section on 'Positive margins'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a series of 22,393 men undergoing prostatectomy between 2000 and 2011, the overall rates of positive surgical margins for the open, laparoscopic, and robotic techniques were 23, 16, and 14 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, results varied significantly based upon the volume of cases within a given center, reflecting the importance of the experience of the center and the surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H21779374\" class=\"local\">'Experience of the surgeon'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis from the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) in a community-based setting included 1137 men who underwent open radical prostatectomy and 755 treated with robot-assisted prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer between 2004 and 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Oncologic outcomes were very similar for open and robot-assisted surgery in terms of positive surgical margins (27 versus 24 percent, respectively) and biochemical recurrence-free survival (87 versus 85 percent, respectively). Based on self-reported quality of life questionnaires, patients managed with open prostatectomy had better urinary function in the first year after surgery. However, there were no significant differences in urinary incontinence at one to two and two to three years after surgery. There were no significant differences in sexual functioning at any time point.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two large observational database studies suggested that a minimally invasive approach might offer advantages in terms of short length of stay and a decreased frequency of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. However, single institution series from academic centers suggest that both approaches result in similar lengths of stay without differences in post discharge recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial to compare the safety and efficacy of the two approaches, 326 men were randomly assigned to either open radical prostatectomy or robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a report of early outcomes, there was no significant difference in urinary or sexual function scores through 12 weeks, nor was there a significant difference in the incidence of positive surgical margins. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21779374\"><span class=\"h2\">Experience of the surgeon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The experience of the surgeon is a critical factor associated with a successful outcome following radical prostatectomy regardless of whether an open or minimally invasive technique is utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The impact of surgical volume on outcome is illustrated by two large studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open prostatectomy &ndash; In a series of 7765 men who underwent open radical prostatectomy by one of 72 surgeons at four US academic medical centers between 1987 and 2003, the learning curve did not plateau until a surgeon had performed at least 250 retropubic radical prostatectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The probability of biochemical recurrence at five years was significantly lower when the surgeon had performed 250 prior operations (10.7 versus 17.9 percent when the surgeon had performed 10 prior operations).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimally invasive prostatectomy &ndash; In a series of 4702 men who were managed with laparoscopic prostatectomy by one of 29 surgeons at seven centers, the five-year risk of recurrence progressively decreased with increasing experience (17, 16, and 9 percent with 10, 250, and 750 prior laparoscopic procedures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A similar prolonged learning curve with robotic radical prostatectomy has been seen in both multicenter and single surgeon studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24078947\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative counseling that includes the spouse or partner is essential to address the practical and emotional issues surrounding radical prostatectomy. Presurgical psychosocial interventions including a focus on stress management may be useful in improving quality of life following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>One of the most important goals prior to treatment is to set reasonable expectations for the short-term and long-term effects of surgery on activity level, continence, and potency. Emphasis is placed on the type of anesthesia to be used, whether or not lymphadenectomy will be performed, and whether or not a nerve-sparing procedure is contemplated, as well as the anticipated length of hospital stay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H683372924\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve-sparing approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erectile function following radical prostatectomy depends upon preservation of the autonomic cavernous nerves, located within the neurovascular bundles. Every effort should be made to preserve the bilateral neurovascular bundles as long as cancer control is not compromised. (See <a href=\"#H24077796\" class=\"local\">'Impotence'</a> below.)</p><p>Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy can be performed safely in men with pathologic extraprostatic extension as long as the neurovascular bundles are not involved. The decision to perform a nerve-sparing approach is made during surgery based upon visual inspection and palpation of the gland and its relationship to the nerve bundle. If there is a clinical suspicion of extraprostatic extension involving the neurovascular bundles, intraoperative frozen section analysis may be useful. </p><p>Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate may also be useful in guiding the surgical approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-in-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24077780\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic lymph node dissection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1302101\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications and extent of dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the widespread introduction of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, most patients are diagnosed with localized disease and there has been a concomitant decrease in the percentage of patients with regional lymph node involvement at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. However, the decreased utilization of PSA screening due to changes in screening guidelines may be contributing to an increased incidence of men with metastatic disease and a decreased incidence of men with low-risk prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)'</a>.)</p><p>Key factors that are associated with an increased risk of occult lymph node metastases include a higher clinical tumor stage, Gleason score of 7 or more, and a higher serum PSA.</p><p>The need for pelvic lymph node dissection in conjunction with radical prostatectomy is determined by the risk of regional lymph node involvement, which is based upon the extent of the local tumor (T stage), serum PSA, or Gleason score. Pelvic lymph node dissection can be omitted in patients with low risk disease and is usually performed in all others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-risk-stratification-and-choice-of-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The extent of a pelvic lymph node dissection has a major impact on the frequency with which positive lymph nodes are detected as well as on the incidence of complications. The optimal extent of pelvic lymph node dissection is uncertain, but the available evidence suggests that an extended dissection is preferable, especially in patients with very high risk disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>].</p><p>Historically, pelvic lymph node dissection was limited to the obturator fossa and nodes associated with the external iliac vein. However, the primary lymphatic drainage of the prostate often bypasses these nodes and goes directly to the common iliac, hypogastric, paraaortic, presacral, or perirectal lymph nodes. A more extensive dissection not only yields greater numbers of positive nodes but also can identify lymph node involvement when the nodes within a more limited template are negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/21,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25-27</a>].</p><p>An improvement in survival from a pelvic lymph node dissection has not been demonstrated in randomized trials. However, the prolonged survival of men with microscopic lymph node involvement at pathologic staging suggests that pelvic lymph node dissection may be curative in some men.
