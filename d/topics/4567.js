As in patients without SLE, the decision to use prophylactic low-dose aspirin in patients with SLE must be individualized and based on the estimated risk of a first cardiovascular event. While calculators to estimate this risk do not incorporate SLE, we consider SLE to be a risk factor similar to that of diabetes mellitus given the increased risk of CHD in this population. Importantly, other medications commonly used in patients with SLE (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and glucocorticoids) may further increase the risk of bleeding.

Abnormal perfusion imaging was a better predictor of cardiac events than an elevated Framingham risk score (hazard ratios of 13 versus 1.8, respectively).

Patients with SLE have an increased prevalence of traditional risk factors, and the disease itself and treatment with glucocorticoids are powerful risk factors for CHD. Patients with lupus nephritis and those with antiphospholipid antibodies are among those at highest risk. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Traditional risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high index of suspicion for CHD is warranted in patients with SLE.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other causes of chest pain in patients with SLE include: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, reflux esophagitis, and pulmonary hypertension. The evaluation of patients with SLE suspected of having CHD is similar to that of other patients without lupus. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention and treatment of CHD are similar in many respects in patients with and without SLE. Beneficial interventions include: not smoking, exercising regularly, optimizing lipid levels (based upon guidelines and risk categories using traditional risk factors to assess cardiovascular risk), achieving goal blood pressure in those with hypertension, use of prophylactic low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> if not contraindicated and after consideration of bleeding risk, and minimizing or avoiding use of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies using noninvasive screening tests such as exercise or pharmacologic cardiac stress testing, electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) scanning, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrasonography of the carotid or femoral arteries support an increased prevalence of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease in patients with SLE. However, we do not suggest using these tests to screen asymptomatic patients with SLE for CHD in the absence of other traditional risk factors for coronary disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SLE and other traditional risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis are a group for whom further evaluation for CHD may be pursued in the absence of cardiac symptoms, and consultation with a preventive cardiologist may be beneficial. If, after a discussion of the risks and potential benefits of testing, a patient and clinician decide to proceed, we suggest exercise electrocardiography for the patient who is able to exercise, or pharmacologic cardiac stress testing with radionuclide imaging for those who cannot exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that statins not be used routinely in asymptomatic patients with SLE for primary prevention of CHD, unless otherwise indicated (eg, in those with known CHD, multiple risk factors for CHD, or hypercholesterolemia that is inadequately controlled by lifestyle and dietary modification) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
