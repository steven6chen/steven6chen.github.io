Malignant ovarian sex cord-stromal neoplasms are rare, comprising only 1.2 percent of all primary ovarian cancers (malignant neoplasms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In contrast with epithelial ovarian cancer, most patients with malignant sex cord-stromal neoplasms are diagnosed with early-stage disease; even malignant neoplasms are generally considered to be low grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

These may result in symptoms of estrogen excess or other effects, and measurement of these and other tumor markers may play a role in diagnosis.</p><p>General principles of ovarian sex cord-stromal neoplasms are reviewed here.

Based upon data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) United States national cancer database from 1992 to 1999, the overall incidence of these neoplasms was 0.2 per 100,000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rate was higher for black women than white women (0.44 versus 0.18 per 100,000). Malignant sex cord-stromal neoplasms comprised only 1.2 percent of all cases of ovarian cancer (malignant neoplasms); granulosa cell neoplasms were the most common subtype (1 percent of all ovarian cancer cases).</p><p>The age distribution of sex cord-stromal neoplasms is somewhat younger than that of epithelial neoplasms, which are the most common histologic type of ovarian cancer. The average age at diagnosis of sex cord-stromal neoplasms was 50 years (compared with 61 years for epithelial cancer) in the SEER data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among women with sex cord-stromal neoplasms, 12 percent were younger than 30 years, and 57 percent were between ages 30 to 59.</p><p>Malignant sex cord-stromal neoplasms are often diagnosed at an early stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 2</a>). Disease was confined to the ovary in 57 percent of women based upon the SEER data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There are few data regarding risk factors for sex cord-stromal neoplasms. Some data suggest that granulosa cell neoplasms are more likely to occur in women who are nonwhite, obese, and have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The risk appears to be decreased in women who are current or past smokers or users of oral contraceptive pills and in those who are parous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22874274\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic basis of sex cord-stromal tumors is under investigation. A somatic mutation in <em>FOXL2</em> may be associated with granulosa cell tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. <em>FOXL2</em> encodes a transcription factor that is expressed as a nuclear protein and is critically important in the development of granulosa cells. Mutations in <em>DICER1</em> are associated with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors and other nonepithelial ovarian cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <em>DICER1 </em>is an endoribonuclease in the RNase III family that is essential for processing microRNAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sequencing of these gene mutations may assist in the diagnosis of these rare neoplasms. In addition, a study demonstrated that the immunohistochemical staining for <em>FOXL2</em> may also be used as an aid in diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. To date, neither of these somatic mutations has been found to be impacted by medication, so targeted therapy has not become a reality. In addition, and very importantly, germline <em>DICER1 </em>mutations are associated with a number of clinical conditions other than ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, including pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), lung cysts, cystic nephroma, thyroid nodular hyperplasia and differentiated carcinomas, and cervical sarcoma botryoides. Thus, the finding of any of these conditions in a patient raises the issue of screening other family members who may be at risk.</p><p>Sex cord-stromal neoplasms have no known association with the BRCA germline mutations or a genetic predisposition to breast cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4401832\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445004979\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian sex cord-stromal neoplasms arise from the dividing cells that would typically give rise to specialized gonadal stroma surrounding the oocytes, including granulosa cells, theca cells, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and fibroblasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72286\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72286 \">figure 1</a>).

They may display indifferent morphologic features, such as fibroblastic differentiation, and may contain other areas of nonepithelial differentiation (eg, cartilage or skeletal muscle) or areas of epithelial differentiation (&quot;heterologous elements&quot;). This may happen because the dividing cell population from which these neoplasms arise may still have capacity for various lines of differentiation. Most consist of ovarian cell types, but testicular (Sertoli cell) and mixed ovarian and testicular (gynandroblastoma) cell types can occur.</p><p>The histology of sex cord-stromal neoplasm subtypes is described in detail separately.

As an example, in a retrospective series of 87 patients with mostly granulosa cell or Sertoli-Leydig cell neoplasms, there were no patients with positive lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The diagnosis should therefore be suspected in patients who present with signs of estrogen excess (eg, precocious puberty in a child, abnormal uterine bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma) or androgen excess (virilization), especially if an adnexal mass is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727614\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a suspected ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor should have a complete pelvic examination to evaluate for an adnexal mass and, if present, to determine size and mobility. In addition, a general physical examination should be performed to evaluate for findings that suggest advanced or metastatic disease (eg, ascites). The physical examination of women with suspected ovarian cancer is discussed in detail separately.

In patients with symptoms of hormonal abnormalities (eg, estrogen or androgen excess), appropriate hormonal testing should be performed.

Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound is typically the study of choice for initial evaluation. The presence and characteristics of an adnexal mass can be described. In addition, women with a suspected sex cord-stromal tumor should have evaluation of the endometrium to exclude endometrial thickening as a result of estrogen excess.</p><p>Ultrasound is typically sufficient for the evaluation of adnexal masses, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used if further characterization of an adnexal mass is needed.

Endometrial neoplasia should be diagnosed preoperatively, if possible, to allow appropriate surgical planning. For women with a suspected sex cord-stromal neoplasm, endometrial sampling should be performed to evaluate premenopausal women with irregular or heavy uterine bleeding, postmenopausal women with an adnexal mass and a thickened (&gt;4 to 5 mm) endometrial stripe, and the occasional patient who has a preoperative diagnosis of ovarian granulosa cell neoplasm.

While the diagnosis may be suspected preoperatively based on the presence of an adnexal mass combined with signs of estrogen or androgen excess or elevated levels of serum tumor markers, the specific histologic type and classification into benign or malignant can be confirmed only with histologic evaluation of the ovary. Most commonly, the diagnosis is made postoperatively.</p><p>When an ovarian malignant neoplasm is suspected, the entire ovary must be removed. Biopsy of the ovary or cystectomy results in potential in spread of neoplastic cells and upstaging that impacts prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H13733541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Surgical evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-staging-and-initial-surgical-management#H10115882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management&quot;, section on 'Capsule rupture'</a>.)</p><p>The histologic diagnosis is typically made postoperatively upon final pathologic evaluation.

(See <a href=\"#H530204\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial sampling'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H13733533\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529930\"><span class=\"h3\">Staging system and procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The staging system for ovarian sex cord-stromal cancer is the same as that used for other primary ovarian cancers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 2</a>). In brief, stage I disease is confined to the ovaries, stage II includes extension into other pelvic tissues, stage III refers to disease that has spread beyond the pelvis or to retroperitoneal lymph nodes but remains in the abdomen, and stage IV refers to the presence of distant metastasis or involvement of liver parenchyma.</p><p>Complete surgical staging includes a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH-BSO). One notable difference between sex cord-stromal versus other ovarian neoplasms is that lymph node metastases are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] (see <a href=\"#H728063\" class=\"local\">'Patterns of spread'</a> above). Pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy may result in lymphedema that impacts postoperative quality of life. Thus, for most women with malignant sex cord-stromal neoplasms, we suggest <strong>not</strong> performing pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Nodes should be palpated, however, and lymphadenectomy is required for women with palpable nodal enlargement. Pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy should also be performed in women in whom there is a suspicion of a different histologic type of ovarian malignant neoplasm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis following pelvic lymph node dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since the definitive diagnosis is often not made pre- or intraoperatively, the surgeon will need to make a decision about which surgical option to employ based on imperfect histologic information. As noted above, since these are rare neoplasms, even expert gynecologic pathologists may not provide a definite diagnosis based upon intraoperative frozen section examination. Epithelial neoplasms (particularly endometrioid carcinoma) can mimic sex-cord stromal neoplasms, and, if diagnosis is uncertain, this should be communicated to the surgeon (and patient).</p><p>Intraoperative decisions regarding TAH-BSO versus conservative surgery are made based upon the patient's preferences and the operative findings.
