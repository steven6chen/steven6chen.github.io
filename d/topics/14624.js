These values cannot be measured from an indwelling pulmonary artery catheter; rather, they are measured during catheter insertion using the distal tip of the catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-artery-catheters-insertion-technique-in-adults#H462362391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary artery catheters: Insertion technique in adults&quot;, section on 'Transitioning from the SVC or RA to the RV'</a>.)</p><p>Normal RV systolic pressure varies from 15 to 25 mmHg and normal RV end-diastolic pressure varies from 3 to 12 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70326 \">table 2</a>). As a general rule, elevations in RV pressure are associated with diseases that elevate the pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonic valve disorders, and diseases that primarily affect the right ventricle. Each category differentially elevates the RV pressure in the following manner: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary vascular and pulmonic valve disorders &ndash; An elevated RV systolic pressure is seen in pulmonary hypertension and pulmonic stenosis, or pulmonary embolism. Elevations &gt;40 mmHg are unusual but when seen, are typically due to chronic elevations in pulmonary pressures. Pulmonic stenosis is characterized by a systolic pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RV disorders &ndash; An increase in RV end-diastolic pressure is typically seen in cardiomyopathy, RV ischemia, RV infarction, cardiac constriction, cardiac tamponade, or RV failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension. These pathologies will also cause a mild elevation in RV systolic pressure but generally not as severe as the causes listed above.</p><p/><p>On the RV pressure waveform, ventricular systole is represented by a prominent upstroke and downstroke, while ventricular diastole is represented by a more gradual upstroke that consists of an early rapid filling phase (during which approximately 60 percent of filling occurs), a slow filling phase (during which another 25 percent of filling occurs), and an atrial systolic phase (which produces the a wave in the RV tracing). End diastole occurs immediately after the a wave. An illustrative RV pressure waveform is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72775\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72775 \">figure 4</a>). Additional discussion of normal RV waveforms is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-techniques-normal-hemodynamics#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac catheterization techniques: Normal hemodynamics&quot;, section on 'Right ventricle'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressures range from 15 to 25 mmHg, while PA diastolic pressures range from 8 to 15 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70326 \">table 2</a>). The mean PA pressure (mPAp) is typically 16 mmHg (10 to 22 mmHg). The mean PA pressure can be elevated (eg, mPAp, &gt;22 mmHg) by acute conditions (eg, venous thromboembolism or hypoxemic-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction), by acute-on-chronic conditions (eg, hypoxemic-induced vasoconstriction in a patient with underlying chronic cardiopulmonary disease), or by chronic conditions (eg, pulmonary hypertension [PH]). Although PH is defined as a mPAp &ge;25 mmHg, many of the etiologies associated with PH will also result in mild elevations of the PA pressure. Causes of PH include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and prognosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (eg, idiopathic, connective tissue disease, congenital heart disease; Group 1)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PH due to left heart disease (eg, left heart failure, mitral valvular disease; Group 2)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PH due to chronic lung disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxemia (eg, emphysema, interstitial lung disease; Group 3)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PH due to chronic pulmonary thromboembolism (Group 4)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PH due to multifactorial mechanisms (eg, sickle cell disease; Group 5)</p><p/><p>The value of PAC findings in distinguishing among the etiologies of PH are discussed in detail separately.

As an example, PA pressure may be elevated acutely by thromboembolism or hypoxemic-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction but may revert back to chronic levels or normal once the acute issue has resolved. Fluctuations in the PA pressure may be seen in irregular heart rhythms (eg, atrial fibrillation) because of variability in the diastolic filling time. </p><p>PA systolic pressure, like RV systolic pressure, rarely exceeds 40 to 50 mmHg in acute conditions (eg, pulmonary embolism) whereas severe elevations &gt;50 mmHg are classically due to chronic conditions such as PH. </p><p>The main components of the PA tracing are the systolic and diastolic pressures and the dicrotic notch, which represents closure of the pulmonic valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51162\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51162 \">figure 5</a>). The PA tracing is similar in appearance to the systemic arterial pressure tracing, except that the PA pressures are normally much lower. Detailed discussion of normal PA waveforms is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-techniques-normal-hemodynamics#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac catheterization techniques: Normal hemodynamics&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary artery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP] or pulmonary artery wedge pressure [PAWP]) estimates the left atrial pressure. It is best measured with the patient in the supine position, at the end of expiration with the tip of the catheter in zone 3 of the lung. Ideally, the value is measured at least three times and the mean is calculated. </p><p>The PAOP tracing is obtained by inflating the balloon at the distal tip of the catheter. The balloon obstructs blood flow through a branch of the pulmonary artery. This creates a static column of blood between the catheter tip and the left atrium. Pressure at both ends of the column equilibrates, after which the pressure at the distal end of the catheter is equal to the pressure of the left atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-interpretation-of-hemodynamic-values-and-waveforms-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, PAOP is a reflection of left atrial pressure. Normal wedge pressures vary from 6 to 15 mmHg, with a mean of 9 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70326 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Importantly, the PAOP usually estimates the left ventricular end-diastolic <strong>pressure</strong> (ie, left ventricular preload) if there is no obstruction to flow between the left atrium and left ventricle and the compliance of the left ventricle is normal. Importantly, it does <strong>not</strong> directly measure the left ventricular end-diastolic volume, capillary hydrostatic pressure, or transmural pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-interpretation-of-hemodynamic-values-and-waveforms-in-adults/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>].

Intrathoracic pressure (ie, alveolar and pleural pressure) changes with the respiratory cycle; it exerts pressure on the intravascular space within the lung, and consequently, affects PAOP, in a way that is dynamic throughout the respiratory cycle. Thus, during spontaneous breathing, pleural and alveolar pressures (relative to atmospheric pressure) decrease during inspiration and increase during expiration to similarly affect the PAOP. Conversely, during positive pressure ventilation, pleural and alveolar pressure increase during inspiration and decrease during expiration. However, at end-expiration, all intrathoracic pressures are equal to atmospheric pressure which allows the PAOP to be accurately measured regardless of whether the patient is spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated. </p><p>In the past, many ICU monitors measured PAOP by manually moving a cursor to end-expiration on the peak component of the pressure waveform which introduced error. However, many intensive care and cardiac catheterization units now use electronic pressure monitors that are designed to measure pressure in time intervals of four seconds and to display three different pressures: the systolic (peak), diastolic (trough), and mean pressure. The PAOP pressure can be followed serially on such monitors and measured at end expiration by selecting the systolic (peak) pressure for those breathing spontaneously (with positive intrathoracic pressure at end-expiration) and the diastolic pressure (trough) for those who are receiving positive pressure ventilation (with the intrathoracic positive pressure nadir at end-expiration) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62645\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62645 \">figure 8</a>).

The effects of PEEP on the PAOP are variable and depend largely upon the compliance of the lung, regardless of whether the PEEP was applied therapeutically (ie, applied or extrinsic PEEP) or the result of incomplete expiration and air trapping (ie, auto-PEEP or intrinsic PEEP).</p><p>However, in general, most experts consider the effects of PEEP as being clinically insignificant for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the catheter is properly positioned in zone 3, the airway pressure should not be transmitted to the vasculature. Respiratory variation of the PAOP waveform that is greater than respiratory variation of the pulmonary artery pressure waveform suggests that the catheter may not be in zone 3 and, therefore, the PAOP may be unreliable and should be repositioned (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62645\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62645 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-interpretation-of-hemodynamic-values-and-waveforms-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PAOP is the <strong>effective</strong> left atrial and ventricular filling pressure (ie, the intravascular pressure necessary to filling the left heart) that theoretically should not be affected by PEEP with a properly positioned catheter tip under zone 3 conditions.

As an example, for a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (decreased lung compliance) who is receiving an applied PEEP of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and has a PAOP of 12 mmHg, the recalculated PAOP would be 9.5 mmHg. This small difference indicates that the effects of PEEP on PAOP are usually small and, therefore, unlikely to affect clinical management.

Doing so may reduce the benefits of PEEP and induce hemodynamic instability due to changes in venous return and the arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>). It also will not accurately reflect the patient's hemodynamic status when PEEP is being used.

The causes of a low cardiac output include systolic and diastolic heart failure, but also include severe forms of mitral valve regurgitation, hypovolemia, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure.

In the case of thermodilution, the indicator is approximately 5 mL of either dextrose or saline that is cooler than blood. It is injected as a bolus through the proximal port of the PAC, where it mixes with blood in the right ventricle. The mixing lowers the temperature of intraventricular blood. As the blood flows past the distal thermistor port located in the tip of the catheter in the pulmonary artery, the thermistor records the temperature change over time and can electronically display a temperature-time curve. The area under this curve is inversely proportional to the flow rate in the pulmonary artery, which is determined by the cardiac output of the left ventricle. This flow rate is considered an estimate of cardiac output, assuming that there is no intracardiac shunt.</p><p>The thermodilution method has been well-validated, as compared with the calculation of cardiac output using the Fick method. However, there are several important sources of error of which clinicians should be aware:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricuspid regurgitation leads to an underestimation of CO. This is a consequence of the cold injectate refluxing back into the vena cava, with resultant decreased pulmonary artery cooling (attenuated peak) and delayed appearance of injectate that has moved retrograde into the vena cava and is then recirculated (prolonged washout). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right-to-left and left-to-right intracardiac shunts can produce falsely elevated cardiac output measurements by the thermodilution technique. Right-to-left intracardiac shunts produce shunting of cold injectate into the left heart, which reduces pulmonary artery cooling, attenuates the peak of the temperature-time curve, and overestimates cardiac output. Left-to-right intracardiac shunts produce increased right heart volumes and dilution of the injectate, which attenuates the height of the temperature-time curve and results in an overestimation of CO.</p><p/><p>Continuous thermodilution catheters are available and correlate well with bolus thermodilution methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-artery-catheterization-interpretation-of-hemodynamic-values-and-waveforms-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Severe elevations in RV pressure are generally associated with chronic conditions (eg, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension) while acute conditions rarely raise the RV systolic pressure above 40 mmHg (eg, acute pulmonary embolism). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Right ventricle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pulmonary artery</strong> &ndash; Normal pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressures range from 15 to 25 mmHg, while PA diastolic pressures range from 8 to 15 mmHg; the mean PA pressure (mPAp) is typically 16 mmHg (10 to 22 mmHg) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70326 \">table 2</a>). The mean PA pressure can be elevated (eg, mPAp, &gt;22 mmHg) by acute conditions (eg, venous thromboembolism or hypoxemic-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction) or acute-on-chronic conditions (eg, hypoxemic-induced vasoconstriction in a patient with underlying chronic cardiopulmonary disease). Additionally, chronic conditions including idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension [PH] due to left heart disease, chronic lung disease, chronic thromboembolism, and other miscellaneous causes can elevate the PA pressure; when the mPAp is &ge;25 mmHg, this is known as pulmonary arterial hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary artery'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and prognosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PAC can measure the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP]; pulmonary artery occlusion pressure). PAOP is best measured with the patient in the supine position, at the end of expiration with the tip of the catheter in zone 3 of the lung. Any condition that raises left ventricular end-diastolic pressure results in an elevated wedge pressure including left ventricular systolic heart failure, left ventricular diastolic heart failure, mitral and aortic valve disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; hypervolemia, right-to-left shunts, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive and restrictive cardiomyopathies. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Catheter waveforms and pressures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PAC measures the cardiac output (CO) via either the indicator thermodilution method or the Fick method. The preferred expression of CO is the cardiac index [CI], which is calculated by dividing the CO by the body surface area. Normal hemodynamic measures for CI are 2.8 to 4.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min/m<sup>2</sup></span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70326 \">table 2</a>). The causes of a low cardiac output include systolic and diastolic heart failure, but also include severe forms of mitral valve regurgitation, hypovolemia, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure. Distinguishing these pathologies from one another depends upon presenting clinical and echocardiographic features and well as specific patterns of physiologic variables seen on the PAC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F99516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99516 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F101388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101388 \">table 3</a>).

A step-up is defined as &gt;10 percent rise in oxygen saturation, when the saturation of blood in the RA, RV, or PA is compared to the calculated mixed venous oxygen saturation (taken from the SVC and IVC).
