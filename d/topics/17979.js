The prevalence of toxic nodular goiter increases with age and in the presence of iodine deficiency and may therefore be more common than Graves' disease in older populations in regions of iodine deficiency. Toxic adenoma and MNG are the result of focal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diffuse hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells whose functional capacity is independent of regulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Twenty to 80 percent of toxic adenomas and some nodules of MNGs have somatic mutations of the TSH receptor gene that confers autonomous hyperactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The treatment of toxic adenoma and MNG will be presented here.

For nonpregnant hyperthyroid patients with physical examination or ultrasound findings suggesting nodular thyroid disease, we obtain a radioactive iodine uptake scan as our initial test to distinguish toxic MNG and toxic adenoma from Graves' disease, or to assess the functionality of nodules, which may coexist with Graves' disease. Women of childbearing age who might be pregnant should have a negative pregnancy test prior to undergoing radioactive iodine scanning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism#H2638295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p>Radioactive iodine scanning is contraindicated during pregnancy. The diagnosis and evaluation of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A classic clinical presentation for toxic adenoma is a hyperthyroid patient with a palpable thyroid nodule that corresponds to an area of increased radioiodine concentration on thyroid scintigraphy; there should also be suppression of radioiodine uptake in surrounding and contralateral tissue if the TSH is subnormal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79487\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79487 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A classical clinical presentation for toxic MNG is a hyperthyroid patient with a palpable nodular goiter or a thyroid ultrasound showing multiple nodules. The nodularity may only be appreciated on ultrasound. On thyroid scintigraphy, there are typically one or more focal areas of increased radioiodine uptake, which may or may not correspond to the nodules. Nonfunctioning (&quot;cold&quot;) nodules are also present in some patients, and they should be evaluated in the same manner as a nonfunctioning solitary thyroid nodule, with the need for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) determined by nodule size and the presence of suspicious ultrasound characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70513\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70513 \">table 1</a>). The prevalence of thyroid cancer in a patient with MNG is 3 to 10 percent, although many of these are microcarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Periodic ultrasonography is also used to monitor nodule size accurately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to hyperthyroid symptoms and goiter, some patients with MNG have obstructive symptoms (cough, dysphagia, dyspnea). Because MNGs usually grow very slowly over many decades, obstructive symptoms almost always develop insidiously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-goiter-in-adults#H6514262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of goiter in adults&quot;, section on 'Obstructive symptoms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are two clinical situations in which establishing the diagnosis of a toxic adenoma or MNG is more difficult:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, the autonomously functioning tissue may be sufficiently diffuse that it is difficult to differentiate an MNG from Graves' disease by thyroid scintigraphy alone. When it is important to distinguish these disorders, a high serum concentration of thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) usually indicates Graves' disease; however, a low titer may not exclude the diagnosis in patients with very mild hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Determining the etiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, in iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, the exogenous iodine load can dilute the radioiodine tracer and result in both a low radioiodine uptake and a poor image on scintigraphy. Repeat scanning weeks or months later may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-induced-thyroid-dysfunction#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6587562\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with overt hyperthyroidism (low TSH with elevated free thyroxine [T4] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> triiodothyronine [T3]) due to toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter (MNG) require treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to treat when thyroid tests show subclinical hyperthyroidism (low serum TSH concentrations [&lt;0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/mL]</span> but normal serum free T4 and T3 concentrations) is based upon the risk for developing complications from subclinical hyperthyroidism (skeletal, cardiovascular) and the degree of TSH suppression. The management of patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;, section on 'Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with large goiters and symptoms of obstruction require treatment even if thyroid function is normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-obstructive-or-substernal-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of obstructive or substernal goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of hyperthyroidism due to toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter (MNG) consists of both symptomatic relief with beta blockers and decreasing the production of thyroid hormone with radioiodine ablation or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Prolonged thionamide therapy is an option for patients who would like to avoid both radioiodine and surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11616340\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockers ameliorate many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. They are often started as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made, even before obtaining a 24-hour radioiodine uptake or scan. In the absence of contraindications, we usually give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> (25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> which has the advantages of single-daily dosing and beta-1 selectivity, but all drugs of this class effectively reduce symptoms in patients with hyperthyroidism. Beta blockers may be tapered and discontinued after thyroid function tests have returned to normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11616346\"><span class=\"h2\">Decrease thyroid hormone synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery and radioiodine are the two most effective treatment options for permanently decreasing the production of thyroid hormone. Thionamides decrease thyroid hormone production but do not induce remission in hyperthyroidism secondary to nodular thyroid disease (ie, discontinuation results in recurrence of hyperthyroidism). Thionamides are often used to treat hyperthyroidism in patients with toxic adenoma or MNG in preparation for more definitive therapy with radioiodine or surgery. However, in patients with increased surgical risk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inability to comply with radiation safety guidelines, long-term treatment with thionamides is an option. In centers where ultrasound-guided percutaneous ethanol injection or interstitial laser photocoagulation are available, they are also options for patients who are not candidates for surgery or radioiodine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11616496\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with toxic adenoma or MNG, we suggest treatment with either surgery or radioiodine rather than prolonged thionamide therapy. In general, the choice between radioiodine and surgery is based upon individual patient factors and regional availability of expert thyroid surgeons. Our approach to management is consistent with the Hyperthyroidism Management Guidelines published by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prefer surgery for patients with very large goiters (&gt;80 g), symptoms or signs of <span class=\"nowrap\">compression/obstruction,</span> the need for rapid return to euthyroidism, and coexisting thyroid cancer. In the absence of one of these indications for surgery, either radioiodine or surgery may be preferred for definitive treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation safety regulations in some states and countries advise mothers receiving radioiodine to severely limit the time spent with their infants for up to five days. As a result, if suitable child care is unavailable, patients may opt to take thionamides for several years or may choose surgery over radioiodine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The individual patient's fears regarding radiation exposure, general anesthesia, or surgical complications often influence the decision, and some patients refuse both radioiodine and surgery. For them, prolonged thionamide therapy is acceptable as long as it is tolerated and the hyperthyroidism is controlled. Young women, however, need to be informed of the teratogenic effects of the thionamides. Percutaneous ethanol injection or laser therapy, where available, are alternatives to prolonged thionamide therapy.</p><p/><p>There are no randomized trials comparing radioiodine and surgery for the treatment of MNG or toxic adenoma. Both treatments resolve biochemical hyperthyroidism in most patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Surgery</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35571344\"><span class=\"h5\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is used more commonly for the treatment of patients with a toxic adenoma or MNG than it is for Graves' hyperthyroidism. It is indicated for patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive goiters or very large goiters</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coexisting malignancy or primary hyperparathyroidism</p><p/><p>Or patients who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need rapid and definitive correction of hyperthyroidism</p><p/><p>Surgery could also be considered in children and adolescents and may be preferable in patients with coexistent, nonfunctioning nodules, especially if the goiters are large.</p><p>In a retrospective series of 581 patients with MNG, 13 percent had symptoms of cervical compression (choking, dysphagia, dyspnea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The majority of the patients with compressive symptoms were treated with thyroidectomy rather than radioiodine. All of those who had thyroidectomy had reduction in gland size and compressive symptoms, compared with only 46 percent of those who were treated with radioiodine.</p><p>For rapid correction of hyperthyroidism, surgery is superior, as illustrated by the findings of a retrospective review of 362 patients with MNG treated with surgery (53 percent), radioiodine (45 percent), or both (2 percent) between 1990 and 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One month after treatment, resolution of hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 and 6 percent of patients treated with surgery and radioiodine, respectively. However, with longer-term follow-up (mean 28 months), resolution of hyperthyroidism occurred in 84 percent of patients receiving radioiodine (average time to achieve resolution of hyperthyroidism was 5.4 months). Reduction of goiter size was reported in 100 and 38 percent of patients treated with surgery and radioiodine, respectively, and recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and hypoparathyroidism each in 2 percent of patients treated with surgery. Thus, total or near-total thyroidectomy results in correction of goiter in almost all patients, whereas radioiodine reduces thyroid volume by approximately 38 to 45 percent. Permanent hypothyroidism is almost inevitable after thyroidectomy.</p><p>Surgery may be preferable in patients with large nodular goiters that include both autonomous and nonfunctioning nodules (as determined by scintigraphy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/3,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9-11</a>]. These patients have a substantial decrease in the size of the autonomous nodules after radioiodine treatment, but because uptake may be suppressed in nonautonomous tissue, they may not have a reduction in nonautonomous nodules to the extent seen during radioiodine treatment of patients with nontoxic MNG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-nontoxic-nonobstructive-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of nontoxic, nonobstructive goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, nodular thyroid tissue that remains following radioiodine treatment may develop calcifications over time, which may be interpreted as suspicious by radiologists on subsequent imaging and lead to thyroidectomy a decade or more after radioiodine treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35571350\"><span class=\"h5\">Extent of resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery for toxic adenoma and MNG should only be performed by surgeons with expertise in thyroid surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Preoperative iodine should not routinely be used in the preoperative preparation of patients with toxic adenoma and MNG owing to the increased risk of exacerbating hyperthyroidism, but rarely, iodine is used to help lower thyroid hormone levels in hyperthyroid patients who are already taking methimazole and who require urgent surgery (eg, severe hyperthyroidism or hyperthyroidism in the setting of myocardial infarction, stroke, or other severe comorbidity). Thionamides prevent the thyroid from using iodine as substrate for new hormone synthesis within two hours after the initial dose. Thus, thionamide therapy should therefore be started first and continued without interruption in divided doses because administration of iodine alone can exacerbate hyperthyroidism in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Preoperative preparation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be measured and repleted if low or given prophylactically.

We typically suggest radioiodine to patients who do not meet the surgical indications described above (see <a href=\"#H35571344\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above). Radioiodine can be given as primary therapy to patients with mild, well-tolerated hyperthyroidism. In comparison, patients who are more symptomatic, older, or have underlying heart disease are usually pretreated with a thionamide before radioiodine administration. (See <a href=\"#H6588023\" class=\"local\">'Thionamide administration'</a> below.)</p><p>Radioiodine is administered as an oral solution or capsule of sodium iodine 131 (131-I), which is rapidly concentrated in thyroid tissue. It induces extensive tissue damage, resulting in destruction of the adenoma or autonomous foci within 6 to 18 weeks. Radioiodine therapy not only ameliorates hyperthyroidism but also reduces the size of the adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. As an example, in a study of 62 patients treated with radioiodine for toxic adenoma, hyperthyroidism was controlled in all, usually in three months, and total thyroid volume decreased by 35 percent in three months and 45 percent in 24 months; five patients became hypothyroid during a three-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In patients with MNG, treatment with radioiodine cured hyperthyroidism in 92 to 98 percent of patients; some patients required two doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>].</p><p>Unlike Graves' disease, in which the goal of radioiodine therapy is destruction of the gland with eventual hypothyroidism, most patients are euthyroid after radioiodine therapy because the radioiodine preferentially accumulates in the hyperfunctioning nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In one series of 346 patients with toxic adenoma treated with 131-I, hypothyroidism was observed in 28, 46, and 60 percent of patients after 5, 10, and 20 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a series of 265 patients with MNG, 59 of whom were pretreated with antithyroid drugs, hypothyroidism was observed in 32, 55, and 73 percent of patients after three months, one year, and eight years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Higher rates of hypothyroidism are observed when patients are pretreated with antithyroid drugs. If the patient is pretreated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a>, radioiodine should ideally be given before the serum TSH concentration normalizes to prevent the accumulation of radioiodine into paranodular tissues, thereby minimizing the risk of hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H22055137\" class=\"local\">'Pretreament before radioiodine or surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients fail to reach a euthyroid state following the first dose of radioiodine and require a second or subsequent dose. These patients typically have severe hyperthyroidism or large goiters. Dosing of radioiodine is reviewed in more detail separately.

In order to avoid exposure of normal thyroid tissue to radioiodine (which increases the risk of hypothyroidism), the TSH should ideally still be below normal when radioiodine is administered. Methimazole can be restarted three to seven days after radioiodine is administered and stopped once radioiodine has proved to be effective.

Toxic adenomas may undergo hemorrhage or infarction, leaving a patient euthyroid, but this is rare. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism may be an exception because it can resolve in several months if the source of the iodine is discontinued. These patients can be treated with a thionamide alone.

Measurement of serum TSH alone can be misleading in the early follow-up period because it can remain low for weeks or even months, even when the patient is biochemically euthyroid or even hypothyroid, with serum free T4 values well within or even below the normal range. Thus, the principal tests used to follow the immediate effect of treatment of hyperthyroidism are the serum free T4 and total T3 concentration. Thyroid tests (TSH, free T4, total T3) should be measured six to eight weeks after treatment and then at four- to eight-week intervals thereafter, depending upon the results of prior testing and change in thyroid size. If thyroid hormone is required, the dose may be less than full replacement owing to persistent autonomous thyroid function. Once steady-state conditions are assured, measurement of TSH is required to assess the efficacy of therapy.

The decision to treat when thyroid tests show subclinical hyperthyroidism is based upon the risk for developing complications from subclinical hyperthyroidism (skeletal, cardiovascular) and the degree of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression.

Assuming there are no contraindications to its use, we prescribe a beta blocker to patients with moderate-to-severe hyperadrenergic symptoms until euthyroidism is achieved by thionamides, radioiodine, or surgery. We typically start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> 25 to 50 mg daily and increase the dose as needed (up to 200 mg daily) to reduce the pulse to less than 90 beats per minute (if blood pressure allows).

The individual patient's fears regarding radiation exposure, general anesthesia, or surgical complications often influence the decision, and some patients prefer to avoid both radioiodine and surgery. For them, prolonged thionamide therapy is acceptable as long as it is tolerated and the hyperthyroidism is controlled. Percutaneous ethanol injection or laser therapy, where available, are alternatives to prolonged thionamide therapy.

We discontinue methimazole three days prior to radioiodine. In order to avoid exposure of normal thyroid tissue to radioiodine (which increases the risk of hypothyroidism), the TSH should ideally still be below normal when radioiodine is administered. Methimazole can be restarted three to seven days after radioiodine is administered and stopped once radioiodine has proved to be effective.
