In particular, the isolation of bacteria from clinical samples yields information that can be used to guide the selection of appropriate antibiotic regimens based on knowledge of the most likely susceptibility profile of certain bacterial species. Through the use of <em>in vitro</em> antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the laboratory can specifically determine which antibiotics effectively inhibit the growth of a given bacterial isolate, allowing for targeted therapy. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern in both community and health care settings; as such, decisions surrounding empirical antibiotic treatment are becoming more complicated, and the importance of routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide therapeutic decisions has increased.</p><p>Multiple different methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing exist, including conventional methods, automated systems, and newer molecular techniques. Understanding these methods allows clinicians to correctly interpret susceptibility testing results reported by the clinical microbiology laboratory. In general, antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods used in clinical laboratories should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide rapid and accurate information to the clinician</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be relatively inexpensive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be relatively easy to perform</p><p/><p>This topic will provide an overview of antimicrobial susceptibility testing with a focus on bacterial isolates. Routine susceptibility testing of viruses and parasites is not performed in most clinical laboratories and is beyond the scope of this discussion. An overview of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in fungi is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antifungal-susceptibility-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antifungal susceptibility testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253793423\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC CONCEPTS OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H390011865\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrinsic versus acquired resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacteria can have either intrinsic or acquired resistance to antimicrobials. </p><p>Intrinsic resistance is inherent resistance to an antimicrobial that all or almost all members of a species display, rendering susceptibility testing unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> is intrinsically resistant to the antimicrobial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>. </p><p>In contrast, acquired resistance is the development of resistance to an antimicrobial to which members of the wild-type bacterial population are susceptible. Bacteria can acquire resistance through chromosomal mutations; through the horizontal transfer of genes via plasmids, integrons, transposons, or transformation; or through a combination of these mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Unlike intrinsic resistance, acquired resistance in a specific bacterial isolate is not reliably predictable. The goal of antimicrobial susceptibility testing is to determine the degree of acquired resistance to antibiotics that might be employed therapeutically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2798790166\"><span class=\"h2\">Constitutive versus inducible resistance mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expression of some bacterial resistance mechanisms is variable, potentially complicating their detection in the microbiology laboratory and requiring special consideration. </p><p>Constitutively expressed resistance mechanisms are expressed continuously, while inducible expression occurs following exposure to a particular inciting agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For example, use of third generation cephalosporins for infections caused by certain <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em> can induce production of a chromosomally encoded AmpC beta-lactamase,<em> </em>which results in resistance to this subgroup of beta-lactam antimicrobials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-lactam-antibiotics-mechanisms-of-action-and-resistance-and-adverse-effects#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta-lactam antibiotics: Mechanisms of action and resistance and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Chromosomal beta-lactamases'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1897544320\"><span class=\"h2\">Heteroresistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The phenotypic expression of an antimicrobial resistance mechanism within a bacterial population can be homogeneous or heterogeneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Heterogeneous expression, or heteroresistance, can lead to bacterial subpopulations within a microbiological sample that have varying degrees of phenotypic resistance, making the <em>in vitro</em> identification of resistance more difficult. Some conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods can be insufficiently sensitive for the identification of heteroresistance, leading to the misclassification of certain bacterial strains as susceptible. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods that use higher inocula can overcome this barrier, facilitating the detection of small subpopulations with intermediate or resistant minimum inhibitory concentrations. Heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>(hVISA) is an example of an organism with the capability of heterogenous expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2964915127\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed when clinically significant bacteria are isolated from patient specimens and the resulting information can be used to guide treatment. The microbiology laboratory is primarily responsible for making this determination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Susceptibility testing may not provide clinically useful information and thus may not be routinely performed in the following circumstances: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of a particular organism is predictable. As an example, testing <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> for susceptibility to penicillin is not routinely performed because isolates that are not susceptible to penicillin have not been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the isolated organism is likely to represent normal flora of the body site from which the specimen was collected (rather than a pathogen). As an example, <em>Lactobacillus </em>spp are considered part of the normal bacterial flora of the female genital tract, so their isolation in a vaginal culture would not trigger susceptibility testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When insufficient numbers of bacterial colonies are grown in culture of certain specimen types. As an example, organisms that grow in rare amounts in cultures of noninvasively collected urine specimens are likely to represent contamination and be of little clinical significance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the results of <em>in vitro</em> antimicrobial susceptibility testing do not reliably predict <em>in vivo </em>effectiveness or clinical therapeutic response. As an example, susceptibility testing of first and second generation cephalosporins against <em>Salmonella </em>and <em>Shigella </em>spp is not recommended due to the poor correlation between <em>in vitro </em>susceptibility testing results and clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When guidance regarding the performance of standardized susceptibility testing for a particular organism is not available from professional groups such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) or the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), or from regulatory authorities such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For certain infrequently isolated organisms (<em>Capnocytophaga </em>spp,<em> </em>for example), such guidance does not exist, making routine susceptibility testing and interpretation of these results difficult.</p><p/><p>Host factors also inform the decision to perform susceptibility testing. In particular, clinicians should notify the microbiology laboratory if a patient is immunosuppressed, so that it can modify the approach to selecting appropriate bacterial isolates for susceptibility testing. Some bacteria thought to be nonpathogenic in immunocompetent hosts can cause serious infections in immunocompromised individuals, and their isolation (particularly from a normally sterile site) may warrant antimicrobial susceptibility testing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623588753\"><span class=\"h1\">CONVENTIONAL METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods are phenotypic <em>in vitro</em> tests that provide a direct measurement of antimicrobial activity. These techniques measure the activity of a specific antimicrobial agent against a clinical bacterial isolate by assessing bacterial growth in the presence of that agent. Much of the antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed in clinical laboratories relies on these conventional methods because they provide accurate and reproducible results. However, these methods have several limitations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They rely on bacterial growth. This requirement is often the rate-limiting step and can make susceptibility testing of more fastidious bacteria, such as <em>Granulicatella </em>spp (formerly known as nutritionally variant streptococci),<em> </em>more difficult to perform. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) offers some guidance to microbiology laboratories on the testing of organisms that are fastidious or infrequently encountered in clinical practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114733\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114733 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standardization of the testing methods is necessary to ensure accuracy as well as intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility. This includes the selection of isolated colonies of the organism (taking care to avoid testing mixtures of different types of microorganisms), preparation of a standardized inoculum, and adherence to validated testing procedures. Performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing are available from CLSI and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1,7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are instances in which certain conventional testing methods are not recommended given their poor accuracy and reproducibility. As an example, disk diffusion is insensitive for the detection of vancomycin-intermediate <em>S. aureus</em>, and so this method should not be used when testing <em>S. aureus</em> isolates for susceptibility to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].</p><p/><p>Conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods can be categorized into those that provide qualitative results and those that provide quantitative results, as below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1111325202\"><span class=\"h2\">Qualitative methods (disk diffusion/Kirby-Bauer method)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, qualitative conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods tend to be easier to perform and interpret compared with quantitative methods. They classify the activity of an antimicrobial agent against a specific organism into one of three interpretive categories (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant (see <a href=\"#H556591212\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of results'</a> below)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. The qualitative conventional testing method most commonly used by clinical microbiology laboratories is the disk diffusion, or Kirby-Bauer, method, due to its simplicity, reliability, and high degree of standardization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1387906758\"><span class=\"h3\">Performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In brief, the procedure involves swabbing a standardized inoculum of bacteria (approximately 1 to 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> colony-forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">[CFU]/mL)</span> onto a Mueller-Hinton (or other medium appropriate for the bacterial species) agar plate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Commercially prepared paper disks, each embedded with a fixed concentration of a specific antimicrobial, are placed on the agar surface. During overnight incubation, the antimicrobials diffuse into the agar medium, creating a concentration gradient as each antimicrobial diffuses further away from the disk. Bacterial growth is inhibited at sites where the concentration of an antimicrobial is high enough to prevent proliferation of the organism. After incubation, the diameters of the complete growth inhibition zones around each disk are measured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79261\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79261 \">picture 1</a>). Pre-specified breakpoints are used to interpret the zone sizes and classify them as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant. (See <a href=\"#H556591212\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of results'</a> below.)</p><p>The diameter of the zone of inhibition is affected by both the susceptibility of the organism to a specific antibiotic and by the rate at which the drug diffuses into the agar medium. Overall, there is a correlation between the size of the zone of inhibition and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), but this relationship is not always linear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; as a result, simply measuring the zone of inhibition without knowledge of the breakpoints should not be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3314202072\"><span class=\"h3\">Advantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disk diffusion method is considered to be a reference method for many organism-antimicrobial combinations. In addition to its low cost and simplicity, an advantage of disk diffusion is the flexibility in the choice of tested antimicrobials; this choice can be customized in accordance with institutional formularies and local resistance patterns and can be modified easily when indicated. The qualitative results of disk diffusion testing (ie, susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) are also readily interpreted by clinicians.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2524354178\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the numerous advantages of the disk diffusion method, there are also some important limitations. The lack of automation of the procedure makes its use in high-volume microbiology laboratories more difficult. </p><p>Furthermore, though this method is validated for most commonly encountered bacteria, its use with some more fastidious or slow-growing bacteria has not been as well studied or standardized. As an example, disk diffusion testing of HACEK group bacteria, such as <em>Aggregatibacter </em>spp,<em> Cardiobacterium </em>spp,<em> Eikenella corrodens, </em>and <em>Kingella </em>spp, is not recommended by CLSI for this reason [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Finally, there are some circumstances in which the qualitative nature of disk diffusion susceptibility results is a limitation; for certain infections, a quantitative MIC is required to determine the best therapeutic approach. For example, recommended treatment regimens for endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci are stratified by the penicillin MIC, necessitating the use of a quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3356834294\"><span class=\"h2\">Quantitative methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitative methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing allow determination of the MIC, which is the lowest concentration of a specific agent that is needed to inhibit visible growth of an organism. Breakpoints published by the CLSI, EUCAST, or, in the United States, within Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antimicrobial drug package inserts, are used to classify MICs into susceptible, intermediate, or resistant interpretive categories. </p><p>Quantitative techniques are considered to be the most precise for the comparison of <em>in vitro </em>efficacy of different antibiotics against a specific organism. Furthermore, as noted above, there are certain infections for which a quantitative result is required in order to optimize the antimicrobial treatment regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Several quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility methods are currently available, including agar dilution, broth dilution (macrodilution and microdilution), and gradient methods, as detailed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3592483893\"><span class=\"h3\">Agar dilution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The agar dilution method is a well-studied and reproducible technique that is considered a reference standard for the susceptibility testing of many organism-antimicrobial combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1,7,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,9,10</a>]. However, because of the high cost and labor intensive nature of the method, the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories restrict its use to certain specific applications, such as screening for high-level <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> resistance in enterococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This technique is also recommended for use with fastidious bacteria that require special growth conditions, such as <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>With this method, a fixed concentration of a specific antimicrobial is added into molten agar and allowed to solidify [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Agar plates containing serial twofold dilutions of the antimicrobial are created, with concentrations spanning the relevant range for testing the organism of interest. As many as 36 different bacterial isolates can be tested on a single agar plate in locations called spots, with a standardized inoculum (approximately 10<sup>4</sup> CFU) of an isolate inoculated onto a particular spot. Plates are incubated for 16 to 20 hours and subsequently examined for growth. The plate with the lowest antimicrobial concentration that visibly inhibits bacterial growth is designated as the MIC. (See <a href=\"#H556591212\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of results'</a> below.)</p><p>A principle advantage of the agar dilution method is that MICs can be generated without using any special laboratory instrumentation. </p><p>As above, the main limitations of the agar dilution method are the high cost of reagents and the labor required to prepare the agar plates, which are generally not commercially available and which cannot be batch-produced and stored for future use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265435726\"><span class=\"h3\">Broth dilution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Broth dilution is performed by creating a series of twofold dilutions of a specific antimicrobial, including concentrations that cover the breakpoints for the organism of interest, and determining the lowest concentration of antimicrobial that inhibits growth (under standardized incubation conditions) of the bacterial isolate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This concentration is the MIC. The principles of the broth dilution technique apply to both broth macrodilution and broth microdilution methods. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249937059\"><span class=\"h4\">Broth (tube) macrodilution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The broth macrodilution method is mainly reserved for research settings, such as evaluation of new antimicrobial compounds. </p><p>In the broth macrodilution procedure, serial antimicrobial dilutions are manually prepared in tubes containing 1 to 2 mL of broth medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. Each tube is inoculated with an equal volume of a standardized bacterial suspension (containing approximately 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL)</span>. After overnight incubation, the tubes are visually inspected for the presence of turbidity, which is an indicator of bacterial growth. The tube with the lowest concentration of the specific antimicrobial in which turbidity is absent is the MIC (see <a href=\"#H556591212\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of results'</a> below). The precision of the broth macrodilution method is considered to be plus or minus one twofold dilution.</p><p>Broth macrodilution is a time-honored technique that has been well studied and standardized, making it a reliable tool for the detection of antimicrobial resistance. However, limitations include its lack of automation, making it particularly labor intensive and subject to error introduced during the manual preparation of the antibiotic dilutions. As a result, this method is not used for routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing in clinical microbiology laboratories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H568549474\"><span class=\"h4\">Broth microdilution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The broth microdilution method is a popular method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing in clinical microbiology laboratories. </p><p>It is considered a miniaturized and more automated version of the macrodilution method (see <a href=\"#H249937059\" class=\"local\">'Broth (tube) macrodilution'</a> above). It employs the same principles as the macrodilution procedure, but the antibiotic dilutions are prepared in small volumes of broth medium (usually 0.1 mL per well) in 96-well plates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F78681\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78681 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Panels containing dilutions of commonly used antibiotics are commercially available (frozen or lyophilized), which saves labor and reduces the risk of error associated with preparing dilutions within the clinical laboratory. A standardized inoculum of bacteria (approximately 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL)</span> is added into each well and the plates are incubated for 16 to 20 hours. After incubation, the wells can be examined either manually or through an automated tray reader for the presence of turbidity. As with the macrodilution method, the concentration of antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth is defined as the MIC. (See <a href=\"#H556591212\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of results'</a> below.)</p><p>Like disk diffusion and agar dilution, broth microdilution testing is considered to be a reference method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The results of broth microdilution testing are generally reproducible, and the 96-well plate format facilitates the concurrent testing of multiple antimicrobials within a relatively small footprint. Test panels are commercially available, and some such panels allow for simultaneous organism identification. As an additional advantage, broth microdilution can also be used for the susceptibility testing of many fastidious bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Disadvantages include its high cost relative to some other methods, such as disk diffusion. Additionally, when using commercial test panels, the included antibiotics may not be well matched to an institution's formulary. Furthermore, because of the miniaturization of the microdilution method, one logarithm fewer bacteria are analyzed than with the macrodilution method; therefore, resistance mechanisms present in only a small subset of a bacterial population might not be represented within the tested inoculum, and the organism might falsely appear to be uniformly susceptible to a drug. (See <a href=\"#H1897544320\" class=\"local\">'Heteroresistance'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3576844999\"><span class=\"h3\">Antimicrobial gradient method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antimicrobial gradient method is an agar-based technique that relies on the creation of a concentration gradient of an antimicrobial to determine the susceptibility of a bacterial isolate to the antimicrobial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59934\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59934 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p>As with the disk diffusion method, the gradient procedure involves the preparation of a standardized bacterial suspension containing approximately 1 to 2 x 10<sup>8 </sup><span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> organisms and streaking it onto a Mueller-Hinton (or other medium appropriate for the bacterial species) agar plate. Commercially produced plastic strips, each impregnated with a graded concentration of a specific antimicrobial, are then placed on the inoculated plate. After overnight incubation, the MIC of each antimicrobial is determined by identifying the intersection of the elliptical zone of growth inhibition with the antimicrobial gradient on the strip.</p><p>Multiple reports have confirmed that results of gradient method testing correlate well with those of agar dilution and broth dilution for certain organism-antimicrobial combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. However, the gradient method should only be used for testing organism-antimicrobial combinations approved by the FDA or demonstrated in well-controlled studies to be equivalent in performance to CLSI reference methods, since the method is not robust for all applications; for example, the method may overstate the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> MIC for <em>S. aureus</em> by one or more doubling dilutions.</p><p>One strength of the gradient technique is that it can be used to test fastidious organisms with special growth requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Because each antimicrobial is tested individually (and not as part of a predetermined panel), the gradient method also allows for flexibility in the selection of which antimicrobials to test for a specific isolate. </p><p>Important limitations of the gradient method are its cost and lack of automation, both of which preclude its use for testing numerous antimicrobials against routine isolates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556591212\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional qualitative disk diffusion and quantitative susceptibility testing methods yield an inhibitory zone diameter and an MIC, respectively, for the given isolate-antibiotic pair. Breakpoints published by the CLSI, EUCAST, or, in the United States, within FDA-approved antimicrobial drug package inserts, are used to interpret the zone sizes or MIC values and classify them into one of the following categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Susceptible &ndash; Indicates that the antibiotic concentration that inhibits the isolate's growth is usually achieved with administration of the dose recommended for the type of infection and infecting organism.

Clinical efficacy can be achieved when the antimicrobial is physiologically concentrated at the site of infection (eg, fluoroquinolones in the urine) or when higher than normal doses can be safely administered (eg, beta-lactams).

Because these optical systems can detect more subtle changes in growth than would be visible to the human eye, they can determine antimicrobial susceptibility patterns more rapidly than conventional methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Multiple such automated systems are available; all use similar techniques and involve inoculation of antimicrobial microdilution trays or small cards with known quantities of bacteria, followed by incubation in an instrument that monitors growth in each well using photometric, fluorometric, or turbidimetric measurements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79132\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79132 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Using these automated systems, multiple antimicrobials can be tested against a specific isolate at a time, and many samples can be processed simultaneously.</p><p>The software of automated systems also offers certain advantages. It can include interpretive rules (which can be customized in some cases) to facilitate detection of unusual or important susceptibility patterns that warrant particular action, such as confirmation before reporting or expedited notification of clinicians or infection control personnel. Additionally, these automated systems can interface with the electronic medical record to quickly make results available to clinicians, which has been associated with improvements in clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>The principal limitation of automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems is cost, which is prohibitive for some clinical microbiology laboratories. Earlier automated systems also had difficulty detecting inducible antimicrobial resistance patterns, such as those seen with certain beta-lactamases; newer versions, however, have improved the ability to detect these specific resistance mechanisms, making them reliable tools for routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing of many commonly isolated bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There can be a lag between the publication of new interpretive criteria by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the incorporation of the new breakpoints into the database of an automated system. In this setting, clinical microbiology laboratories must be aware of these discrepancies and perform validation studies to assure adequate performance of the automated system with the revised breakpoints before adopting them.</p><p>In the United States, FDA clearance of an automated system indicates that it provides results that are substantially equivalent to those generated using appropriate reference methods (eg, broth microdilution, agar dilution) for the organisms and antimicrobial agents claimed in the manufacturer's package insert [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82584653\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS TO DETECT SPECIFIC TYPES OF RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment regimens can often be devised on the basis of qualitative or quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing results for a given clinical isolate without knowledge of the specific acquired resistance mechanism or mechanisms present. Determination of specific resistance mechanisms (eg, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production or carbapenemase production among <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>) is more commonly useful for infection control and epidemiologic purposes. However, there are some situations in which knowing that an isolate expresses a specific resistance mechanism can be clinically valuable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4153378657\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta-lactamase testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The beta-lactamases produced by many commonly encountered bacteria, including <em>Staphylococcus </em>spp, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, and <em>Enterococcus </em>spp, can be detected in the clinical microbiology laboratory. These enzymes confer resistance to penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> through hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring<em>.</em> In many cases, this enzymatic hydrolysis can be ascertained within minutes from colony growth (in contrast to the overnight incubation required by growth-dependent disk diffusion or minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] tests), providing rapid information that can guide antimicrobial selection. In other cases, supplemental beta-lactamase testing should be performed to confirm the results of routine disk diffusion or dilution MIC testing before reporting results; for example, <em>Staphylococcus </em>spp<em> </em>that initially test susceptible to penicillin should only be reported as penicillin-susceptible if the results of beta-lactamase testing are negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The chromogenic cephalosporin beta-lactamase method can be used to detect beta-lactamases in staphylococci, <em>H. influenzae</em>, <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, <em>Enterococcus</em> spp, and other bacteria. It is performed by placing a small amount of test organism onto a commercially prepared paper disk embedded with nitrocefin, a chromogenic cephalosporin. If the test organism produces a beta-lactamase that hydrolyzes nitrocefin's beta-lactam ring, a pink color is produced (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114730\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114730 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some organisms, such as <em>H. influenzae</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, produce beta-lactamase constitutively. In contrast, staphylococci may produce detectable levels of beta-lactamase only after exposure to an inducing agent; therefore the inoculum of staphylococci used for the chromogenic cephalosporin beta-lactamase test should be taken from growth in the zone margin surrounding a penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> disk. </p><p>For <em>S. aureus</em>, the penicillin zone edge test, or the &quot;beach and cliff,&quot; test can also be used to detect beta-lactamases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this procedure, a standard inoculum of the organism is plated onto a Mueller-Hinton agar plate. A commercially available penicillin disk is added to the agar plate, which is then incubated for 16 to 18 hours. After incubation, the zone edge of inhibition of growth around the penicillin disk is examined. A sharp zone edge (a &quot;cliff&quot;) indicates the presence of a beta-lactamase, while a fuzzy zone edge (a &quot;beach&quot;) indicates the absence of a beta-lactamase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114731\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114731 \">picture 6</a>).

Techniques commonly used to detect bacterial nucleic acid sequences conferring antibiotic resistance include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA hybridization. A number of such genotypic assays have been cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], in some cases as screening tools for the identification of multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospital settings, and in others for diagnostic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>].

Some molecular assays can be performed directly on clinical specimens or primary cultures, in contrast to conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods that require initial bacterial growth, subculture, and pure colony isolation, resulting in substantially faster turnaround times. Furthermore, some molecular assays are more automated, objective, and simple to perform than conventional methods, which can reduce both labor and errors. Additionally, when a given phenotypic resistance pattern can occur as a consequence of more than one genetic determinant, molecular tests can provide more specific information about the presence of particular resistance genes that are of institutional epidemiological or infection control concern.</p><p>Molecular antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods also have important limitations that have thus far restricted their clinical application:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available FDA-cleared assays are designed to identify one or a few specific genetic resistance targets in a given bacterial species. This can be sufficient when antimicrobial resistance is mediated by one or two specific genes, as with the <em>mecA </em>gene, which regulates the vast majority of methicillin resistance in human isolates of <em>S. aureus</em>. For many other bacteria, however, the genetic underpinnings of antimicrobial resistance are much more complex, and reliance on molecular assays that target only a few known resistance genes to predict antimicrobial susceptibility would be misleading. This caveat is especially relevant among members of the family <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>,<em> </em>in which hundreds of resistance mechanisms have been described. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genotypic results do not obviate the need for phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing. While FDA-cleared molecular assays have good sensitivity and specificity for the detection of specific genetic resistance elements, phenotypic testing is still required to confirm those results and to provide information about other possible therapeutic options. As an example, a clinician treating a patient with an infection caused by methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> may not only need to know that the isolate is resistant to methicillin, but also whether the isolate is susceptible to other antimicrobials. Because molecular testing is performed in addition to (rather than in replacement of) phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing, its use has the potential to increase both costs and labor in clinical microbiology laboratories. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The detection of a specific genetic resistance target is not always associated with the expression of this gene <em>in vivo</em>. In some circumstances, characterizing bacteria as resistant based on unexpressed genetic potential may result in over-reporting of resistance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of genotypic tests are significantly more expensive than phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility tests and do not allow for high-throughput testing, both of which are important considerations in laboratories responsible for a large volume of clinical testing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3628488622\"><span class=\"h1\">REPORTING SUSCEPTIBILITY RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of antimicrobials to use for susceptibility testing on a given isolate depends on several factors, including the type of organism, the site of infection, and the institutional formulary. </p><p>The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute provides guidance regarding the selection of appropriate antimicrobial agents for testing commonly encountered bacteria, as well as many infrequently isolated organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. These recommendations are based on clinical data when available, United States Food and Drug Administration clinical indications for use, consensus recommendations, known resistance patterns, and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-antibacterial-susceptibility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Once antimicrobial susceptibility testing is complete, the clinical microbiology laboratory also must decide which results should be released into the clinical information system. A committee comprised of microbiologists, infectious diseases physicians, and pharmacists is often responsible for selecting the number and types of antimicrobials that should be reported for an individual organism under specific circumstances. The rationale for selective reporting is to help guide antimicrobial prescribing and reduce the inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials when more targeted agents would suffice. As an example, a laboratory might test <em>S. pyogenes</em> isolates for susceptibility to carbapenems, but it would be inappropriate to routinely prescribe such broad-spectrum agents to treat infections caused by this pathogen, and so the carbapenem susceptibility results should generally be suppressed from reporting into the clinical information system.</p><p>Results that are not routinely reported should be released to the clinicians under specific circumstances, as in cases of unexpected resistance or multidrug resistance (in which case, the susceptibility testing results for broader spectrum or second-line agents may be needed to guide the regimen selection). Direct communication between clinicians and clinical microbiology laboratory personnel is frequently helpful in such scenarios to establish whether additional testing should be undertaken. The clinical microbiology laboratory should save isolates from cultures for at least one week after the culture is reported as final in the event that additional testing is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85969693\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed when clinically significant bacteria are isolated from patient specimens and the resulting information can be used to guide treatment.
