Radiologic detection of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in vivo by fluoroscopy was described in the late 1950s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and an association between the presence of CAC and the risk of cardiovascular events was subsequently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the diagnostic and prognostic use of CAC. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is discussed separately.

The most widely used and best-established measure of CAC for assessment of the diagnostic and prognostic value of EBCT CAC scanning is the Agatston score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other measures, such as the volume score and calcium mass have been less well studied.</p><p>Since 1999, the temporal resolution of multidetector row or multislice CT scanners (MDCT or MSCT) has improved sufficiently to permit imaging of the beating heart with no or little motion artifact. The early studies examining the diagnostic and prognostic value of CAC scanning that are discussed below have been conducted with EBCT. However, EBCT is now essentially obsolete. 64-detector MDCT is considered state-of-the-art and most newer studies of CAC have been performed with this technology. One study demonstrated that CAC scores using both volume score and Agatston score were equivalent between EBT and 64-detector MDCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The software used to analyze CAC has been shown to generate some variability. However, intra- and inter-scan agreement of CAC measured on the same MDCT scanner is quite high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Methods for measuring CAC from contrast-enhanced CT angiograms have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, non-contrast scans remain the standard for making these measurements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">CAC scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CAC scanning by MDCT may be marketed directly to the consumer and may be available without physician referral. As a result, many asymptomatic individuals undergo CAC scanning and then present to their health care providers for a discussion of their normal or abnormal test results.</p><p>Coronary CT angiography using multidetector CT scanners has also been marketed to the consumer and has led to decreased use of isolated CAC scanning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive coronary imaging with cardiac computed tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance&quot;, section on 'Coronary CT angiography'</a>.) </p><p>CAC scoring was not initially accepted as a screening tool for asymptomatic patients within the cardiovascular community. However, the 2010 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines on screening for coronary artery disease indicated that measurement of CAC is reasonable (level of evidence B) for cardiovascular risk assessment in asymptomatic adults at Framingham intermediate risk (10 to 20 percent 10-year risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The guidelines noted that measurement of CAC &quot;may be reasonable&quot; for patients at low to intermediate risk (6 to 10 percent 10-year risk). It was not recommended for patients at low (&lt;6 percent, 10-year risk) or high risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The data addressing the diagnostic and prognostic implications of CAC scanning will be reviewed here. The use of MDCT and other modalities for noninvasive coronary angiography are discussed separately.

A typical dose is 1 to 2 mSv. A study suggested that CAC scoring using a tube voltage of 100 kVp rather than 120 kVp gives the equivalent imaging result with a lower radiation dose (1.17 versus 1.70 mSv) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Most of the clinical studies that examined the relationship between CAC and coronary artery stenoses have been performed in patients with chest pain who were referred for x-ray coronary angiography. Other studies evaluated coronary artery specimens obtained at autopsy. Of note, percentage coronary artery stenosis is an imperfect measure of the physiologic severity of coronary disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coronary-artery-pressure-flow-measurements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Direct relationships have been established between CAC scores and histologic, intracoronary ultrasonic, and angiographic measures of coronary artery atherosclerosis and plaque burden on a vessel-by-vessel and segment-by-segment basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. However, non-contrast MDCT has a low sensitivity for detecting plaques without appreciable calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and in one study, the cross-sectional plaque area found on histologic examination was approximately five times greater than the calcification area measured by EBCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Because of vascular remodeling, there is a compensatory enlargement of arteries in early atherosclerosis that serves to accommodate the growing plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As a result, extensive CAC may be present before the plaque burden overwhelms vascular remodeling, begins to encroach upon the vessel lumen, and leads to clinically relevant stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">CAC scoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In both men and women, CAC detected by CT is highly sensitive for the presence of &ge;50 percent angiographic stenosis but only moderately specific, especially in individuals over 60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/11-13,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13,15-17</a>]. In a review of 16 studies, the sensitivity and specificity of EBCT were 91 and 49 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>However, the absence of CAC is highly predictive of the absence of significant (greater than 50 percent) coronary artery stenosis. In three series, patients with no CAC had a probability of significant coronary stenosis of less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The frequency of converting to a positive CAC score from 0 over a mean of 4.1&plusmn;0.9 years in a study of 422 individuals was 25 percent and was associated with age, diabetes, and cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The highest rate of conversion was in the fifth year as the rate of conversion was nonlinear.</p><p>In a number of studies, the following definitions have been used to relate the CAC score and coronary plaque burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 &ndash; No identifiable disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1 to 99 &ndash; Mild disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>100 to 399 &ndash; Moderate disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;400 &ndash; Severe disease</p><p/><p>Both sensitivity and specificity for the presence of &ge;50 percent angiographic stenosis vary with the amount of CAC; with more marked CAC, sensitivity falls but specificity increases.

The importance of age and gender was illustrated in a review of 1764 patients in which EBCT was compared with x-ray coronary angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Effect on prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The magnitude of differences in prevalence and extent of CAC among ethnic groups was illustrated in reports from the population-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) of 6814 men and women (mean age 63 years) in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The participants had no clinical cardiovascular disease and treated diabetic patients were excluded.

Silent (asymptomatic) myocardial ischemia is the most common manifestation of coronary heart disease (CHD), accounting for more than 75 percent of ischemic episodes during daily life. Most silent ischemic episodes occur during minimal or no physical exertion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Silent myocardial ischemia: Epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a>). Conversely, because CAC is very prevalent, particularly with increasing age and in men, many patients with CAC do not have ischemia.</p><p>The relationship between silent ischemia, detected by stress testing, and CAC has been evaluated in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/22,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31-33</a>].

Among the 76 patients with stress-induced ischemia, the CAC score was &gt;0 in 95 percent, &ge;100 in 88 percent, and &ge;400 in 68 percent. Not surprisingly, CAC was also present, although less prevalent, in patients without stress-induced ischemia; the respective values were 78, 56, and 31 percent. The frequency of ischemia on radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging was less than 2 percent overall in patients with CAC scores &lt;100.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a study of 411 patients who had an exercise stress test with rMPI within a close time period of EBCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although most subjects (78 percent) with CAC on EBCT did <em>not</em> have inducible ischemia with exercise testing, the likelihood of ischemia increased with CAC score, regardless of age or sex. No subject with a score &lt;10 had ischemia, while ischemia was present in 2.6 percent of those with a score of 11 to 100, 11.3 percent with a score of 101 to 399, and 46 percent of those with a score &ge;400.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher risk population was evaluated in a review of 260 apparently healthy, asymptomatic middle-aged siblings (mean age 51) of hospitalized patients with premature CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
