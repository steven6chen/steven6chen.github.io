The first benzodiazepine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlordiazepoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlordiazepoxide</a>, was discovered serendipitously in 1954 by the Austrian scientist Leo Sternbach. Three years later, it was marketed as a therapeutic medication under the brand name Librium. Following chlordiazepoxide in 1963, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> was released followed by multiple other compounds over subsequent years.</p><p>BZDs are used for sedation and to treat anxiety, seizures, withdrawal states, insomnia, and drug-associated agitation. They are frequently combined with other medications for procedural sedation. Due to their many uses, BZDs are widely prescribed and nearly 50 different agents are available worldwide. The high incidence of BZD overdose mirrors their widespread use and availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis and management of acute benzodiazepine poisoning will be reviewed here. A general approach to the poisoned patient and the management of poisonings involving other agents with sedative properties are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethanol-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethanol intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines (BZD) are organic bases with a benzene ring and a seven member diazepine moiety; various side chains determine the potency, duration of action, metabolite activity, and rate of elimination for specific agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. BZDs exert their effect via modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptor. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system.</p><p>The GABA-A receptor is composed of five subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) arranged in various combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. The composition of subunits determines the affinity of the various xenobiotics that bind to the receptor. Benzodiazepines bind at the interface of the alpha and gamma subunits and, once bound, lock the GABA-A receptor into a conformation that increases its affinity for GABA. BZDs do not alter the synthesis, release, or metabolism of GABA but rather potentiate its inhibitory actions by augmenting receptor binding. This binding increases the flow of chloride ions through the GABA ion channel, causing postsynaptic hyperpolarization and a decreased ability to initiate an action potential. The low incidence of respiratory depression with orally ingested BZDs appears to be related to the low density of binding sites in the brainstem respiratory center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines are commonly divided into three groups based upon half-life duration: short-acting (half-life of less than 12 hours), intermediate-acting (half-life between 12 and 24 hours), and long-acting (half-life greater than 24 hours). A table describing the kinetics of common BZDs is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69184\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69184 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Short-acting benzodiazepines generally have few active metabolites, do not accumulate with repeated doses, and demonstrate clearance that is largely unaffected by age and liver disease. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triazolam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a>. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> possesses a short half-life, it has active metabolites that can accumulate with repeated dosing.</p><p>Intermediate-acting benzodiazepines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temazepam</a>. Long-acting benzodiazepines generally have pharmacologically active metabolites, accumulate in tissues after multiple doses, and demonstrate impaired clearance in older patients and those with liver disease. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlordiazepoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlordiazepoxide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>BZDs are rapidly absorbed in the GI tract and most are highly lipophilic and highly protein bound. The metabolism of BZDs is primarily hepatic. Within the liver, most BZDs are metabolized to a significant extent by the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Alprazolam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> are metabolized by CYP3A4. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diazepam</a> is metabolized by both CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.</p><p>Interactions with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP enzymes may prolong the half-lives of certain BZDs, leading to prolonged clinical effects and therapeutic misadventures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Examples of drugs that inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme and reduce the metabolism of BZDs thereby prolonging their effects, include macrolide antibiotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, HIV protease inhibitors, and grapefruit juice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 2</a>).

However, successive doses of midazolam lead to bioaccumulation of its hydroxy-metabolites and may prolong the drug's sedative effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The classic presentation of a patient with an isolated BZD overdose consists of CNS depression with normal vital signs. Many patients are arousable and able to provide an adequate history. Of note, most intentional ingestions of BZDs involve a coingestant, the most common being ethanol.</p><p>Patients with a clinically apparent ingestion manifest slurred speech, ataxia, and altered (most commonly depressed) mental status. Respiratory compromise is uncommon with isolated oral ingestions, but may be seen when patients ingest additional sedative hypnotic agents (such as ethanol) or when clinicians administer BZDs as one of several agents for procedural sedation. The latter scenario more often leads to respiratory depression due to the intravenous administration of BZDs and the consequent rapid rise in central nervous system concentrations.</p><p>The doses required to produce respiratory compromise are difficult to quantify and depend upon many factors, including tolerance, weight, age, coingestants, and genetics.</p><p>Patients with severe toxicity can present stuporous or comatose. One observational study found <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a> to be the least and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temazepam</a> the most sedating BZD in intentional overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The authors speculate that this is because temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam more slowly absorbed than other BZDs. Another observational study found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> overdose resulted in significantly longer hospital stays, higher ICU admission rates, and a greater need for mechanical ventilation and the use of reversal agents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The potential effects of PG toxicity include skin and soft tissue necrosis (from extravasation), hemolysis, cardiac dysrhythmias, hypotension, lactic acidosis, seizure, coma, and multisystem organ failure.</p><p>PG toxicity is rare but may be considered when patients receiving large or continuous infusions of parenteral BZDs (eg, mechanical ventilation, severe sedative hypnotic or ethanol withdrawal syndromes, undifferentiated agitated delirium, management of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> overdose) develop an anion gap metabolic acidosis. The osmolal gap correlates with PG concentrations and can be used as a surrogate marker of PG toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Endotracheal intubation should not be delayed if needed. Oxygen is administered, intravenous access established, and continuous cardiac monitoring employed. A fingerstick serum glucose is immediately obtained. End tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ie, capnography) can be useful for monitoring patients at risk for hypoventilation, as can occur with severe benzodiazepine overdose.

However, the use of flumazenil in the setting of overdose remains highly controversial.

The maximum dose should NOT exceed 1 mg total or 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> the lower dose is preferable.</p><p>The peak effect of a single <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a> dose occurs approximately 6 to 10 minutes after IV administration. For patients at greater risk of seizure or agitation with BZD reversal, a longer wait of several minutes between subsequent doses may be warranted.</p><p>The duration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a> is short (0.7 to 1.3 hours) and the duration of effect of a long-acting BZD or a large BZD dose can exceed that of flumazenil. Resedation may be treated in adults by using 0.2 mg doses (maximum total dose 1 mg) until the desired effect is achieved. For patients with exposures to BZDs with prolonged durations of action or those with hepatic insufficiency with prolonged exposure to BZDs, a continuous flumazenil infusion (0.25 to 1 mg per hour) may be needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Again, we suggest consultation with a medical toxicologist or poison control center whenever a flumazenil infusion is thought to be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Disposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who require mechanical ventilation or have been exposed to a dangerous coingestant are admitted to a critical care setting.</p><p>Most patients with an isolated BZD ingestion can be safely discharged or transferred for psychiatric evaluation following an observation period of four to six hours, provided that any concerning symptoms, such as CNS depression, have resolved. The patient should be able to ambulate safely by the end of this period. Patients with persistent signs of intoxication beyond six hours should be admitted to a monitored setting until symptoms resolve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">WITHDRAWAL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism, signs, and prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any abrupt or overly rapid reduction in benzodiazepine (BZD) dose among chronic users can produce withdrawal. Rapid recognition and treatment of BZD withdrawal is crucial because the syndrome can be life-threatening. The symptoms and signs of BZD withdrawal can include tremors, anxiety, perceptual disturbances, dysphoria, psychosis, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The onset of withdrawal varies according to the half-life of the BZD involved. Symptoms may be delayed up to three weeks in BZDs with long half-lives, but may appear as early as 24 to 48 hours after cessation of BZDs with short half-lives. The severity and duration of withdrawal is determined by many factors, including the period of BZD use, how rapidly use was tapered (if at all), the pharmacokinetics of the particular drug, as well as possible genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Although the onset and duration of withdrawal symptoms can vary widely based on these variables, most patients experience symptoms that last from one to two weeks, although there is a small subset that can experience prolonged symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Chronic ingestion of BZDs leads to conformational changes in the GABA receptor, which ultimately reduce the receptor's affinity for the agent and result in decreased GABA activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This decreased activity manifests as tolerance to the agent. When BZDs are no longer present or present at lower concentrations, this decreased GABA receptor activity has less inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitters, and thus, there is a pro-excitatory state.</p><p>Withdrawal can usually be avoided or minimized through the use of BZDs with a long half-life, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlordiazepoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlordiazepoxide</a>, and a gradual tapering of the patient's BZD dose over several months, depending upon the dosage and degree of dependency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BZD withdrawal is treated with a BZD that has a prolonged clinical effect, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, given intravenously and titrated to effect. The goal is to eliminate withdrawal symptoms without causing excessive sedation or respiratory depression. Once symptoms are controlled, the BZD dose should then be tapered gradually over a period of months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. BZD therapy should be avoided or used cautiously in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Concomitant medications'</a>.)</p><p>For patients in mild BZD withdrawal, a long-acting oral BZD may be given; it is also reasonable to give such a patient the BZD that they had been using chronically.</p><p>A number of medications have been used to treat BZD withdrawal, but none has been found to be as effective as BZDs. Beta blockers, antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and antihistamines have all been shown to be inferior to standard treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40</a>]. Although no controlled trials have assessed valproic acid in the treatment of BZD withdrawal, a systematic review of valproic acid for the management of alcohol withdrawal found no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Another systematic review identified one trial in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> showed a trend toward benefit in BZD withdrawal, but this was in patients already receiving BZD therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benzodiazepine-poisoning-and-withdrawal/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Pending further study, treatments other than BZDs cannot be recommended for the management of BZD withdrawal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients who are critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222).

They are commonly categorized by half-life duration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69184\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69184 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology and cellular toxicity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Kinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral BZDs taken in overdose without a coingestant rarely cause significant toxicity. The classic presentation of a patient with an isolated BZD overdose consists of CNS depression with normal vital signs. Severe overdose can cause respiratory depression and stupor or coma. Coingestants are common in cases of overdose. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of overdose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Propylene glycol (1,2 propanediol), the diluent used in parenteral formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>, is the cause of a unique and rare complication related to prolonged parenteral administration of BZDs. Potential adverse effects include hemolysis, cardiac dysrhythmias, hypotension, lactic acidosis, seizure, coma, and multisystem organ failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered mental status, a common finding in BZD overdose, is found in a wide range of medical and toxicologic conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59893 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70449 \">table 4</a>). Life-threatening causes of depressed mental status include hypoglycemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, stroke, meningitis and encephalitis, and head trauma. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BZDs are <strong>NOT</strong> detected in standard urine screening tests for drugs of abuse. However, the most common BZD urine test identifies metabolites of 1,4-benzodiazepines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a>. This test may not detect <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a>. The need for further testing is discussed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of isolated BZD ingestion are managed successfully with supportive care alone. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) is usually of NO benefit and increases the risk of aspiration.

It can be used to reverse BZD-induced sedation following general anesthesia, procedural sedation, or overdose. Administration of flumazenil can precipitate withdrawal seizures in patients who have developed a tolerance to BZDs. Therefore, the use of flumazenil in the setting of overdose remains highly controversial. We suggest consultation with a medical toxicologist or poison control center whenever the use of flumazenil is contemplated.
