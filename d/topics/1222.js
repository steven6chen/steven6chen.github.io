Since the signs and symptoms of CMV disease often overlap with other infectious processes and rejection, the diagnosis is made by integrating the clinical history, clinical presentation, and laboratory data. Because CMV produces lifelong latent infection, distinguishing active disease from latent infection and asymptomatic reactivation presents an additional diagnostic challenge.</p><p>The diagnosis and monitoring of CMV infection and tissue invasive disease will be discussed here, with an emphasis on the role of diagnostic tests and their strengths and limitations. An overview of the diagnostic tests for CMV is presented separately. The manifestations of CMV in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients are also discussed elsewhere.

The combination of viral load in the initial phase of infection and the rate of increase in viral load may help to identify patients at risk for CMV disease. These assays are now used routinely in many transplant centers to diagnose active CMV disease, screen patients for the use of preemptive antiviral therapy, and monitor responses to antiviral therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H364075720\"><span class=\"h4\">Choice of test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitative PCR tests and the CMV pp65 antigenemia test are available for detecting viral DNA and antigen, respectively. Quantitative PCR assays offer several advantages over the antigenemia assay, including better assay standardization, increased stability of the specimen, smaller specimen volume, and the ability to test patients with leukopenia. For these reasons, quantitative PCR assays are more widely used than the antigenemia test, and we prefer them for the diagnosis and monitoring of immunocompromised patients with CMV infection and disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

However, CMV DNA values were not comparable among the assays because of differences in assay design and quantification standards. As a result, the cutoff viral load associated with active CMV disease has not been established.</p><p>Standardization of CMV load values using the international CMV standard, which is now available, permits data from different studies to be compared and may provide the advantage of establishing broadly applicable and clinically relevant guidelines for use of viral load assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

These studies have shown that higher CMV loads were detected in patients with symptomatic disease compared with those with asymptomatic infection.

All patients with a viral load &gt;20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> developed CMV disease. An important limitation of these data is that these CMV DNA levels apply to the Amplicor Monitor test, which is not available clinically.

However, transplant recipients and HIV-infected individuals may have low-level viremia that does not require therapy. The decision of whether a patient requires therapy must be made on a case-by-case basis. Both conventional CMV culture and the CMV shell vial assay lack the sensitivity needed to diagnose CMV-associated viral syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21590335\"><span class=\"h3\">Tissue invasive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold standard for diagnosing CMV tissue invasive disease is the identification of CMV inclusions or positive CMV-specific immunohistochemistry staining on histopathology. A positive culture from a biopsy specimen is also considered consistent with CMV disease, but, since tissue may be contaminated with blood or body secretions and viral shedding can occur from some sites (urine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, stool) in the absence of clinical disease, it is optimal to perform both culture and histopathology on the tissue specimen.</p><p>Individuals with suspected CMV tissue invasive disease should also have plasma or whole blood PCR testing, since PCR results are often available prior to the biopsy results and may influence the decision to initiate antiviral therapy. In addition, it is important to establish the baseline viral load because serial testing is used to monitor response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H21590343\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring response to treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>A negative plasma or whole blood PCR does not exclude tissue invasive CMV disease, especially in patients with CMV gastrointestinal disease, pneumonia, or retinitis. The absence of CMV inclusions on histopathology also does not exclude tissue invasive disease since such inclusions can be missed as a result of sampling error.</p><p>In some patients, it may not be possible to obtain a tissue biopsy. When this is the case, viral load testing or culture of body fluids may be performed. Culture of urine specimens should be avoided since a positive urine culture does not correlate with CMV disease (with the exception of congenital CMV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H307493987\"><span class=\"h4\">Pneumonitis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pneumonitis in transplant recipients, the identification of CMV inclusions in cells obtained from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or lung biopsy supports the diagnosis of CMV disease.

Serologic tests have limitations. A fourfold rise in IgG may take several weeks to occur, and IgM may persist for months following primary infection, so detection may not always represent acute infection. When assessing past CMV exposure or infection, any IgG result above the cutoff of the test is considered positive. The cutoff value may vary depending on the method used and is generally provided with test results.</p><p>One study compared the performance of peripheral blood leukocyte cultures, CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and CMV antigenemia assays in a group of 52 immunocompetent patients with primary CMV infection diagnosed by serology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-diagnosis-of-cytomegalovirus-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. CMV DNA was detected in 100 percent of the 25 patients who had the PCR assay performed within one month of symptoms but in none of the controls. In comparison, antigenemia assays and peripheral blood leukocyte cultures were much less sensitive, with positive results in only 50 and 21 percent of patients, respectively, during the first four weeks of symptoms. However, DNA remained detectable by PCR in 81 percent of patients two months after presentation. The prolonged detection of CMV DNA may decrease the specificity of the test when used to detect active disease. Testing for CMV DNA in whole blood or plasma in conjunction with CMV-specific IgG could improve the specificity of the DNA test. The presence of CMV DNA combined with the absence of CMV-specific IgG support the diagnosis of acute CMV infection.</p><p>Not all studies have supported the utility of CMV PCR assays in the diagnosis of acute CMV infections in immunocompetent individuals.

The range of clinical disease due to CMV in immunocompromised patients is broad and includes febrile syndromes, hepatitis, pneumonitis, retinitis, encephalitis, esophagitis, and colitis. Since the signs and symptoms of CMV disease often overlap with other infectious processes and rejection, the diagnosis is made by integrating the clinical history, clinical presentation, and laboratory data. (See <a href=\"#H21590288\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic modalities include serology, qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pp65 antigenemia, culture, and histopathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F101937\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101937 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative PCR tests and the CMV pp65 antigenemia test are available for detecting viral replication. Quantitative PCR assays offer several advantages over the antigenemia assay, including better assay standardization, increased stability of the specimen, smaller specimen volume, and the ability to test patients with leukopenia. For these reasons, quantitative PCR assays are more widely used than the antigenemia test, and we prefer them for the diagnosis and monitoring of immunocompromised patients with CMV infection and disease. (See <a href=\"#H21590320\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H364075720\" class=\"local\">'Choice of test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic tests have no role in diagnosing CMV disease in immunocompromised patients; they are used pretransplant to establish serostatus.

The rate of increase in viral load can be used to predict patients at risk for CMV disease. Patients with CMV disease have a significantly faster rate of increase in CMV load between the last PCR-negative and first PCR-positive sample than those without CMV disease. (See <a href=\"#H21590320\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the diagnosis of CMV tissue invasive disease, we recommend histopathology and CMV-specific immunostaining of tissue biopsies. Individuals with suspected CMV tissue invasive disease should also have plasma or whole blood PCR testing, since PCR results are often available prior to the biopsy results and may influence the decision to initiate antiviral therapy. In addition, it is important to establish the baseline viral load because serial testing is used to monitor the response to therapy. Detailed recommendations for testing based upon the site of infection are presented above. (See <a href=\"#H21590335\" class=\"local\">'Tissue invasive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with CMV infection or disease, viral load should be monitored weekly using the same assay and the same specimen type (whole blood or plasma).
