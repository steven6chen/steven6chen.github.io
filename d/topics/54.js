If a woman does not get her period for a while, it might be because she is pregnant. Or in some cases, it might be that she has a medical condition that affects her reproductive system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193937767\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes absent or irregular periods?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absent or irregular periods can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCOS (which stands for &quot;polycystic ovary syndrome&quot;). In women with this condition, the ovaries make too much male hormone. This can disrupt a woman's periods and cause excess facial hair, acne, and problems with weight. PCOS is the most common cause of absent or irregular periods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being too thin or not having enough body fat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercising too much</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Too much prolactin &ndash; Prolactin is a hormone made in the &quot;pituitary gland&quot;, which is a small organ at the base of the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early menopause &ndash; Menopause is the time in a woman's life when she naturally stops having periods. Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. But in some women, menopause comes early &ndash; before the age of 40. Early menopause happens when the ovaries run out of eggs earlier than normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain types of hormonal birth control &ndash; Some forms of birth control can cause absent or irregular periods. This is more common with those that contain only the hormone progestin. Examples include the progestin-only pill (sometimes called the &quot;minipill&quot;), the implant, and hormone-containing intrauterine devices (IUDs).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193937774\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are older than 15 and still have not had your period</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You used to get periods, but you have not had a period for more than 3 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your periods happen more than 45 days apart</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193937781\"><span class=\"h1\">What other symptoms should I watch for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Make sure to tell your doctor if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Think you might be pregnant</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have family members with irregular periods</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have bad acne or hair on your chest or face</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have gained weight and are having trouble losing it</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have hot flashes, which feel like a wave of heat that starts in your chest and face and then moves through your body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have night sweats, which are hot flashes that happen when you are asleep</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have new headaches or trouble seeing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Notice milky fluid coming out of your breasts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are under lots of stress</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have recently lost weight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are exercising more than you used to</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have changed how much you eat or what kinds of foods you eat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are taking any medicines, herbs, or vitamins</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193937788\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation.</p><p>Here are the most common tests doctors use to find the cause of absent or irregular periods:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy test</strong> &ndash; Pregnancy is a common cause of missed periods.

The picture can show if there is something wrong with these organs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MRI</strong> &ndash; This test uses a large magnet to make detailed pictures of the brain.
