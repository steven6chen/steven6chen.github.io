At this stage, children begin to associate written letters with sounds. They gradually learn to recognize all of the letters within a word and to map the letters onto the correct sound.

Extracting meaning from words draws on the same skills required to understand spoken language &ndash; vocabulary, knowledge of grammatical structure, and the ability to make inference. Although reading is predominantly the product of word identification and reading comprehension, other factors such as rapid word identification and reading fluency play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of terms are used to describe reading problems.

Reading difficulty has a number of causes, the two most important of which are reading disability (ie, difficulties in decoding) and deficits in reading comprehension. The relationship between decoding deficits and reading comprehension deficits is unclear; they are considered to be separate deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most children with reading difficulties have some degree of deficit in both decoding and reading comprehension. However, some children have isolated deficiencies in either decoding or reading comprehension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Other causes of reading difficulty include environmental factors (eg, lack of exposure to books or reading, inadequate instruction), cognitive impairment, hearing impairment, language impairment, chronic illness, and psychosocial stressors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The terms &quot;dyslexia,&quot; &quot;developmental dyslexia,&quot; &quot;specific learning disorder with impairment in reading,&quot; &quot;specific reading disability,&quot; and &quot;reading disorder&quot; are also used to describe this condition, although a more specific definition for &quot;dyslexia&quot; is provided below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

It is characterized by difficulties with accurate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonologic component of language. The deficit is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede the growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.&quot;</p><p>This definition has been adopted by the United States National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development and is similar to the definition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Extracting meaning from written words requires the same skills required to understand spoken language &ndash; vocabulary, knowledge of grammatical structure, and the ability to make inference. Reading comprehension deficits are an increasingly important cause of reading problems in older children as reading materials grow more complex as they proceed through school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281043258\"><span class=\"h2\">Executive function deficits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Executive function refers to higher-order and goal-oriented skills such as memory, capacity for inference, planning, and automatic self-monitoring. Deficits in executive functions are associated with difficulties in reading comprehension even when other known variables are controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Executive function skills become more important as the length and complexity of the text increases. Whether deficits in executive function contribute to problems with phonologic <span class=\"nowrap\">awareness/word</span> identification is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reading disability tends to cluster in families with genetic factors accounting for most of the variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/3,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,34,35</a>].

The risk of reading disability is 40 to 60 percent among children of affected parents; conversely, 25 to 60 percent of parents of a child with reading disability also meet criteria for reading disability (though they may never have been formally diagnosed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/3,8,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,66,67</a>].</p><p>The genetic contribution to reading disorders almost certainly involves multiple genes that interact with various host and environmental factors to determine the extent of reading disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].

This is consistent with the abnormal neuroanatomy described below. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Neurobiology'</a> below.)</p><p>Several of the genes with the strongest evidence for a role in reading disability appear to be pleiotropic (ie, to have other phenotypic effects).
