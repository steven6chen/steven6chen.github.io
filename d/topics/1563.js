Many families of children with ASD seek both conventional and complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies as part of the process of understanding and accepting the diagnosis.

When evaluating the merits of a study, look for a homogeneous case definition, control for potential confounding variables, consistent dosing, appropriate comparison group, appropriate blinding (if applicable), valid outcome measure(s), and adequate sample size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-complementary-and-alternative-therapies/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

However, it is often difficult to perform such studies in children with ASD. Thus, much of the evidence for both conventional and CAM therapies comes from cohort studies, case-control studies, and case reports. Choosing an appropriate outcome measure is another challenge in the evaluation of interventions for ASD given the heterogeneity of presentations within the autism spectrum.

During treatment, sulforaphane recipients had improved behavior compared with baseline as assessed by parents and clinicians on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, Social Responsiveness Scale, and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale. When sulforaphane was discontinued, behavior returned to baseline. Sulforaphane appeared to be well-tolerated; however, a single unprovoked seizure occurred in two recipients, both with a history of seizures.</p><p>Although these results are promising, additional information is needed; this study was too small to adequately assess adverse effects. Pending additional study, we do not specifically recommend that children with ASD eat broccoli sprouts or other sulforaphane-rich foods (eg, brussel sprouts, broccoli), but eating these vegetables is not discouraged given the other health benefits of these foods.
