The diagnosis of chronic venous disease is confirmed by the presence of venous reflux, which is diagnosed by duplex ultrasound by duration of retrograde or reversed flow (&gt;500 ms for superficial or perforating veins, &gt;1000 ms for deep veins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>]. </p><p>Duplex ultrasonography combines real-time B-mode imaging of the deep and superficial veins with Doppler assessment of blood flow. Pulsed or color Doppler identifies vessels and the presence and direction of blood flow and is used to detect venous reflux or venous obstruction (absence of venous flow) and identify its anatomic location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>]. Combining real-time B-mode ultrasonography with directional pulsed Doppler provides complementary information about anatomic structures and flow patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/7,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11-14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In B-mode imaging, a real-time ultrasound transducer encased in a probe rapidly and automatically sweeps an ultrasound beam over the area to be imaged, constructing an image from the reflected wave [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. B-mode ultrasonography can identify blood vessels as well as other anatomic structures that can produce pain or swelling and mimic venous disease, such as popliteal (Baker) cyst, hematoma, arterial aneurysm, and other soft tissue masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

The sources of the reflected signals in peripheral vascular studies are the red blood cells moving in the vessels. Flow analysis can be performed by listening to the audible signal or by recording the spectral analysis of the signal. A computer analysis of the spectral display then determines the flow velocity, direction, and characteristics of flow (laminar versus turbulent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58548990\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Duplex imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p>For detecting proximal (above-knee) venous obstruction, B-mode imaging assesses the compressibility of the vein. Normal veins collapse with the application of pressure using the ultrasound probe; thrombosed veins do not collapse. Duplex examination of the lower extremity can also be used to predict if there is more proximal obstruction, such as iliac vein stenosis, by looking at the common femoral vein waveforms, which should be phasic and vary with respiration. If the waveform is blunted or flat without respiratory variation, a more proximal venous obstruction should be suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. When duplex ultrasonography is compared with ascending venography for a diagnosis of venous obstruction, sensitivity ranges from 86 to 96 percent and specificity ranges from 80 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/16,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-21</a>].

To detect reflux, the patient is usually examined upright and non-weight-bearing for the extremity being examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/8,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26</a>]. Blood pressure cuffs are placed on the thigh, calf, and above the ankle, and the veins are imaged with B-mode ultrasound. The blood pressure cuffs are serially inflated to occlude venous flow and then rapidly deflated to assess for reflux with the pulsed Doppler component of the duplex scanner. A reflux time that is &gt;0.5 seconds in duration is abnormal for superficial or perforating veins (&gt;1000 ms for deep veins) and indicates valvular insufficiency at that level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One study of 300 limbs found that velocity and peak flow at the peak of reflux correlated better with clinical severity compared with the reflux time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Duplex ultrasonography is more sensitive and specific than descending venography in predicting the clinical severity of venous insufficiency.

While these imaging modalities can provide clear cross-sectional images of the deep venous system, including infrainguinal areas not accessible to ultrasonography, less expensive imaging modalities that do not require the use of injectable contrast continue to be preferred as the first diagnostic imaging test. For patients who have signs of venous insufficiency but normal or equivocal Doppler ultrasonography findings, MDCT and MR venography should be considered. In certain situations, these newer imaging modalities may be helpful in identifying treatable pathology and planning surgical interventions for patients with chronic venous disease.

The test is more typically used by clinicians who perform large numbers of interventional venous procedures as a means to assess the hemodynamic results of venous interventions, or as a research tool. </p><p>APG measures pressure changes in the cuff, which are translatable to volume changes within the leg. The venous volume is measured and used to calculate a venous filling index (VFI). Changes in volume are measured by air displacement within a polyurethane cuff that is wrapped around the calf and inflated to a preset pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60955 \">figure 1</a>). The test begins with the patient supine. The limb being evaluated is elevated to drain the venous system. Once the venous system is emptied, the leg volume is recorded and the patient is asked to stand, after which the volume is recorded again. The difference in the recorded leg volume is the functional venous volume. The time needed to fill 90 percent of the functional venous volume is the venous filling time. The venous filling index is functional venous volume divided by the venous filling time; a normal venous filling index is &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span>. The greater the venous filling index, the more severe the reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The residual volume fraction, which is the ratio of the residual volume to the function venous volume, is directly proportional to ambulatory venous pressure, which is used to diagnose venous hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. </p><p>APG primarily provides an overall assessment of venous function but cannot localize sites of venous reflux. It can be used to monitor overall venous hemodynamics. Changes in APG correlate well with duplex and clinical severity of disease in cross-sectional studies, but there are few studies using APG to predict which patients are most likely to suffer complications (eg, venous ulcer recurrence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H429785890\"><span class=\"h3\">Photoplethysmography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photoplethysmography (PPG) can also be used to assess overall venous hemodynamics. Photoplethysmography is sensitive but nonspecific for the diagnosis of venous insufficiency, and, like air plethysmography, it cannot localize reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Although typically performed in a vascular laboratory, handheld PPG devices are available and may be a useful screening tool for chronic venous insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>To perform the test, a light-emitting diode (LED) is placed over the medial ankle region. Transmitted light is reflected back to the PPG diode with the intensity of the reflection indicative of the red cell content of the subcutaneous tissues. After establishing a baseline, the patient is asked to perform 10 tiptoe maneuvers, or to sequentially perform dorsi and plantar flexion of the ankle 10 times. These maneuvers serve to empty the subcutaneous veins, and the PPG recording decreases from the baseline value. As the veins refill passively, the PPG recording rises back to the baseline value. </p><p>In the presence of venous reflux, the veins refill more quickly. A venous refill time (VRT) &lt;20 seconds indicates venous reflux. If an abnormal reflux time is normalized with the application of a superficial tourniquet, isolated superficial reflux is present. If the venous refill time does not normalize, either deep venous reflux or a combination of superficial and deep venous reflux is present. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H429785979\"><span class=\"h2\">Ankle-brachial index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is also often needed to exclude arterial disease in patients with ulceration or symptoms compatible with peripheral artery disease (eg, claudication). Concurrent arterial disease is important to identify because compression therapy, which is the standard treatment for venous ulceration, is contraindicated in the presence of significant arterial occlusive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-evaluation-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-insufficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The ABI is a useful screening tool to diagnose peripheral artery disease, and an ABI &le;0.9 is diagnostic for PAD. An ABI &lt;0.4 represents advanced disease that is often associated with ischemic pain or ulcers.
