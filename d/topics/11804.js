Using genome-wide genotype data to confirm African ancestry also demonstrated a significant increased risk of nocturnal asthma associated with African ancestry. Both self-identified <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> and ancestry appear to be independent predictors of nocturnal asthma and are largely independent of lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An association between the beta-2 adrenergic receptor polymorphism and nocturnal asthma has been described in Egyptian children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nocturnal asthma was associated with the homozygous Gly16 genotype and also with a Gly16 allele. Additionally, genetic variants in microRNA genes that mediate cell regulation may be involved in nocturnal asthma. Individuals with the CC genotype of microRNA-196a2 rs11614913 <span class=\"nowrap\">(C/T)</span> were 17 times more likely to develop nocturnal asthma and had a more than 2.5-fold increased risk for poor disease outcomes compared with CT and TT individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>].</p><p/><p>The occurrence of nocturnal asthma symptoms is also reflected in mortality statistics. As an example, over a one-year period, 53 percent of asthma deaths in one report occurred at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, 79 percent of these patients had premortem complaints of asthma affecting their sleep and occurring every night in 42 percent. Thus, nocturnal asthma symptoms suggested a deterioration in asthma control that had been present over several days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asthma is associated with a circadian pattern in lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], with the best function typically occurring at approximately 4 PM, and the worst at around 4 AM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58146\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58146 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62825\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62825 \">figure 2</a>). The normal population also experiences a circadian change in lung function, but the peak-to-trough swings in peak expiratory flow rate are only 5 to 8 percent compared to a variation of 15 to 50 percent or more in asthmatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, nocturnal asthma appears to reflect an exaggeration of the effects of normal changes in neurohormonal activation that have time-related rhythms (chronobiology) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Circadian changes in lung volume, distal airway inflammation, glucocorticoid receptor affinity, pulmonary capillary blood volume, and beta-2 adrenergic receptor function may also contribute.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurohormonal changes</strong> &ndash; Several hormones are secreted in a circadian pattern that can contribute to nocturnal airway inflammation and asthma in predisposed individuals. With cortisol, for example, peak levels occur upon awakening while trough levels are noted around midnight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53078 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Corticotropin</strong> &ndash; One study evaluated the effects of hypothalamic and pituitary control of the cortisol response in nocturnal asthma by measuring corticotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin, and cortisol levels every two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Corticotropin peak levels and the area under the 24-hour curve were significantly higher in nocturnal asthmatics, but these elevations were not accompanied by a commensurate increase in cortisol levels, which were the same in nocturnal asthmatics as in non-nocturnal asthmatics and healthy controls. These findings suggest a blunted adrenal response to corticotropin in nocturnal asthma, which may play a permissive role in the nocturnal worsening of asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Melatonin</strong> &ndash; Melatonin, a sleep inducing hormone, has a proinflammatory effect in subjects with nocturnal asthma. At 4 PM, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from nocturnal asthmatics produced significantly greater amounts of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in response to costimulation with melatonin than non-nocturnal asthmatics or controls did [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, at 4 AM, non-nocturnal asthmatics demonstrated an increased response to melatonin, whereas PBMCs from nocturnal asthmatics were unable to be stimulated further. These observations suggest that the nocturnal asthma phenotype is associated with a chronically enhanced inflammatory milieu, which blunts the ability of PBMCs to respond further to stimulation at night.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">A separate investigation focused on endogenous melatonin demonstrated that peak melatonin levels occurred at approximately 2 AM, and that these levels were significantly greater in nocturnal asthmatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Furthermore, in nocturnal asthmatics alone, peak melatonin level was inversely associated with overnight change in lung function, such that higher peak melatonin levels were associated with a greater overnight fall in lung function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> &ndash; Epinephrine release also varies in a circadian fashion, with peak levels during the afternoon and trough levels during the early morning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53078 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The infusion of physiologic doses of epinephrine has been reported to lessen but not abolish the overnight decline in lung function in patients with nocturnal asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Cholinergic tone</strong> &ndash; Cholinergic (vagal) tone is increased at night and may contribute to the circadian change in airway function. A role for cholinergic tone is suggested by improvement in the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at 4 AM after administration of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, but not at 4 PM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Studies of heart rate variations induced by deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, and standing from the recumbent position in asthmatic and non-asthmatic subjects suggest enhanced parasympathetic neural drive to the sinoatrial node among subjects with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This observation is consistent with an association between increased parasympathetic activity and asthma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness</strong> &ndash; During sleep, relative hypoventilation tends to cause reduced lung volumes, which interferes with one of the body&rsquo;s compensations for airflow limitation. Normally, increasing airways resistance in asthma leads to progressive airtrapping and, thereby, an increase in lung volume. This hyperinflation is thought to decrease airway resistance by increasing circumferential traction on the airway walls. Conversely, when lung volumes decrease, airflow limitation increases due to decreased traction on the airways. In one study, patients with nocturnal asthma had reduced lung volumes during sleep, accompanied by greater than expected increases in airway resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Airway resistance remained high even when lung volumes were normalized. The loss of the normal volume-resistance coupling of the respiratory system is thought to be due to inflammation of the distal airways. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bronchial responsiveness to inhaled bronchoconstrictors is also markedly increased at night in asthmatic subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Larger circadian changes in bronchial reactivity predict a greater overnight fall in peak expiratory flow rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Distal airway inflammation</strong> &ndash; In nocturnal asthma, inflammation predominantly affects the distal, smaller airways. This observation was illustrated in a study that obtained daytime and nighttime endobronchial (airway) and transbronchial (alveolar tissue) biopsies from patients with nocturnal asthma and asthmatics without nocturnal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The greatest inflammation in nocturnal asthmatics occurred in the alveolar tissue area at 4 AM compared to 4 PM; only eosinophilic alveolar inflammation correlated with the overnight fall in lung function. These findings were supported by another study evaluating epithelial cell markers obtained by brushing the proximal and distal airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Only in the nocturnal asthma group was the expression of CD51 (vitronectin and fibronectin receptor) correlated to airway obstruction at 4 AM. This increase in CD51 in nocturnal asthma patients suggested a relationship to the lung inflammatory and repair processes in response to injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Since the CD4+ T-lymphocyte is felt to be the principal controller cell in eosinophil recruitment, lymphocyte and eosinophil influx into the alveolar tissue was evaluated at 4 AM and 4 PM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. At 4 AM, there were more alveolar tissue CD4+ cells in the nocturnal asthma group compared to the asthma control group. In addition, only alveolar tissue and not airway tissue CD4+ cells correlated inversely to lung function and positively with EG2+ eosinophils (activated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> secreted) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several studies have shown increased airway eosinophils, neutrophils, CD4 lymphocytes, superoxide production, and mediators of bronchoconstriction when bronchoalveolar lavage is performed at 4 AM in subjects with nocturnal asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. Furthermore, nocturnal lung function significantly improves when the inflammatory process is altered. Inhaled antiinflammatory agents may have difficulty reaching the small airways and alveoli due to the relatively large particle size of most inhaled glucocorticoids. Inhaled glucocorticoid preparations with extra fine particle size (&lt;2 microns mass medium aerodynamic diameter), such as HFA-beclomethasone dipropionate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciclesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciclesonide</a>, and HFA-flunisolide, may reduce peripheral lung inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Oral glucocorticoids, 50 mg oral dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at 3 PM, significantly reduced the overnight fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and produced a reduction in all cell types obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage compared with the same dose at 8 AM or 8 PM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p>The levels of mast cell mediators such as leukotrienes, interleukins, and histamine have also been shown to be elevated at night in asthmatics with nocturnal worsening and, for certain mediators, in normal subjects as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/18,32,37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,32,37-40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glucocorticoid receptor</strong> &ndash; Since the inflammatory response is increased at night, the question arises if the glucocorticoid receptor functions appropriately during that time period. One investigation demonstrated that glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity as well as glucocorticoid responsiveness exhibited a circadian variation in subjects with nocturnal asthma. There was a reduced binding affinity and suppression of peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation at 4 AM. This was not observed in normal subjects or asthma control subjects. Thus, inhibition of the antiinflammatory effect of glucocorticoids occurs at night and may contribute to the nocturnal inflammation discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary capillary blood volume</strong> &ndash; In patients with nocturnal asthma, unlike asthmatics without nocturnal asthma symptoms, the capillary blood volume significantly increases during sleep by 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This may be a contributing factor in recruiting additional inflammatory cells and producing more edema in the airways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta-2 adrenoceptor function and gene regulation</strong> &ndash; Both the number and physiologic function of beta-2 receptors are significantly decreased from 4 PM to 4 AM in asthmatics with nocturnal worsening compared to non-nocturnal asthmatics and normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This phenotypic downregulation may be related to a polymorphism within the genetic coding block of the beta-2 receptor. Specifically, glycine at position 16 (Gly16) imparts an accelerated downregulation of the receptor compared to arginine at this position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In one study, the frequency of the Gly16 allele was 80 percent among nocturnal asthmatics, compared to 52 percent for non-nocturnal asthmatics (odds ratio [OR] 3.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A subsequent metaanalysis of this study and four others noted a similarly increased frequency of the Gly16 allele among nocturnal asthmatics compared to non-nocturnal asthmatic control patients (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.56-3.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-2-adrenergic-receptor-dysfunction-and-polymorphism-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta-2 adrenergic receptor dysfunction and polymorphism in asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H240128578\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical presentation of nocturnal asthma is the occurrence of typical asthma symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing, cough) at night in a patient with daytime asthma symptoms. The frequency and severity of nocturnal asthma symptoms usually parallel daytime asthma symptoms and the degree of airflow limitation. </p><p>For most adults with asthma, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma occurring twice a month or less often correlate with daytime asthma symptoms two or fewer days a week and normal spirometry; nocturnal awakenings occurring one to three nights a week correlate with daytime symptoms more than two days a week and mild airflow limitation on spirometry or peak flow; and nocturnal awakenings four or more nights a week correlate with asthma symptoms throughout the day and a forced expiratory volume in one second or peak flow of less than 60 percent of predicted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65972 \">table 1</a>). Similar correlations are described in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73634 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52149\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52149 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>While some patients find nocturnal symptoms particularly bothersome, others are less troubled by the symptoms and fail to report them unless specifically questioned. For children, nocturnal asthma is associated with poor sleep quality and poor parent quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25079995\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation and diagnosis of nocturnal asthma parallels that of asthma in general. The first step is confirmation of the diagnosis of asthma, which is based on a history of typical, intermittent symptoms of asthma, demonstration of reversible airflow limitation (preferably by spirometry), and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Frequently, the diagnosis is clear, based on known underlying asthma and response to a trial of therapy. If symptoms do not respond to empiric therapy, objective confirmation may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H25080816\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4534333\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation and a trial of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a clear diagnosis of asthma, typical asthma symptoms occurring during the night or in the early morning are usually due to asthma. At the time of new onset nocturnal symptoms, we typically obtain office spirometry to assess daytime asthma control and to guide selection of controller medication(s) for initial therapy, as described below. If nocturnal symptoms respond to empiric treatment of asthma, further diagnostic testing is not necessary. (See <a href=\"#H25080706\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;, section on 'Initiating therapy in previously untreated patients'</a>.)</p><p>For patients without a prior diagnosis of asthma, we obtain spirometry before and after inhaled bronchodilator to assess for reversible airflow limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. If spirometry is normal, the next step can either be a trial of empiric therapy for asthma or bronchoprovocation testing, depending on the preference of the patient and physician. If spirometry shows normal airflow, but reduced lung volumes, we consider other possible explanations for symptoms, such as heart failure or hypersensitivity pneumonitis among others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;, section on 'Restrictive ventilatory defect'</a>.)</p><p>Laboratory tests such as total IgE and an eosinophil count are generally not helpful. If heart failure appears likely, a plasma brain natriuretic peptide is obtained. When hypersensitivity pneumonitis is considered, serologic tests for suspected inciting agents are sent. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may also be useful in diagnosing hypersensitivity pneumonitis.</p><p>The chest radiograph almost always shows normal or slightly hyperinflated lung parenchyma in patients with asthma. A chest radiograph is more likely to be helpful when heart failure or hypersensitivity pneumonitis are suspected. (See <a href=\"#H25080816\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4535091\"><span class=\"h2\">Objective confirmation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If nocturnal symptoms do not respond to empiric asthma therapy, the next step is usually to obtain objective confirmation that the nocturnal symptoms are associated with airflow limitation. The simplest device for home measurement of airflow is the peak expiratory flow (PEF) meter. PEF is typically measured at bedtime and on arising in the morning. However, it is also useful to obtain PEF measurements if the patient awakens for any reason during the night. That is, many asthmatic patients, do not perceive bronchoconstrictive symptoms very well, particularly at night. A PEF measurement can be of value at this point for both the patient and care giver. </p><p>PEF variability of 15 percent or greater is consistent with asthma. However, the lack of PEF variability does not exclude the possibility of nocturnal asthma. It has been demonstrated that twice daily measurements of PEF fail to detect 55 to 80 percent of the maximum circadian variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This does not imply that variability in PEF measurements is not found. Additional information about peak flow monitoring is provided separately. Other devices that measure both PEF and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) can also be used and may give additional information. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peak expiratory flow rate monitoring in asthma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-a-peak-flow-meter-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: How to use a peak flow meter (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268240845\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of contributing factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with infrequent nocturnal asthma symptoms, the potential contribution of factors, such as environmental allergens, cigarette smoking, and gastroesophageal reflux, is assessed with a series of assessment questions such as those in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80507 \">table 4</a>). The need for further evaluation is based on the responses to questioning. When a particular allergen exposure is suspected (eg, animal dander), skin testing or allergen immunoassays can be used for confirmation of sensitivity. </p><p>When assessing potential allergen triggers, it is important to remember that asthmatic responses to a given allergen exposure can be circadian dependent. A late asthmatic response (LAR) from allergen exposure is generally stated to occur in approximately 40 to 50 percent of asthmatic patients and is manifest by a recurrence of asthma symptoms several hours after the initial exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. However, the likelihood of an LAR is dependent on the time of inhalation exposure. If the exposure occurs in the evening instead of the morning, a LAR develops in close to 100 percent of sensitive asthmatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. As an example, if a sensitive asthmatic comes in contact with a cat during the daytime, both an immediate and LAR will be seen about 40 to 50 percent of the time. If the exposure occurs in the evening, close to 100 percent will develop both immediate and LAR.

Among 487 patients with mild to moderate asthma, sleep disturbance was common based on sleep quality questionnaires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Polysomnography is suggested in patients with symptoms and clinical features suggestive of OSA (eg, daytime somnolence, snoring), particularly when nocturnal symptoms are persistent despite improved daytime asthma control.

Depending on the timing of the exposure, symptoms may be nocturnal. Typically, the clinical setting (eg, farmer, poultry worker) and onset of symptoms away from the exposure are clues to the diagnosis of HP, but inciting agents such as feather bedding or a bedroom humidifier can cause HP to mimic nocturnal asthma. The concomitant presence of fever, a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing, and radiographic opacities help to differentiate HP from nocturnal asthma.

However, the relationship between GER and nocturnal asthma is controversial. The treatment of GER and its role in asthma management are discussed separately. The use of a protein pump inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>, in asthmatic patients with documented gastroesophageal reflux demonstrated that nighttime asthma symptom scores improved by over 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

In awake asthmatics with a diagnosis of GER, acid infusion in the supine position produced a decrease in peak flows and an increase in specific airway resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, at least two studies suggest a lack of influence of GER in nocturnal asthma.

The increase in lower airway resistance over the night was not affected by the presence or absence of acid in the esophagus. Additionally, in a small double-blind crossover study in nocturnal asthmatics with gastroesophageal reflux, there were no differences in peak expiratory flow measurements, symptoms, or bronchodilator use in patients treated with placebo versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>Nonetheless, GER with aspiration could play a role in nocturnal asthma in a given patient.

As long as these symptoms occur less than once or twice a month, additional controller medication (eg, inhaled glucocorticoids) is not needed. However, it is reasonable to determine whether nocturnal allergen exposure, allergic or nonallergic rhinosinusitis, or gastroesophageal reflux are contributing to these intermittent symptoms, as preventive measures may reduce the frequency of nocturnal asthma symptoms.

While early studies evaluating the role of LABAs in nocturnal asthma used monotherapy, this practice is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>LABAs can lead to improved overnight lung function but not total elimination of the nocturnal decrement in lung function. As an example, in one double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 20 patients with nocturnal asthma, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a> at a dose of 50 mcg twice daily significantly improved overnight PEFR by a mean value of 69 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> and led to an improvement in sleep quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-asthma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Only prednisone at 3 PM resulted in a reduction in the overnight fall in FEV<sub>1</sub> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77820\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77820 \">figure 5</a>); this regimen was also associated with a pancellular reduction in 4 AM bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66032 \">figure 6</a>). These benefits were not seen with the other dosing regimens. Further study is needed to validate this approach and to determine whether this regimen would lead to other problems such as missed doses or insomnia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Would treatment of obstructive sleep apnea reduce asthma symptoms? </strong>If not already addressed, the patient is evaluated for symptoms (eg, daytime somnolence, poor sleep quality, snoring) and signs (eg, obesity, micrognathia, a crowded oropharyngeal airway) that might suggest concomitant OSA. Polysomnography is suggested in patients with symptoms and clinical features suggestive of OSA, particularly when nocturnal symptoms are persistent. As noted above, treatment of OSA is associated with improved asthma control. (See <a href=\"#H25080816\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4535101\" class=\"local\">'Obstructive sleep apnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocturnal worsening of asthma is a significant clinical problem for patients with asthma. Approximately 30 to 70 percent of patients with asthma report nocturnal asthma symptoms at least once a month. (See <a href=\"#H25079903\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocturnal asthma appears to reflect an exaggeration of the normal time-related rhythms (chronobiology) in neurohormonal control of airway inflammation and smooth muscle tone. Circadian changes in distal airway inflammation, glucocorticoid receptor affinity, pulmonary capillary blood volume, and beta-2 adrenergic receptor function may also contribute. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency and severity of nocturnal asthma symptoms usually parallel daytime asthma symptoms and airflow limitation. While some patients find nocturnal symptoms particularly bothersome, others are less troubled by the symptoms and fail to report them unless specifically questioned. (See <a href=\"#H240128578\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring of expiratory peak flow twice daily with a portable peak flow meter helps to confirm the diagnosis and allows for assessment of the response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H25079995\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of nocturnal asthma includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gastroesophageal reflux (GER), obstructive sleep apnea, heart failure, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In addition, these same processes may coexist with asthma. (See <a href=\"#H25080816\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inciting allergen exposure, rhinosinusitis, symptomatic GER, and sleep apnea should be controlled when present. (See <a href=\"#H268240714\" class=\"local\">'Treating contributors to nocturnal asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with infrequent nocturnal asthma symptoms, a short-acting, inhaled beta agonist medication is used for quick relief of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H268240687\" class=\"local\">'Infrequent nocturnal asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have nocturnal asthma symptoms one or more times a week, the initial management follows the general approach to asthma therapy based on severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58247\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58247 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71181\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71181 \">table 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80908 \">table 8</a>). Once the severity of asthma has been determined, medications are initiated in a stepwise fashion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56729 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67459 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76669\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76669 \">figure 9</a>). Inhaled glucocorticoids form the foundation of asthma controller therapy; a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) is typically added, if inhaled glucocorticoids are insufficient. (See <a href=\"#H25080885\" class=\"local\">'Nocturnal symptoms due to poor control of asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As noted in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56729 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67459 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76669\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76669 \">figure 9</a>), comorbidities (eg, gastroesophageal reflux, rhinosinusitis, and obstructive sleep apnea) should be appropriately treated. (See <a href=\"#H268240714\" class=\"local\">'Treating contributors to nocturnal asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If nocturnal symptoms and nocturnal decrements in peak flow are not eliminated with the combination of an inhaled glucocorticoid and a LABA, a leukotriene receptor antagonist or a once-daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> preparation can be given with the evening meal (6 to 7 PM). (See <a href=\"#H25080885\" class=\"local\">'Nocturnal symptoms due to poor control of asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe persistent asthma who have refractory nocturnal asthma symptoms despite oral glucocorticoids, timing the medication dosing to optimize its effect, known as chronotherapy, may be helpful. Once daily oral glucocorticoids appear to provide better control of nocturnal symptoms when given at 3 to 4 PM, rather than at 7 to 8 AM or 7 to 8 PM, although this needs confirmation in larger studies. (See <a href=\"#H268240494\" class=\"local\">'Options for refractory nocturnal asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other possible explanations for refractory nocturnal asthma symptoms include medication nonadherence, nocturnal triggers, residual small airway inflammation, an alternate diagnosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. (See <a href=\"#H268240494\" class=\"local\">'Options for refractory nocturnal asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tiotropium</a>, a 24-hour anticholinergic agent, may be of benefit in certain patients with nocturnal asthma, although further study is needed for confirmation.
