From a cardiovascular viewpoint, they can both raise blood pressure and affect overall cardiovascular risk.</p><p>The effect of NSAIDs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> on blood pressure and the development of hypertension will be reviewed here. The cardiovascular effects of NSAIDs as well as their adverse effects in patients with chronic kidney disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF NSAIDS ON BLOOD PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All NSAIDs in doses adequate to reduce inflammation and pain can increase blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The average rise in blood pressure is <span class=\"nowrap\">3/2</span> mmHg but varies considerably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. These effects may contribute to the increase in cardiovascular risk associated with the selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, NSAID use may reduce the effect of all antihypertensive drugs except calcium channel blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, a small study of Japanese individuals initiating antihypertensive therapy suggested that the effect of NSAID use on beta-blocker efficacy might also be minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; in that study, the mean difference in systolic pressure reduction comparing NSAID users and nonusers among 364 patients taking beta blockers was only 0.4 mmHg.</p><p>The prohypertensive effect is dose dependent and probably involves inhibition of COX-2 in the kidneys, which reduces sodium excretion and increases intravascular volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> has no COX-2-inhibiting or prohypertensive effects. As an example, 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of aspirin did not interfere with antihypertensive therapy, as compared with placebo, in 18,790 patients in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, these conclusions cannot be extended to larger doses of aspirin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF ACETAMINOPHEN ON BLOOD PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> produces its analgesic effect by inhibiting the same cyclooxygenase (COX), prostaglandin H2 synthase, that is the target of NSAIDs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, acetaminophen blocks this enzyme at its peroxidase catalytic rather than at the COX catalytic site. Therefore, the acetaminophen-mediated inhibition is sensitive to changes in the tissue peroxide levels; higher concentrations of peroxide in activated leukocytes and platelets block the effect of acetaminophen on inflammation and platelet thrombosis. However, acetaminophen is able to inhibit prostaglandins in the central nervous system, thus providing relief of pain and fever. Therefore, acetaminophen is not an NSAID or antithrombotic agent.</p><p>Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], studies have shown an increase in blood pressure and cardiovascular events with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>. In one two-week, randomized, crossover trial in 33 patients with coronary artery disease, acetaminophen (1 g three times daily), but not placebo, increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as determined by ambulatory monitoring from 122 to 125 mmHg systolic and from 73 to 75 mmHg diastolic; however, measures of endothelial and platelet function did not change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Intravenous acetaminophen, by contrast, may lower blood pressure, as was shown in both healthy subjects and patients in the intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>The effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> on blood pressure may be smaller than the effects of NSAIDs. As an example, in one randomized trial of postpartum analgesia in previously preeclamptic women, the incidence of hypertension (defined as a pressure greater than or equal to 150 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic) was significantly larger with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> compared with acetaminophen (63 versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>There are inconclusive data of an increased cardiovascular risk from regular use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> in usual doses that are widely used for pain relief. No rise in blood pressure was seen with chronic acetaminophen use in a large group of hypertensive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541704312\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS TAKING NSAIDS AND ACETAMINOPHEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many hypertensive patients require chronic analgesic therapy with NSAIDs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> in order to treat chronic pain (eg, due to osteoarthritis). Overall, management of hypertension in such patients is similar to the management in patients who do not chronically use these medications. However, attention should be paid to the following aspects of care:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the possible exception of calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs can inhibit the effectiveness of most antihypertensive drugs. Thus, use of a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>), which is acceptable first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension, may simplify the management of such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;, section on 'Choice of drug'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDS increase blood pressure at least in part by reducing sodium excretion by the kidney. Thus, it is important to remind hypertensive patients taking chronic NSAID therapy to limit their sodium intake. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salt-intake-salt-restriction-and-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salt intake, salt restriction, and primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More frequent monitoring of blood pressure, including home monitoring, may be required, particularly if patients change analgesics or analgesic doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs can cause an acute deterioration in glomerular filtration rate; no single NSAID appears safer than the others. Patients taking antihypertensive medications who initiate NSAID therapy should have their serum creatinine monitored at two- to four-week intervals until it is certain that it is stable. Most renal effects of NSAIDs should be apparent in the first month. Thereafter, we monitor the serum creatinine every 6 to 12 months or if there is a change in the dose of NSAID therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Patients with heart failure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), given in doses adequate to reduce inflammation and pain, can increase blood pressure and diminish the antihypertensive efficacy of antihypertensive drugs. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> may also transiently increase blood pressure at doses commonly used for pain relief.
