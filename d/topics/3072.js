The two main underlying pathologic mechanisms are increased destruction or decreased production. Severe neonatal thrombocytopenia (platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL)</span> is associated with bleeding and, potentially, significant morbidity, although there is a poor correlation between platelet count and incidence of bleeding. As a result, it is important to identify at-risk infants, and if needed, initiate therapy to prevent associated complications.</p><p>The incidence and more common causes of thrombocytopenia in the newborn are reviewed here. The evaluation and general management of neonatal thrombocytopenia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS AND INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal thrombocytopenia is typically defined as a platelet count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL</span> based upon the definition used in adults, which corresponds to values at or below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile. Degrees of thrombocytopenia can be further subdivided into mild (platelet count 100,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL),</span> moderate (50,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">99,000/microL),</span> and severe <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;50,000/microL)</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, healthy preterm and term newborns can have platelet counts below the defined normal platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. This was best illustrated in a study from the Intermountain Healthcare group that reviewed the platelet counts of 34,146 neonates (gestational age [GA] from 22 to 42 weeks) during the first three days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In neonates, the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile was lower than the standard adult value of <span class=\"nowrap\">150,000/microL</span> and decreased with decreasing GA. For example, the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile was <span class=\"nowrap\">104,200/microL</span> for infants below 32 weeks gestation, and was <span class=\"nowrap\">123,100/microL</span> for late preterm (34 to 36 weeks gestation) and term (GA greater than 37 weeks) infants. Platelet counts increased with advancing postnatal age.</p><p/><p>In another report from the Intermountain Healthcare group, the incidence of thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL)</span> was 31 percent for small for gestational age (SGA) infants (birth weight [BW] &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile for GA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Ten percent of the infants with thrombocytopenia (3.5 percent of the entire SGA cohort) had a recognized cause of thrombocytopenia (disseminated intravascular coagulation, early-onset sepsis, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]), which was associated with a high mortality rate (65 percent). The remaining majority did not have an obvious underlying etiology and had a low mortality rate (2 percent) with a mean nadir count of <span class=\"nowrap\">93,000/microL</span> at day 4 of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H457204138\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL)</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent thrombocytopenia can result in bleeding. Severe neonatal thrombocytopenia is uncommon in the general healthy newborn population, with a reported incidence between 0.14 and 0.24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Severe thrombocytopenia is more common in infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), with a reported incidence between 2.4 and 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The risk of thrombocytopenia is highest in the most preterm infants. A retrospective study of 284 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g) born between 2003 and 2004 reported that 28 percent of patients developed severe thrombocytopenia in the first three days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this NICU cohort, platelet counts of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL</span> were detected in 73 and 56 percent of infants, respectively. Data from NICUs in the United Kingdom demonstrated that 5 percent of infants admitted to NICUs had a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;60,000/microL</span> and 60 percent of these patients received platelet transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of thrombocytopenia can be classified by several different methods including platelet size (ie, large, normal, and small), mode of acquisition (congenital or acquired), early (&lt;72 hours of age) or late (&ge;72 hours of age) onset, gestational age (GA), or underlying pathologic mechanisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12446239\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This review will use categorization based on the underlying mechanism of thrombocytopenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52668\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52668 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased destruction including immune-mediated platelet destruction or consumption</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased production in the bone marrow</p><p/><p>Increased platelet destruction is the most common mechanism for neonatal thrombocytopenia. In some conditions (eg, bacterial sepsis) both increased destruction and suppressed bone marrow production contribute to thrombocytopenia.</p><p>Case series report that a cause of thrombocytopenia is identified in about in 50 to 75 percent of neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12446246\"><span class=\"h2\">Gestational age and onset of thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of thrombocytopenia also vary depending on GA (preterm versus term infants) and the onset of thrombocytopenia. These classifications are useful in the diagnostic evaluation of neonatal thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia#H169997725\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation to identify underlying cause'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED DESTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased platelet destruction is seen in a number of neonatal conditions. In particular, thrombocytopenia due to an underlying immunologic mechanism is a common cause of early-onset neonatal thrombocytopenia, especially in otherwise healthy newborns. This is caused by the placental crossing of maternal antibodies, which destroy neonatal platelets. In a French prospective study, the incidence of immune thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL,</span> in the general newborn population was estimated at 0.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT), also referred to as fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT), occurs when fetal platelets contain an antigen inherited from the father that the mother lacks. The mother forms immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antiplatelet antibodies against the &quot;foreign&quot; antigen, which cross the placenta and destroy fetal platelets that express the paternal antigen. This results in fetal and neonatal thrombocytopenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11709139\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of NAIT has been estimated at 1 in 1000 to 10,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,14</a>]. A 2014 systematic review of prospective studies reported the incidence of severe thrombocytopenia was 0.15 percent in the general newborn population, and NAIT was diagnosed in one-quarter of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mother of a newborn with NAIT is asymptomatic, although she or a sister may have a history of previously affected pregnancies. Clinical findings in affected newborns, who otherwise look well, are dependent on the severity of thrombocytopenia. These include petechiae, bruising, and bleeding in neonates with moderately severe to severe thrombocytopenia. The most serious complication is intracranial hemorrhage, which occurs in approximately 10 to 20 percent of affected newborns; one-quarter to one-half of these incidences take place in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The risk of severe thrombocytopenia and intracranial hemorrhage is greater in alloimmune than in autoimmune thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The risk is greater in NAIT with infants born of multigravidas compared to primigravidas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p>In a case series of 123 live-born infants with NAIT, clinical presentations and their relative frequency included the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin bleeding only &minus; 47 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No bleeding &minus; 34 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracranial hemorrhage &minus; 14 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other major organ bleeding (gastrointestinal, lung, retina) &minus; 2 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12445571\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of NAIT should be considered in any otherwise well-appearing term infant who presents with severe unexplained thrombocytopenia in the first 24 to 48 hours of life. However, NAIT also needs to be considered in ill-appearing infants, especially if severe thrombocytopenia is present, appears to be out of proportion to the clinical illness, or persists when the clinical illness improves. As an example, in a case series of 220 thrombocytopenic neonates, one-third of 110 cases that were diagnosed as NAIT occurred in infants who were clinically ill and in whom other causes were first being entertained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The diagnosis is confirmed by serologic testing that demonstrates the presence of maternal antihuman platelet antibody (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95887\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef95887 \">algorithm 1</a>).

If available, DNA testing can be performed on the maternal and paternal blood to identify the platelet antigen genotypes. However, testing should be performed in an experienced reference laboratory because of the required technology and resources needed for this specialized testing. For example, accurate testing requires a large number of typed controls for antibody detection, and the ability to type multiple antigens.

In our practice, we use the following management approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Term infants who are not ill and have no other risk factors for hemorrhage (eg, traumatic delivery) are transfused if the platelet count is <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;30,000/microL</span> or if there are signs of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The threshold for transfusion is higher <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;50,000/microL)</span> in preterm infants or in term infants who are ill or have risk factors (eg, fetal or neonatal distress).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our initial evaluation includes a cranial ultrasound examination to detect hemorrhage. If an intracranial hemorrhage is present, a higher threshold should be used for platelet transfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;50,000/microL)</span>. If a platelet transfusion is administered, the platelet count should be maintained above <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span> in infants who have evidence of intracranial hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate platelet counts should be maintained during the first 72 to 96 hours because the risk of intracranial hemorrhage is highest during this period. After the infant has reached 96 hours of age, the decision to transfuse platelets depends upon clinical circumstances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia#H12447009\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Platelet transfusion'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In an infant with severe thrombocytopenia or hemorrhage, random donor platelets should be used initially as they have been shown to be effective in rapidly increasing the platelet count, even though survival of incompatible platelets may be short [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>]. In the meantime, arrangements can be made to acquire maternal platelets for future transfusions, which are preferred because they will not react with the maternally derived antiplatelet antibodies. The use of concentrated maternal platelets (reduces the amount of serum that contains antiplatelet antibodies) may delay the transfusion process, as it may take up to 12 to 24 hours to collect and properly process the cells. Concentrating platelets is preferred to washing platelets, as washing damages the donor platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The platelets should be irradiated to avoid graft-versus-host disease. Alternatively, donor platelets that are typed and matched to the mother's cells, in order to exclude the offending platelet antigen, can be used. However, it is unlikely that matched platelets will be available in an emergent setting. If ABO incompatible platelets need to be transfused, the plasma component should be reduced to avoid potential hemolysis.</p><p>Another option includes administration of &quot;universal&quot; platelet concentrates that are human platelet antigen <span class=\"nowrap\">(HPA)-1a-negative/HPA-5b-negative</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The diagnosis usually is apparent from the mother's medical history and maternal thrombocytopenia. However, the platelet count of affected mothers may be normal after a splenectomy or if there is sufficient compensatory thrombopoiesis.

However, asphyxia is also associated with DIC, which may cause platelet activation and consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/1,64,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,64,67</a>].</p><p>Based on retrospective case series, one-third to one-half of neonates with perinatal asphyxia developed thrombocytopenia (platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL)</span> that presented within the first 48 hours of life, with a nadir occurring on the third day of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/64,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,67</a>].

In one of the case series noted above, one-quarter of the neonates with perinatal asphyxia were treated with therapeutic hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Although infants treated with therapeutic hypothermia had lower platelet counts at birth, the decrease in platelet counts over the first three to four days was similar in both groups, suggesting that therapeutic hypothermia did not independently cause thrombocytopenia. Nevertheless, therapeutic hypothermia does adversely affect platelet function, causing a prolongation of the bleeding time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].
