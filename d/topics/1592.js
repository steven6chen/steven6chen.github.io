Cysts in the liver and pancreas are common in adults with ADPKD, but are infrequently observed in pediatric patients.

Of the 47 children from 33 families who satisfied the diagnostic criteria of ADPKD, 31 were diagnosed by postnatal ultrasound screening and 16 were diagnosed after presenting with symptoms. Symptoms included urinary tract infection (n = 6), abdominal or back pain (n = 5), abnormal kidneys on antenatal ultrasound (n = 3), hematuria (n = 1), and enuresis (n = 1). After a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, the screening and symptomatic groups had similar incidences of hypertension (16 versus 13 percent), multiple cysts detected by ultrasound (84 versus 75 percent), and enlarged kidneys (defined as greater than two standard deviations of normal age-matched controls measured by ultrasound, 51 versus 56 percent). Although not statistically significant, the symptomatic group had a higher rate of albuminuria (50 versus 29 percent), but was less likely to have an estimated GFR below 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>(33 versus 43 percent).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study of 420 children with a family history of ADPKD, an initial renal ultrasonography performed at a mean age of 8.3 years detected cysts in 46 percent of patients, including 43 with unilateral cysts and 150 with bilateral cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Of the 120 children without cysts on the initial study, follow-up renal ultrasound detected cysts in 30 percent of patients older than 15 years of age at follow-up (13 of 43 patients) and 18 percent of those who were younger than 15 years at follow-up (18 of 77 patients). These results suggest that the sensitivity of renal ultrasonography as a screening test improved with age; however, there remains a significant false-negative result in younger children.</p><p>It has been suggested that in the setting of a known family history, ADPKD can be diagnosed in any child with bilateral cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging are superior for definition of renal cysts in ADPKD, but are typically not required in the clinical setting. Genetic testing is suggested in cases when a definite diagnosis is required and the ultrasound results remain negative or equivocal. (See <a href=\"#H281716636\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>The ultrasonographic appearance may not distinguish autosomal recessive from autosomal dominant disease, especially very early in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In this setting, a careful family history and analysis of the parents are helpful. Affected parents with ADPKD under the age of 25 to 30 years may not yet have cysts detectable on ultrasonography and establishing the diagnosis may require evaluation of the grandparents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In addition, extrarenal (hepatic, pancreatic) cysts also favor the presence of autosomal dominant disease, while portal fibrosis or signs of portal hypertension, cholangitis, or biliary dysgenesis favor the diagnosis of autosomal recessive disease.

Most antenatal studies have been performed between 31 and 36 weeks gestation, usually at the request of the parents. Enlarged, hyperechogenic kidneys are the primary finding, but cysts may already be visible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>The ultrasonographic finding of enlarged, echogenic kidneys in the fetus is <strong>not</strong> diagnostic of ADPKD.

Other disorders that can produce these changes include autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, malformative syndromes such as the Meckel syndrome, renal dysplasia, the congenital nephrotic syndrome, and transient nephromegaly in which the ultrasonographic abnormalities return to normal after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>As noted previously, renal cysts develop over time. Therefore, a normal antenatal renal ultrasound <strong>does not</strong> exclude the diagnosis of ADPKD. In fact, studies suggest that a diagnosis of ADPKD cannot be excluded until fewer than two renal cysts are observed by ultrasonography in at-risk individuals aged 40 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281716636\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with equivocal imaging results <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when a definite diagnosis is required, genetic testing can be performed.

Although some advocate that screening should not be performed in children because the adverse consequence of a positive diagnosis prior to symptoms in young individuals (eg, career, educational, emotional, and insurability issues) far outweigh any benefits, as there is a current lack of effective therapy, others suggest early diagnosis provides an opportunity for maximal anticipatory care (ie, blood pressure control) and the future opportunity to benefit from new therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. For example, in one study of 85 children and young adults with ADPKD, patients who were hypertensive were more likely to have deterioration in renal function compared with nonhypertensive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

When no family history of ADPKD is present, but the sonographic findings are consistent with ADPKD, screening of parents should be performed. In patients without a family history of ADPKD, other cystic kidney disease must be considered. In particular, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) may be differentiated from dominant polycystic disease by the finding of congenital hepatic fibrosis that is seen in all patients with ARPKD.

Treatment is focused on managing pain and complications including hypertension and urinary infections. Children with significant nephromegaly may wish to avoid contact sports due to increased risk of cyst rupture with minor trauma. We also advise affected children to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs due to potential for increased risk of cyst hemorrhage. In addition, patients should have a large daily fluid intake and avoid caffeine intake to suppress antidiuretic hormone secretion and prevent stone formation.</p><p>Other promising therapies, which are being tested in clinical trials, include vasopressin receptor antagonists, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway inhibitors, and rigorous blood pressure control with maximal inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], which are discussed elsewhere.
