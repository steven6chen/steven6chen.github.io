They are among the most serious and potentially fatal complications of transplantation. While the majority appears to be related to the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), EBV-negative disease does occur. Three general types of PTLD have been described in transplant recipients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early lesions</strong> (ie, plasmacytic hyperplasia and infectious mononucleosis-like PTLD) &ndash; This presents as an infectious mononucleosis-type acute illness characterized by polyclonal B cell proliferation with no evidence to suggest malignant transformation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polymorphic PTLD</strong> &ndash; Polymorphic PTLD are polyclonal or monoclonal lymphoid infiltrates that demonstrate evidence of malignant transformation but do not meet all of the criteria for one of the B cell or <span class=\"nowrap\">T/NK</span> cell lymphomas recognized in immunocompetent patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monomorphic PTLD</strong> &ndash; Monomorphic PTLD are monoclonal lymphoid proliferations that meet the criteria for one of the B cell or <span class=\"nowrap\">T/NK</span> cell lymphomas recognized in immunocompetent patients.</p><p/><p>These conditions lie along a continuum of disease and are categorized by the 2008 World Health Organization classification system as PTLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Of importance, small B cell lymphoid neoplasms (eg, follicular lymphomas, small lymphocytic lymphoma) and marginal zone (MALT) lymphomas arising in the post-transplant setting are <strong>not </strong>considered PTLD.</p><p>PTLD following solid organ and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant will be reviewed here.

EBV is a common pathogen in most parts of the world, as approximately 90 to 95 percent of adults show serologic evidence of infection. Acute EBV infection leads to a polyclonal expansion of B cells harboring the virus. In immunocompetent individuals, viral antigens expressed by these B cells elicit a T cell response that eliminates the vast majority of the infected B cells. However, a small subpopulation of the infected B cells downregulates viral antigen expression and escapes immune surveillance. These latently infected B cells persist throughout life and, if T cell immunity wanes, can give rise to lymphoproliferative disorders such as PTLD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-epstein-barr-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of Epstein-Barr virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cellular events underlying EBV-induced B cell proliferation have been studied in vitro and in vivo. A number of EBV-encoded proteins drive signaling events that directly contribute to B cell growth and survival. Two membrane proteins, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]) and latent membrane protein 2A (LMP-2A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]), transmit signals that are believed to mimic certain aspects of antigen-mediated B cell activation. Two other nuclear EBV proteins, EBNA-2 and EBNA-LP, form a transcriptional regulatory complex that upregulates pro-growth factors such as c-Myc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In concert, these and other EBV-encoded factors can transform B cells into immortal lymphoblastoid B cells. Polymorphisms within cytokine genes may also contribute to the susceptibility of the host to such proliferations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-epstein-barr-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of Epstein-Barr virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The EBV-infected B cells that give rise to PTLD can originate in the host (recipient) or the donor. Following solid organ transplantation, host-derived PTLD is most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. As an example, in one study utilizing a polymorphism at the D4S174 locus on chromosome 4, 10 of 11 cases originated from host cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In solid organ transplant recipients, host-derived PTLD is typically a multisystem disease, while donor-derived PTLD is more commonly limited to the allograft tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In contrast, donor-derived PTLD is much more common than host-derived PTLD following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and involves nodal and extranodal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3062244\"><span class=\"h3\">Solid organ transplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of EBV in the pathogenesis of PTLD among solid organ transplant recipients has been suggested by the identification of EBV in the tumor and by case-control studies. As an example, a study of liver transplant recipients demonstrated EBV mRNA in lymphoid cells infiltrating liver biopsies taken to monitor graft rejection in most patients before overt lymphoproliferative disease was documented; this finding was generally absent in controls who did not go on to develop lymphoproliferative disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-epstein-barr-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of Epstein-Barr virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3062252\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike in solid organ transplant recipients, PTLD in HCT recipients is most commonly donor-derived. In this setting, PTLD is thought to be due to the proliferation of EBV-infected B cells in the absence of normal T cell immune surveillance. If a hematopoietic stem cell donor has been infected with EBV, he or she will have a small number of transformed B cells carrying the virus (about one per million B cells). These B cells are &quot;held in check&quot; by cytotoxic T cells, resulting in an equilibrium between cell division and death of EBV-infected B cells.</p><p>Methods of treating bone marrow that remove both mature B and T cells (such as soybean lectin depletion) have a lower rate of EBV lymphoproliferative disease after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. If, however, mature T cells are depleted from a marrow graft (to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease [GVHD]) but B cells are not depleted, then these EBV-transformed B cells may &quot;escape&quot; from cytotoxic T cell surveillance, increasing the likelihood of PTLD.</p><p>A retrospective study compared rates of EBV reactivation in 85 EBV-seropositive recipients of a T cell depleted allograft (TCD-HCT) with that of 65 EBV-seropositive recipients of an unmanipulated allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Reactivation was observed more frequently in recipients of a TCD-HCT (65 versus 31 percent), and EBV-associated PTLD occurred only in those receiving a TCD-HCT. In addition, high plasma EBV DNA levels predicted the development of EBV-PTLD.</p><p>In addition to the risk imposed by the donor, the transplant recipient is also likely to have been infected with EBV. Ablation of the recipient's immune system prior to transplantation may remove enough cytotoxic cells to allow for proliferation of donor-transformed B cells as well, particularly in the setting of cord blood stem cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Profound deficiencies of EBV-specific T cell-mediated immunity have been documented in the early post-transplant period, the period of greatest risk for PTLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3062237\"><span class=\"h2\">EBV-negative disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EBV-negative PTLD has been documented in up to 30 percent of PTLD in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/1,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24</a>]. The etiology of EBV-negative PTLD has not been fully elucidated, but gene expression profiling studies suggest that they are biologically distinct from EBV-positive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Some may be related to EBV infections that are no longer detectable. Others may be due to unidentified viruses or other causes of chronic antigenic stimulation. As an example, post-transplantation primary effusion lymphoma may be associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. The role of HHV-8 in the pathogenesis of primary effusion lymphoma is discussed in more detail separately.

In contrast, PTLD accounts for a minority of secondary cancers following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).</p><p>The reported incidence of PTLD varies among transplant centers, likely as a result of different patient populations, allograft types, and immunosuppressive regimens. As will be described in the next section, the risk of PTLD is greatest in patients with marked immunosuppression. This probably explains part of the variability in the incidence of PTLD with different types of transplants. The overall incidence is approximately 1 percent at 10 years, 30 to 50 times higher than in the general population, with a recent trend toward increases in frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>].

In particular, the degree of T cell immunosuppression appears to be more important than the degree of immunosuppression overall, due to the impairment of EBV-specific T cell-mediated immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. EBV-infected B cells are thought to be normally &quot;held in check&quot; by cytotoxic T cells. This defense mechanism is lost when T cell function is impaired, promoting the development of PTLD. (See <a href=\"#H3062230\" class=\"local\">'EBV-positive disease'</a> above.)</p><p>Initial studies in solid organ transplant demonstrated that the risk of developing PTLD increased with the degree of immunosuppression, particularly among pediatric patients and those exposed to certain types of induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/38,39,42,47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39,42,47-51</a>] or prolonged high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/50,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,52-54</a>].

In another report of nine lung transplant recipients with PTLD, eight had isolated intrathoracic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Additional data have emerged demonstrating that the risk of PTLD varies depending on the agents used for immunosuppression. In general, agents that suppress T cell activity appear to be associated with an increased risk of PTLD.

In the absence of the use of OKT3 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) seromismatch (ie, a negative recipient and a positive donor), the incidence rate of PTLD for EBV-seronegative recipients was 24 times higher than that for EBV-seropositive recipients. These patients, who had no preoperative immunity to EBV, usually acquired the infection post-transplant from the donor (approximately 85 percent of whom are EBV-positive). Similar observations have been made in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/43,48,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,48,65</a>]. As an example, upon multivariate analysis in a retrospective study of 276 pediatric kidney transplant recipients, risk factors for PTLD included EBV donor <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/recipient</span> negative status (hazard ratio [HR] 7.7, 95% CI 1.6-35.9) and age less than five years (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. As previously mentioned, PTLD may be more common in children, perhaps because a higher percentage of children is EBV-seronegative prior to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/48,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16930180\"><span class=\"h3\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some additional risk factors for PTLD include a history of pretransplant malignancy and fewer HLA matches. In a retrospective analysis of over 25,000 patients, for example, an increased risk was associated with pretransplant malignancy (HR 3.54), fewer HLA matches (HR 1.32), younger age (HR 1.91), and treatment with ATG (HR 1.55) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. However, specific HLA loci mismatches may confer greater risk. In a single center study of 1013 kidney transplant recipients, one mismatch at HLA-B was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.4 and two HLA-B mismatches with a hazard ratio of 5.1 for PTLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Mismatches at HLA-A and HLA-DR were not independently associated with an increased hazard ratio.</p><p>The risk of PTLD also varies with time post-transplant. This was shown in a retrospective analysis of nearly 90,000 patients placed on the renal transplant wait list over a 10-year period, of which 357 cases of lymphoma developed in transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The first year post-transplant was associated with the highest lymphoma rate. An increased risk was also noted in those under 25 years of age and Caucasians.</p><p>A combination of risk factors markedly enhances the overall risk of PTLD. In the Mayo Clinic series, for example, therapy with OKT3 for rejection and CMV seromismatch (ie, a negative recipient and a positive donor) further increased the risk four- to sixfold above that seen in EBV-seronegative recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The presence of all three risk factors increased the incidence rate of fatal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> central nervous system PTLD by a factor of 654, compared with patients lacking all three factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16931449\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors among HCT recipients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While many risk factors for PTLD are the same among recipients of solid organ transplant and HCT, there are a few risk factors, such as the source of stem cells, specific for HCT recipients.</p><p>The risk of PTLD was assessed in 18,014 bone marrow transplant recipients at 235 centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The cumulative incidence was 1 percent at 10 years, with 82 percent occurring in the first year and the risk being highest at one to five months post-transplant followed by a steep decline (120 versus 5 cases per 10,000 patients per year among survivors for more than one year). The major risk factors for early PTLD in this study were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An unrelated or HLA-mismatched related donor (RR 4.1)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cell depletion of donor marrow (RR 12.7), particularly if natural killer cells were also removed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of antithymocyte globulin (ATG, RR 6.4) or anti-CD3 antibodies (RR 43) for prophylaxis or treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic graft-versus-host disease was the major risk factor for late onset PTLD</p><p/><p>The risk imposed by these factors was additive. The rate of PTLD increased from 8 percent in patients with two major risk factors, to 22 percent in patients with three or more risk factors.</p><p>In a similar study, PTLD occurred in 127 of 26,901 patients (0.47 percent) who underwent allogeneic HCT, with 83 percent of the cases occurring within one year following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Risk factors for development of PTLD included selective T cell depletion, treatment with ATG, unrelated donor or HLA-mismatched donor accompanied by either selective T cell depletion or ATG therapy, and age &ge;50 at the time of HCT. The incidences of PTLD were 0.2, 1.1, 3.6, and 8.1 percent for those with zero, one, two, or &ge;3 risk factors, respectively.</p><p>The source of stem cells may affect the risk of PTLD development. To date there has been little suggestion that the use of T cell replete bone marrow versus peripheral blood progenitor cells affects the risk of second malignancies following transplantation. In contrast, the risk of PTLD may be increased among recipients of umbilical cord blood transplantations. One report using double umbilical cord blood transplantation found 18 second malignancies in 98 patients (18 percent) at a median of 134 days after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Non-specific constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue are common. Other symptoms may be related to viral infection, lymphadenopathy, dysfunction of involved organs, or compression of surrounding structures. Viral symptoms can resemble those seen in acute infectious mononucleosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.) </p><p>More than half of PTLD presents with extranodal masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Involved organs include the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, intestine), lungs, skin, liver, central nervous system, and the allograft itself. More specifically, 20 to 25 percent have central nervous system disease (which is rare in the general population), and a similar proportion have infiltrative lesions in the allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Involvement of the allograft can lead to allograft dysfunction, including renal failure, heart failure, and respiratory dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/55,71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,71-74</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and course of PTLD appear to vary with the origin of the lymphoproliferative cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In one report of 12 renal transplant recipients, lymphoproliferative cells arose from the transplant recipient in eight patients, while lymphoproliferative cells were from the donor in four patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Recipient-origin PTLD presented as multisystem disease at a mean of 76 months after transplantation; five of the eight patients with disease from the recipient died. In contrast, donor-origin PTLD was limited to the allograft, developed after a mean of five months after transplantation, and regressed after reduction of immunosuppression.</p><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative PTLD appears to differ clinically from EBV-related tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/24,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,75,76</a>]. In one study, the clinical presentation and survival of 11 transplant recipients with B cell lymphomas not due to EBV were compared with those of 21 patients with EBV-associated lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Tumors not due to EBV presented much later (6.4 versus 1.5 years post-transplantation), suggesting that their incidence may increase with time. In addition, EBV-negative tumors were much more virulent (median survival of 1 versus 37 months).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17288449\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of EBV viral load</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While many healthy transplant recipients will demonstrate a modestly increased EBV viral load post-transplant, the vast majority of patients with EBV-positive PTLD will demonstrate a more marked elevation in the EBV viral load. As an example, in one study, plasma from patients with PTLD had a median EBV viral load of 3225 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/100</span> microL, while immunosuppressed controls without evidence of PTLD had fewer than 740 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/100</span> microL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. This observation has led to the suggestion that PTLD may be detected early by monitoring the EBV viral load by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of unfractionated whole blood, plasma, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients at high risk of developing this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/77-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-80</a>]. While an increased EBV viral load is suggestive of PTLD, the diagnosis of PTLD is currently made based on the histologic evaluation of a tissue biopsy. Similarly, while the absence of EBV in the peripheral blood makes PTLD less likely, it does not completely exclude the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H27243666\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Many transplant centers have incorporated EBV monitoring into the routine evaluation of patients at high risk for PTLD. Centers differ with regards to their definition of high-risk patients and the cutoff used determining EBV positivity. Due to the use of different methods, EBV viral load measurements cannot be compared between institutions. The optimal primer set, the relative importance of intracellular versus free plasma EBV, and the baseline profile in an organ transplant population remain unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>Since the vast majority of EBV-positive PTLD occurs in the first year after transplantation, it is reasonable to monitor high-risk patients more frequently during the initial post-transplant period and to increase the time span between samples as the time from transplantation increases. The decision to monitor less frequently must be individualized and take into consideration many factors including the type of graft, the degree of ongoing immunosuppression, and the pattern of EBV viral loads to date. Monitoring for an uncomplicated hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipient may begin with screening on the day of transplantation, weekly monitoring for the first three months, followed by monthly monitoring for at least one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In contrast, monitoring for an uncomplicated kidney transplant recipient may begin with screening within the first week after transplant followed by monthly monitoring for the next three to six months and then every three months for the rest of the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>It may be possible to predict the development of PTLD and monitor response to treatment using PCR to detect and quantify serial changes in EBV-DNA levels in plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders/abstract/19,77,85-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,77,85-91</a>].

While the overall incidence of lymphoproliferative disease is approximately 1 percent in the transplant population, the incidence varies dramatically with type of allograft, being lowest among HCT, renal, and liver transplants, higher among heart and lung transplants, and highest among intestinal and multiorgan transplants. (See <a href=\"#H16929638\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) in most patients relates to the outgrowth of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B cell proliferations in the setting of chronic T cell immunosuppression. However, EBV-negative tumors and T cell tumors can also occur. (See <a href=\"#H21103657\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The principal risk factors underlying the development of a PTLD are the degree of overall immunosuppression and the EBV serostatus of the recipient. Additional risk factors include time post-transplant. (See <a href=\"#H16930159\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of patients with PTLD is highly variable and depends at least partially on the type of PTLD and the areas of involvement. Non-specific constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue are common. Other symptoms may be related to viral infection, lymphadenopathy, dysfunction of involved organs, or compression of surrounding structures. More than half of patients with PTLD present with extranodal masses. Involved organs include the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, intestine), lungs, skin, liver, central nervous system, and the allograft itself. (See <a href=\"#H21103671\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three main types of PTLD occur in transplant recipients including polyclonal, morphologically benign lymphoproliferation (early lesions); polyclonal or monoclonal polymorphic B cell proliferations with some features of malignant lymphoma; and monoclonal proliferations, often with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities that meet criteria for B cell or T cell lymphoma seen in immunocompetent patients (both non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin type). (See <a href=\"#H27548826\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An accurate diagnosis of PTLD requires a high index of suspicion. Radiologic evidence of a mass, or elevated serum markers (such as increased lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels) are suggestive of PTLD; positive positron emission tomography (PET) scanning also favors the diagnosis. A tissue biopsy, preferably an excisional biopsy, with review by an expert hematopathologist, is required to ensure an accurate diagnosis. Diagnosis of central nervous system or cardiac lymphoma is particularly difficult.
