Osteoporosis affects more than 75 million people in the United States, Europe, and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the year 2000, there were approximately 9 million osteoporotic fractures worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Prevention of low bone mass and fractures using nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies will be discussed here. The prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and the treatment of established osteoporosis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis may be made in the presence of a fragility fracture, particularly at the spine, hip, wrist, humerus, rib, and pelvis, without measurement of bone mineral density (BMD). Fragility fractures are those occurring from a fall from a standing height or less, without major trauma such as a motor vehicle accident. Certain skeletal locations, including the skull, cervical spine, hands, and feet, are not associated with fragility fractures. Stress fractures are also not considered fragility fractures, as they are due to repetitive injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of a fragility fracture, BMD assessment by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard to diagnose osteoporosis, according to the classification of World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. BMD that is 2.5 standard deviations (SD) or more below the mean BMD of a young-adult reference population, which is a T-score of -2.5 or less, qualifies for a diagnosis of osteoporosis, provided that other causes of low BMD have been ruled out. Low bone mass (osteopenia) is defined as a T-score between -1.0 to -2.5. Individuals with T-scores of &le;-2.5 have the highest risk of fracture. However, there are more fractures in patients with a T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 because there are so many more patients in this category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Assessment of fracture risk'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6228214\"><span class=\"h1\">WHY PREVENTION?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone strength reflects the integration of bone mineral density (BMD) and other properties of bone that are collectively called &quot;bone quality&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. BMD in adults is determined by peak bone mass and the subsequent rate of bone loss. As BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) decreases, fracture risk increases as a continuum, with no &quot;fracture threshold.&quot; In one analysis, for every one standard deviation (SD) decrease in BMD at the hip, there was a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of hip fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, the prevention of low bone mass is directed to maximizing peak bone mass and minimizing the rate of bone loss, with the ultimate goals of maintaining bone strength and preventing fractures. Since most fractures occur with some impact on the bone, preventing falls is another important aspect of preventing fractures, especially in frail patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The statement of Professor Charles E Dent that &quot;senile osteoporosis is a pediatric disease&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] illustrates the importance of achieving the maximum potential peak bone mass, thereby attenuating the effects of bone loss later in life. Preventing bone loss is preferable to treatment once it has occurred because bone microarchitectural changes associated with bone loss are largely irreversible. Treatment may stabilize or increase BMD and reduce the risk of fracture, but it is unlikely to fully restore bone quality and bone strength.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9840736\"><span class=\"h1\">MAXIMIZING PEAK BONE MASS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interventions to optimize peak bone mass and skeletal health should be directed toward a healthy lifestyle during the bone-forming years, particularly adolescence. These can be divided into categories of nutrition, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors. All children, and in particular, adolescents, should have adequate calcium and vitamin D intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71669 \">table 1</a>), engage in regular physical activity, achieve normal body weight, and avoid smoking and alcohol use. Children 9 to 18 years of age should consume approximately 1300 mg of calcium daily, preferably from calcium-rich or calcium-fortified foods. Adequate vitamin D (600 international units) is necessary to promote intestinal calcium absorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-requirements-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium requirements in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Peak bone mass is the maximum bone mass achieved in life. The timing is not known with certainty but probably occurs in the third decade of life in most individuals, with differences in timing due to genetic, hormonal, and environmental variables, the skeletal site measured, and the method of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Environmental factors include diet, exercise, habits (smoking, alcohol use), diseases, and medications. Patients with congenital disorders, such as osteogenesis imperfecta and cystic fibrosis, are now being more successfully managed in childhood, so that more survive and reach adulthood with low bone mass. Chronic inflammatory diseases during childhood and adolescence pose numerous threats to bone health, resulting in either immediate fragility fractures or subsequent fractures in adulthood caused by suboptimal peak bone mass. Peak bone mass acquisition is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoporosis#H341616\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Peak bone mass acquisition'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Good nutrition from infancy through adolescence, with particular attention to adequate daily intake of calcium and vitamin D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71669 \">table 1</a>), is a key component in the attainment of maximum peak bone mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Most children should consume calcium-rich or calcium- and vitamin D-fortified foods to achieve this goal. Routine supplementation of calcium and vitamin D is not necessary for healthy growing children who consume a varied diet. For those unable to achieve adequate intake from diet, we suggest supplementation with calcium and vitamin D. However, the skeletal benefits of calcium and vitamin D supplements have been difficult to demonstrate in clinical trials, which may be due, in part, to the design of the trials. Most trials evaluated short-term supplementation in healthy children who did not have inadequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D. Supplementation is likely to benefit only those children with inadequate intake. In such children, longer-term follow-up is required to show a substantial benefit in bone mineralization and fracture prevention.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials involving over 2800 healthy children, there was a small increase in total body mineral content in children randomly assigned to calcium supplementation (300 to 1200 mg daily for 0.7 to 7 years) rather than placebo (mean difference 0.14, 95% CI 0.01-0.27), but there were no differences in BMD at the femoral neck or lumbar spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some observational studies, serum vitamin D levels were positively associated with bone density in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, in a meta-analysis of six randomized trials involving over 800 healthy children and adolescents, there was no difference in total body bone mineral content or hip, forearm, or lumbar spine BMD in children randomly assigned to vitamin D supplementation or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies have shown that high consumption of carbonated soft drinks may impair bone acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and increase fracture risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] in girls. However, other studies have shown that this effect is largely a matter of displacement of more nutritious beverages and that it may be reversed by taking the recommended daily intake of calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorexia nervosa, an increasingly common eating disorder in female adolescents, is associated with reduced BMD and increased fracture risk.

On the other hand, excessive exercise can be harmful to skeletal health when it is accompanied by poor nutrition and reduced body fat, as seen in adolescents and young adults with female athlete triad (disordered eating, amenorrhea, osteoporosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Cigarette smoking and excess alcohol intake should be discouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In addition, administration of drugs that are known to be harmful to skeletal health, such as glucocorticoids and anticonvulsants, should be avoided or minimized in dose and duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no role for pharmacologic therapy as a means to maximize peak bone mass, except in very special circumstances. As an example, pharmacologic doses of vitamin D for some children on anticonvulsant therapy or with celiac disease may be necessary to optimize skeletal health (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiepileptic-drugs-and-bone-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiepileptic drugs and bone disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'Prevention of bone loss'</a>). In addition, physiologic hormone replacement for deficiency states in children, such as growth hormone deficiency or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, is essential to achieve normal peak bone mass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children#H305216081\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Bone mass'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MINIMIZING BONE LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stabilizing bone mineral density (BMD) or reducing the rate of bone loss is the primary objective in the prevention of osteoporosis once peak bone mass has been attained. We agree with the Surgeon General's Report on Bone Health and Osteoporosis, which recommends a pyramid approach to the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis with a foundation of lifestyle changes that include nutrition, physical activity, and fall prevention; a second tier of addressing drugs and diseases associated with bone loss or osteoporosis; and a third tier of pharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Age-related bone loss begins soon after peak bone mass<strong> </strong>for either sex. In normal women, the annual rates of BMD loss appear to be highest during the one year before through two years after the final menstrual period (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of premenopausal osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Premenopausal bone loss'</a>). A longitudinal study of 620 men and women age 20 to 89 years showed a small bone loss (&lt;0.4 percent per year) at the hip and spine in premenopausal women, with a tripling of the bone loss rate in the early postmenopausal years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A typical rate of bone loss in early postmenopausal, estrogen-deficient women is probably approximately 0.5 to 1.5 percent per year, with a small percentage of women being &quot;rapid bone losers&quot; who may lose as much as 3 to 5 percent of bone mass per year. In men under age 50 years, there was a slow rate of bone loss at the hip, but not the spine, that continued throughout life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Age-related bone loss in older women and men is approximately 0.5 to 1.0 percent per year.</p><p>Factors that influence the rate and magnitude of bone loss include concomitant diseases, hormone concentrations, age, body weight, calcium and vitamin D intake, physical activity, family history, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reported rates of bone loss vary according to the type of study (cross-sectional versus longitudinal), skeletal site, skeletal compartment (trabecular versus cortical), type of measurement, ethnicity, sex, and other confounding factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9841353\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A healthy lifestyle should be encouraged in all adults in order to preserve BMD, bone microarchitecture, and bone strength. A healthy lifestyle includes regular weight-bearing exercise (30 minutes on most days of the week), adequate nutrition (protein, calcium, and vitamin D), smoking cessation, moderate alcohol intake, and fall prevention. In addition, affected patients should avoid, if possible, drugs that increase bone loss, such as glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcium and vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest 800 international units of vitamin D daily and 1200 mg elemental calcium (ideally from diet, plus supplements if needed) daily for most postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/22,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,29,30</a>]. Although the optimal intake (diet plus supplement) has not been clearly established in premenopausal women or in men, 1000 mg of calcium is generally suggested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71669 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin D for children 1 to 18 years and adults through age 70 years is 600 international units (15 mcg) and 800 international units (20 mcg) after age 71 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These suggestions are consistent with the 2010 Institute of Medicine (IOM) Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of calcium and vitamin D supplementation for the primary prevention of fracture in premenopausal women and men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. They recommended against supplementation with &le;400 international units of vitamin D and &le;1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women, and they concluded there was insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms at doses higher than these.</p><p>Calcium and vitamin D are necessary for normal skeletal homeostasis. Vitamin D enhances intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and is important for mineralization of bone, as well as optimal muscle function and balance. Low concentrations of vitamin D are associated with impaired calcium absorption, a negative calcium balance, and a compensatory rise in parathyroid hormone, which results in excessive bone resorption. While it is often difficult to distinguish effects of calcium from vitamin D in clinical trials, some meta-analyses have shown increases in BMD and a reduction in fracture risk in older patients supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis#H1349722\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Benefits of vitamin D repletion'</a>.)</p><p>Older persons confined indoors and other high-risk groups may have low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at the recommended intake level and may require higher intakes. Thus, in patients at very high risk for osteoporosis in whom there is a clinical suspicion that the usual doses of vitamin D are inadequate (malabsorption, decreasing bone mass), measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be necessary to ensure that supplementation is adequate, with the caveat that assay variability may be significant.

Moderation in alcohol intake is appropriate, although patients should not be advised to initiate alcohol drinking to improve skeletal health.

However, some patients with low bone mass are at high risk for fracture and are likely to benefit from pharmacologic therapy to reduce fracture risk. Management decisions should be individualized with consideration of all available clinical information, including the expected benefits and potential risks of drug therapy, as well as patient preferences.</p><p>Since pharmacologic therapy has significant costs and associated risks, pretreatment fracture risk and the expected reduction in fracture risk with therapy should be considered. Individuals with T-scores &le;-2.5 and those with prior osteoporotic fracture are at high risk of fracture and are likely to benefit from pharmacologic therapy to reduce fracture risk. However, most fractures occur in adults with T-scores between -1.0 and -2.5. These patients have a lower fracture risk than those with T-scores &le;-2.5, but because there are so many more patients in this category, the total number of patients with fractures is greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-osteoporosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, selection of patients for pharmacologic therapy should consider an estimation of fracture risk, as determined by a combination of BMD and clinical risk factors.

The management of skeletal health should be directed toward maximizing peak bone mass and minimizing bone loss that occurs with aging and declining sex hormone levels. In general, healthy lifestyle measures should be encouraged for all individuals to preserve bone mineral density (BMD), bone microarchitecture, and bone strength.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthy lifestyle measures for maximizing peak bone mass during the bone-forming years include adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, physical activity (although not excessive), and avoidance of cigarette smoking and alcohol. Recommended calcium intake for children and adolescents 9 to 18 years old is 1300 mg daily, preferably from calcium-rich or calcium-supplemented foods. Adequate vitamin D (600 international units) is necessary to promote intestinal calcium absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71669 \">table 1</a>). Routine supplementation of calcium and vitamin D is not necessary for healthy, growing children who consume a varied diet.

The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin D for adults through age 70 years is 600 international units (15 mcg) and 800 international units (20 mcg) after age 71 years.
