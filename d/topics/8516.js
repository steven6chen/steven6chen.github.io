In people with hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. When this occurs, the body's metabolism is increased, which can cause a variety of symptoms.</p><p>This topic discusses the symptoms, diagnostic tests, and treatment options for HYPERthyroidism. HYPOthyroidism is discussed in a separate topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS THE THYROID?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the middle of the neck, located below the larynx (voice box) and above the clavicles (collarbones) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834 \">figure 1</a>). The thyroid produces two hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), that regulate how the body uses and stores energy (also known as the body's metabolism).</p><p>The thyroid is controlled by a gland in the brain, known as the pituitary. The pituitary produces thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which stimulates the thyroid to produce T3 and T4.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERTHYROIDISM CAUSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Graves' disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is not clear why Graves' disease develops in most people, although it is more common in certain families.</p><p>In people with Graves' disease, the immune system produces an antibody that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. This is most common in women between the ages of 20 and 40 years but can occur at any age in men or women. The thyroid gland enlarges (called a goiter) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58509\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58509 \">figure 2</a>) and makes excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hyperthyroidism symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Some people develop eye problems (called Graves' ophthalmopathy or orbitopathy), which causes dry, irritated, or red eyes and, in severe cases, may cause double vision. Others develop swelling behind or around the eyes that causes the eyes to bulge out or inflammation of muscle in the eyelids that can cause excessive lid opening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58509\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58509 \">figure 2</a>). The more severe manifestations of Graves' eye disease are uncommon, except in smokers. In its most severe form, people with Graves' ophthalmopathy can develop inflammation of the optic nerves, which can result in loss of vision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more thyroid nodules (small growths or lumps in the thyroid gland) can produce too much thyroid hormone. The nodule is then called a hot nodule, toxic nodule, or, when there is more than one, a toxic nodular goiter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-nodules-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Thyroid nodules (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painless (&quot;silent or lymphocytic&quot;) thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis are disorders in which the thyroid becomes temporarily inflamed and releases thyroid hormone into the bloodstream, causing hyperthyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Postpartum thyroiditis can occur several months after delivery. The hyperthyroid symptoms may last for several months, often followed by several months of hypothyroid symptoms, such as fatigue, muscle cramps, bloating, and weight gain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute (granulomatous) thyroiditis is thought to be caused by a virus. It causes a painful, tender, enlarged thyroid gland. The thyroid becomes inflamed and releases thyroid hormone into the blood stream; the hyperthyroidism resolves when the viral infection improves and may also be followed by several months of hypothyroid symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking too much thyroid hormone medication for hypothyroidism increases blood levels into the range seen in patients with hyperthyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERTHYROIDISM SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with hyperthyroidism have symptoms, including one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety, irritability, trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness (in particular of the upper arms and thighs, making it difficult to lift heavy items or climb stairs or get up from a chair)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tremors (of the hands)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perspiring more than normal, difficulty tolerating hot weather</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid, forceful, or irregular heartbeats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss in spite of a normal or increased appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent bowel movements</p><p/><p>In addition, some women have irregular menstrual periods or stop having their periods altogether. This can be associated with infertility. Men may develop enlarged or tender breasts or erectile dysfunction, which resolves when hyperthyroidism is treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERTHYROIDISM DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperthyroidism can be diagnosed with blood tests that measure the amount of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Typically, the thyroid hormone level is high, and the TSH level is low. A thyroid scan or a blood test may also be recommended to help determine the cause of hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease, toxic nodular goiter, or thyroiditis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERTHYROIDISM TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperthyroidism can be treated using medicine, radioiodine, or surgery. Many factors, such as your age and the severity and type of hyperthyroidism, as well as your preferences, are important in determining which treatment is best.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two main types of medicines used to treat hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs and beta blockers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithyroid-drugs-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Antithyroid drugs (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Antithyroid drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antithyroid drugs, such as methimazole (MMI or Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU), work by decreasing how much thyroid hormone the body makes. Both are very effective, but MMI is preferred because of a greater risk of serious side effects with PTU. Carbimazole is similar to MMI and is used in many countries but not in the United States.</p><p>Because MMI can be associated with serious birth defects for pregnant women, PTU is the preferred drug during the first trimester, although PTU can also be associated with birth defects, but they are less serious. For hyperthyroidism presenting after the first trimester, MMI is preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithyroid-drugs-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Antithyroid drugs (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These medications can be used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a short-term (four to eight weeks) treatment in people with Graves' disease or toxic nodular goiter, before treatment with radioiodine or surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As one to two years treatment for Graves' disease to see if a remission occurs. The disease goes into remission in approximately 30 percent of people, and antithyroid drugs can be used to control hyperthyroidism while waiting to see if remission occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As long-term treatment in patients who do not go into remission and prefer to avoid radioiodine or surgery.</p><p/><p>People who have very mild Graves' disease may have as high as a 50 to 70 percent chance of remission. It is possible to have a relapse years later, and some people will need to eventually consider permanent treatment with radioactive iodine or surgery.</p><p>Antithyroid drugs have some minor side effects, such as rash, hives, painful joints, fever, and stomach upset. A more serious complication called agranulocytosis (lack of white blood cells) can occur, but this is very rare. Patients taking antithyroid drugs should notify their clinician immediately if they get a sore throat, fever, or any signs of a bacterial infection. PTU has rarely been linked with liver failure.</p><p>While taking antithyroid drugs, you will have a blood test for thyroid hormone every four to six weeks until your hyperthyroidism is under control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockers, such as atenolol or propranolol, are often started as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made. While beta blockers do not reduce thyroid hormone production, they can control many of the bothersome symptoms, such as rapid heart rate, tremors, anxiety, and heat intolerance. Once the hyperthyroidism is under control (with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioactive iodine), the beta blocker is stopped.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Radioactive iodine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Destroying the thyroid with radioiodine, called ablation, is a permanent way to treat hyperthyroidism. The amount of radiation used is small and does not cause cancer, infertility, or birth defects. This is the most widely used treatment for hyperthyroidism in the United States.</p><p>Radioiodine is given in liquid or capsule form, and it works by destroying much of the thyroid tissue. This takes approximately 6 to 18 weeks. People with severe symptoms, older adults, and people with heart problems should first be treated with an antithyroid drug to control symptoms. Most people who take radioiodine develop hypothyroidism and will need to take thyroid hormone supplements for the rest of their lives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with most treatments, there are some risks with radioactive iodine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sometimes, after apparently successful treatment, the condition returns, and further treatment is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 10 to 20 percent of people who use radioiodine treatment require a second dose. These people usually have severe hyperthyroidism or a very large goiter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twice as many patients who receive radioiodine experience worsening of their eye disease compared with patients who have surgery.</p><p/><p>People who are treated with radioiodine should avoid close physical contact, especially with young children and pregnant women, for three to seven days after treatment because of the possibility of exposing them to low doses of radiation. This can be difficult for parents of young children.</p><p>You will need to see your doctor or nurse on a regular basis after treatment to have your thyroid hormone levels checked and monitor for hypothyroidism or recurrent hyperthyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although surgical removal of the thyroid is a permanent cure for hyperthyroidism, it is used far less often than antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine because of the risks (and expense) associated with thyroid surgery. The risks include damage to the nerves of the voice box and parathyroid glands, which regulate the body's calcium balance.</p><p>However, surgery is recommended when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large goiter blocks the airways, making it difficult to breathe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You cannot tolerate antithyroid drugs and you do not want to use radioiodine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a nodule in the thyroid gland that could be cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have active Graves' eye disease</p><p/><p>The follow-up after surgery includes regular appointments to test your thyroid hormone levels and monitor for signs of hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Most people develop hypothyroidism after surgery and require treatment with thyroid hormone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY AND HYPERTHYROIDISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who take antithyroid drugs and want to become pregnant should discuss this with their doctor or nurse. There are risks to the mother and developing baby if hyperthyroidism is not well controlled; these risks can be avoided or minimized with frequent monitoring and medication adjustment throughout the pregnancy.</p><p>Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not be treated with radioactive iodine. Having radioactive iodine treatment or surgery before becoming pregnant <strong>usually</strong> eliminates the need for antithyroid drugs and any possible associated risks. A woman should wait at least six months after radioactive iodine treatment before trying to become pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=2178\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
