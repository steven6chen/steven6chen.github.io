Hypoglycemia and weight gain associated with many antidiabetic medications may interfere with the implementation and long-term application of &quot;intensive&quot; therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Current treatments have centered on increasing insulin availability (either through direct insulin administration or through agents that promote insulin secretion), improving sensitivity to insulin, delaying the delivery and absorption of carbohydrate from the gastrointestinal tract, or increasing urinary glucose excretion.</p><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies (eg, GLP-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitors) affect glucose control through several mechanisms, including enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, slowed gastric emptying, and reduction of postprandial glucagon and of food intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51832 \">table 1</a>). These agents do not usually cause hypoglycemia in the absence of therapies that otherwise cause hypoglycemia.</p><p>This topic will review the mechanism of action and therapeutic utility of GLP-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. DPP-4 inhibitors are discussed separately. A general discussion of the initial management of blood glucose and the management of persistent hyperglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes is also presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-dpp-4-inhibitors-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose homeostasis is dependent upon a complex interplay of multiple hormones: insulin and amylin, produced by pancreatic beta cells; glucagon, produced by pancreatic alpha cells; and gastrointestinal peptides, including GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP; gastric inhibitory polypeptide) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59551 \">figure 1</a>). Abnormal regulation of these substances may contribute to the clinical presentation of diabetes. The role of GLP-1 in glucose homeostasis is illustrative of the incretin effect, in which oral glucose has a greater stimulatory effect on insulin secretion than intravenous glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This effect is mediated by several gastrointestinal peptides, particularly GLP-1, that are released in the setting of a meal and stimulate insulin synthesis and insulin secretion, which does not occur when carbohydrate is administered intravenously.</p><p>GLP-1 is produced from the proglucagon gene in L-cells of the small intestine and is secreted in response to nutrients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59551 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. GLP-1 binds to a specific GLP-1 receptor, which is expressed in various tissues, including pancreatic beta cells, pancreatic ducts, gastric mucosa, kidney, lung, heart, skin, immune cells, and the hypothalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. GLP-1 exerts its main effect by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin release from the pancreatic islets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It has also been shown to slow gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], inhibit inappropriate post-meal glucagon release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>], and reduce food intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51832 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Owing in part to the effects of GLP-1 on slowed gastric emptying and appetite centers in the brain, therapy with GLP-1 and its receptor agonists is associated with weight loss, even among patients without significant nausea and vomiting. (See <a href=\"#H1201791\" class=\"local\">'Weight loss'</a> below.)</p><p>In animal models, GLP-1 stimulates beta-cell proliferation and differentiation, preventing diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Exenatide</a>, like GLP-1, has been shown to promote beta-cell regeneration and differentiation in prediabetic and diabetic rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Although GLP-1 may hold promise for halting the progression of beta-cell failure that often occurs in type 2 diabetes, the animal model findings have not been replicated in humans. Moreover, after GLP-1 receptor agonists are stopped, their glucose-lowering effectiveness dissipates rapidly, belying their proposed trophic effects on beta cells.</p><p>In patients with type 2 diabetes, there is an impaired insulin response to GLP-1, possibly related to a reduction in postprandial GLP-1 secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59286%7EPC%2F72099%7EPC%2F81642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59286 graphicRef72099 graphicRef81642 \">figure 2A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] or to other mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. GLP-1 regulation may also be abnormal in type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The role of GLP-1 in the treatment of type 1 diabetes is under investigation but is not well defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. We do not currently use GLP-1-based therapies in patients with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, this discussion will be limited to its use in type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 exhibits a short half-life of one to two minutes due to N-terminal degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). This necessitates continuous infusion of GLP-1 to achieve steady-state levels in pharmacologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Research has focused on GLP-1-like agonists that are resistant to DPP-4 degradation and on agents that increase GLP-1 via inhibition of DPP-4.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201411\"><span class=\"h1\">GLP-1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synthetic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are resistant to degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and therefore have a longer half-life, facilitating clinical use. They bind to the GLP-1 receptor and stimulate glucose-dependent insulin release from the pancreatic islets as described above. They do not usually cause hypoglycemia in the absence of therapies that otherwise cause hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Glucagon-like peptide-1'</a> above.)</p><p>Although synthetic GLP-1 receptor agonists improve glycemic control, there are few studies assessing clinically important health outcomes (cardiovascular events, mortality), durability of glucose control or weight loss, or safety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1201477\"><span class=\"h2\">Glycemic efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective in improving glycemic control, as illustrated by the findings of a meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials comparing GLP-1 receptor agonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exenatide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liraglutide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albiglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albiglutide</a>, taspoglutide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lixisenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lixisenatide</a>) with placebo or an active comparator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a>, DPP-4 inhibitor, thiazolidinedione, sulfonylurea) in patients with type 2 diabetes and suboptimal control on one or two oral agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sulfonylurea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The duration of the individual trials ranged from 8 to 30 weeks. In comparison with placebo, all GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced glycated hemoglobin (A1C) by approximately 1 percentage point (treatment difference 0.47 to 1.56 percent).</p><p>Although there have been no completed comparative effectiveness studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], meta-analysis of the usually short-term (26-week) pharmaceutical company-supported studies has suggested that GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy in patients with baseline A1C levels of 8 to 8.5 percent may lower A1C modestly more (by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points) than the active comparators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. They do so at the expense of substantially higher gastrointestinal side effects and cost. The comparison with other injectable therapy, insulin, is particularly problematic as the intensity of insulin therapy in the comparison group is questionable. In a post-hoc analysis of two 26-week trials comparing insulin with GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with baseline mean A1C of 8.3 percent, the slightly lower A1C reduction (approximately 0.2 percentage points) with GLP-1 receptor agonists was accompanied by an approximately 3 kg difference in weight at study end, as reported in many studies with GLP-1 receptor agonists, but balanced by a substantial increase in gastrointestinal side effects (14 versus 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Moreover, the frequency of major hypoglycemia in the two studies, albeit quite low, was nominally greater in the GLP-1 receptor agonist than in the insulin treatment groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Future studies comparing these agents with insulin should include dedicated, independent glucose <span class=\"nowrap\">monitoring/insulin</span> titration committees to oversee appropriate insulin titration and vigorously analyze reasons for lack of titration.</p><p>The individual drugs and adverse effects are discussed below.

Therefore, there are few data on CVD safety or putative benefits in lower-risk patients.</p><p>In patients with type 2 diabetes and CVD, there was a reduction in CVD outcomes with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liraglutide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=semaglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">semaglutide</a> compared with placebo, whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lixisenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lixisenatide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exenatide</a> did not increase or decrease CVD outcomes.

Treatment with liraglutide was associated with better glycemic control, a reduction in the use of oral hypoglycemic agents, and a reduction in systolic blood pressure. The side effects were similar to those found in previous studies of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy in diabetes with a three- to sixfold increase in gastrointestinal side effects. Nausea developed in 32.7, 31.4, and 13.7 percent of the participants assigned to 3 mg, 1.8 mg, and placebo, respectively.

They affect glucose control through several mechanisms, including enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, slowed gastric emptying, regulation of postprandial glucagon, and reduction of food intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51832 \">table 1</a>). They do not usually cause hypoglycemia in the absence of therapies that otherwise cause hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Glucagon-like peptide-1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GLP-1 receptor agonists are not considered as initial therapy for the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H5743095\" class=\"local\">'Candidates'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H26275125\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Choice of initial therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who fail initial therapy, there are a number of agents that are available and can be used with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>. The choice of therapy should be individualized based upon patient characteristics, preferences, and costs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Treatment options'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">GLP-1 receptor agonists can be prescribed in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> another oral agent) for patients who fail initial therapy with one or two oral agents, particularly when weight loss or avoidance of hypoglycemia is a primary consideration, the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) level is close to target (within 1 to 1.5 percentage points), and cost is not a major barrier. A prior history of myocardial infarction or stroke might also favor choosing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liraglutide</a> as the second drug to be added to metformin. (See <a href=\"#H5743095\" class=\"local\">'Candidates'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Treatment options'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The exact role for GLP-1 receptor agonists among the myriad of other agents for management of type 2 diabetes is unclear. With long-term use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, weight loss can be substantial in a small fraction of treated patients and associated with other metabolic benefits. By comparison, insulin therapy generally requires only one injection and may be less expensive but is accompanied by hypoglycemia, albeit usually not severe, and weight gain. There are few long-term studies of GLP-1 receptor agonists to assess clinically important health outcomes (cardiovascular events, mortality), durability of glucose control or weight loss, or safety. Many questions remain unanswered regarding clinical use in type 2 diabetes, including long-term benefits and risks and their role in combination with other diabetes medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a decision has been made to use a GLP-1 receptor agonist, we prefer long- rather than short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. This is predominantly due to patient convenience. Among the long-acting agents, patient preference and payer coverage are important considerations in selecting an agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the setting of a prior myocardial infarction or stroke, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liraglutide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=semaglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">semaglutide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) based on the respective cardiovascular outcomes study results. It is unclear whether the progression of retinopathy seen in the semaglutide study is a direct effect of the drug or a consequence of rapid glycemic control similar to that&nbsp;seen in other settings. If semaglutide is prescribed to a patient with a history of diabetic retinopathy, consideration should be given to slower titration to avoid rapid declines in A1C and retinal screening within six months of drug initiation to detect progression of retinopathy. (See <a href=\"#H5743187\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-term studies using twice-daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exenatide</a>, daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lixisenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lixisenatide</a>, daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liraglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liraglutide</a>, or weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albiglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albiglutide</a> in combination with basal insulin (detemir and glargine) have demonstrated safety and efficacy. The addition of a GLP-1 agonist to basal insulin allows for achievement of glycemic targets at reduced insulin dose and amelioration of insulin-induced weight gain. However, the added benefit with regard to A1C lowering is very modest (usually &lt;0.5 percent) and adds substantial expense as well as a second injection. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Exenatide twice daily'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4139967237\" class=\"local\">'Lixisenatide'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Liraglutide'</a> above and <a href=\"#H865626\" class=\"local\">'Albiglutide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are inadequate data to support the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in combination with prandial insulin. Combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors does not provide additive glucose-lowering effects, and thus, the combination should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H5743095\" class=\"local\">'Candidates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The side effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists are predominantly gastrointestinal, particularly nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and occur consistently in trials in 10 to 50 percent of patients. The risk of hypoglycemia is small. Hypoglycemic events may occur, however, when GLP-1 receptor agonists are given in conjunction with diabetes medications known to cause hypoglycemia (eg, insulin, sulfonylureas, glinides).
