However, renal artery stenosis is the primary cause of hypertension (ie, renovascular hypertension) only in certain settings. </p><p>In most cases of renal artery stenosis, one kidney is affected with the second kidney being essentially normal, hence the designation &quot;unilateral&quot; disease. Individuals with high-grade stenosis to both kidneys, or to a solitary functioning kidney thereby affecting the entire functioning renal mass, are considered to have &quot;bilateral&quot; disease. Bilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary functioning kidney, merits specific consideration because of its additional contribution to fluid retention, loss of kidney function, and congestive heart failure. </p><p>The treatment of bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (or stenosis of a solitary functioning kidney) will be reviewed here. Clinical clues suggesting the presence of renovascular hypertension and establishing the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, treatment of unilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, issues related to chronic kidney disease associated with atherosclerotic renovascular disease, and diagnosis and treatment of fibromuscular disease are presented in detail elsewhere.

These findings are used clinically to determine which patients should be evaluated for renovascular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56130\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56130 \">table 1</a>). In addition, bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis or unilateral disease in a single viable kidney can be associated with progressive renal dysfunction (called chronic ischemic renovascular disease or &quot;ischemic nephropathy&quot;).

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A recent or rapid development of severe hypertension. This finding is relatively specific for renovascular hypertension and is the strongest predictor of antihypertensive benefit from revascularization. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rapid rise in arterial pressure associated with sudden development of left ventricular failure (occasionally referred to as &quot;flash pulmonary edema&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis-or-stenosis-to-a-solitary-functioning-kidney/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This finding is more common with bilateral as compared with unilateral renal artery stenosis because bilateral disease is also associated with diuretic resistance and sympathetic adrenergic activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis-or-stenosis-to-a-solitary-functioning-kidney/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly changing serum creatinine levels, particularly following administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).

Both of these factors contribute to the ensuing rise in blood pressure. As a result, combination therapy with a diuretic plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) can control the hypertension in most patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis and is likely to be more effective than other antihypertensive therapy. In a Canadian cohort study, for example, patients with renal artery stenosis who were prescribed ACE inhibitors were significantly less likely to die or have a myocardial infarction or stroke (10 versus 13 events per 100 patient-years) as compared with similar patients prescribed other therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis-or-stenosis-to-a-solitary-functioning-kidney/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. ACE inhibitor therapy was also associated with a lower risk of end-stage renal disease but a higher risk of acute kidney injury (1.2 versus 0.6 events per 100 patient-years). </p><p>Acute kidney injury, which is hemodynamically mediated, is the major limitation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Because of the stenotic lesion, lowering the systemic blood pressure is more likely to reduce the renal perfusion and intraglomerular pressure below the limits of autoregulation; this will tend to lower the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63192\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63192 \">figure 1</a>). The usual autoregulatory response in this setting includes an increase in efferent (postcapillary) arteriolar resistance, which is mediated in part by angiotensin II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis-or-stenosis-to-a-solitary-functioning-kidney/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Blocking the action of angiotensin II with an ACE inhibitor or ARB blunts this autoregulatory response and tends to reduce the GFR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57043\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57043 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis-or-stenosis-to-a-solitary-functioning-kidney/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This effect is more pronounced in patients with diuretic-induced volume depletion since the hypovolemia induces an increase in angiotensin II; the GFR in such settings is more angiotensin II dependent than in patients without hypovolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis-or-stenosis-to-a-solitary-functioning-kidney/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-effects-of-ace-inhibitors-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal effects of ACE inhibitors in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The net effect is that therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB in some patients with significant bilateral renal artery stenosis can produce a rise in the serum creatinine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis-or-stenosis-to-a-solitary-functioning-kidney/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]; this may also occur in some patients with less severe bilateral disease. However, these observations do <strong>not</strong> mean that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated in this disorder as long as the patient is carefully monitored. The decline in GFR is small in most patients; a large increase in the serum creatinine concentration (by more than 30 percent above the previous baseline value) occurs in less than 5 to 10 percent of cases, and the majority of patients (78 percent in one series) with severe bilateral stenosis can tolerate an ACE inhibitor or ARB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bilateral-atherosclerotic-renal-artery-stenosis-or-stenosis-to-a-solitary-functioning-kidney/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Individuals with high-grade stenosis to both kidneys, or to a solitary functioning kidney thereby affecting the entire functioning renal mass, are considered to have &quot;bilateral&quot; disease. Bilateral renal artery stenosis, or stenosis to a solitary functioning kidney, merits specific consideration because of its additional contribution to fluid retention, loss of kidney function, and congestive heart failure.
