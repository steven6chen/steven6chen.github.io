As an example, an incidental renal lesion measuring &gt;1 cm was noted in 14 percent (433 of 3001) of asymptomatic adults (1667 women, 1334 men; mean age 57 years) undergoing an abdominopelvic CT for screening colonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Despite this high incidence, mortality rates from RCC have remained stable or decreased slightly in developed countries.</p><p>SRMs represent a heterogeneous group of lesions that range from benign masses and cysts to indolent and aggressive malignancies. SRMs and complex cystic masses (typically with a solid enhancing component) are more likely to be malignant and warrant further evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H4136046574\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The initial evaluation, differential diagnosis, diagnostic approach, and treatment of SRMs will be reviewed here. The approach outlined in this topic is consistent with guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The evaluation of RCC in general and renal cysts are discussed separately.

While the majority of SRMs are malignant, a significant proportion are benign tumors, and only a small proportion are aggressive malignancies. </p><p>Increasing tumor size and male gender are the best predictors of malignancy, increasing tumor grade, and higher pathologic stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For SRMs &lt;2 cm, 20 to 40 percent are benign tumors, less than 10 percent are high-grade renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and less than 1 percent will present with or develop metastatic RCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F87865\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87865 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In contrast, for renal masses &ge;4 cm, only 5 to 10 percent are benign, and upwards of 20 to 30 percent are high grade or have advanced RCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Women have an approximately two- to threefold increased likelihood of benign pathology compared with men with comparably sized tumors, although the majority of SRMs in women are malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Central tumor location may also indicate a higher risk of malignancy or aggressive behavior, but this finding has not been rigorously established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Put in context, a woman with a peripherally located renal mass less than 3 cm has only a 65 percent chance of having RCC and a less than 10 percent risk of harboring unfavorable pathology; a man with a centrally located renal mass 3 to 4 cm has a 90 percent risk of RCC and a 35 percent risk of unfavorable pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>While male gender, tumor size, and tumor location have implications for diagnosis, tumor histology, and pathology, there are no clinical or radiographic features of solid or complex cystic masses that accurately predict biologic behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061683449\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of most SRMs is one of very slow progression. A meta-analysis that incorporated retrospective data from 234 lesions in 11 series demonstrated an average growth rate of only 0.28 cm per year for suspicious renal masses on observation, mostly SRMs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Prospective active surveillance programs confirm slow growth rates (on the order of 0.1 cm per year) and exceedingly low rates of metastatic progression (&lt;1 percent in two to three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>However, these favorable outcomes likely reflect a selection bias for small tumors and comorbid patients and represent limited follow-up in most series (mean 30 months), and long-term local and metastatic recurrence-free survival rates are excellent regardless of the management strategy selected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>].

The major subclassifications of RCC include, but are not limited to, clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe; each subtype has distinct morphologic appearance, clinical characteristics, and prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Clear cell RCC is the most common histology (approximately 55 percent of SRMs), followed by papillary (20 percent) and chromophobe (5 percent) RCC. Clear cell RCCs have a variable prognosis, determined by stage and grade. Papillary and chromophobe RCCs &lt;4 cm generally demonstrate an indolent course and have a better prognosis than clear cell tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/15,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2656484486\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign renal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SRMs can also represent benign renal lesions, which are more common in women and for smaller tumors. In a single-institution experience, 311 of 2675 surgically resected tumors were benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

RCC, particularly the clear cell subtype, can contain microscopic fat, but this can be reliably distinguished from macroscopic fat, designated fat-poor angiomyolipoma, on imaging. Small angiomyolipomas with minimal fat are difficult to characterize on imaging and generally require further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Patients with tuberous sclerosis also have an increased frequency of RCC, as approximately 1 to 2 percent will develop this malignancy; hence, surveillance for RCC should be considered in this population. Renal imaging in this setting is also needed to follow the progress of the angiomyolipomas, which are at a low but increased risk for hemorrhage as they grow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

Although many cases are initially identified incidentally, some patients present with pain, hematuria, or a palpable mass. Metanephric adenomas are defined by a characteristic histology but may be difficult to distinguish from papillary RCC or epithelial predominant Wilms tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Approximately 90 percent of metanephric adenomas contain a <em>BRAF</em> V600 mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H668296387\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metastatic cancer to the kidney most often presents with multiple renal lesions with borderline enhancement and widespread metastatic disease. However, in patients with a history of a nonrenal cancer, a solitary lesion in the kidney may represent metastatic disease or a primary renal tumor. In a series of 2340 patients with a primary nonrenal cancer, 36 (1.5 percent) had a renal lesion concomitantly diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Of these, 21 (58 percent) were due to metastatic disease to the kidney; in the remaining 15 (42 percent), there was a concomitant RCC.

Renal lymphoma should be suspected in patients with massive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy in other regions of the body or in atypical regions within the retroperitoneum.

Each management strategy has a unique profile of potential serious harms and risks, including deterioration of renal function. </p><p>The oncologic risk or likelihood of death from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is determined by tumor size and stage, and is essentially equivalent for SRMs among management strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The risk of death from competing causes is primarily determined by age and competing risk comorbidities (particularly cardiovascular disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-differential-diagnosis-and-management-of-a-small-renal-mass/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; Partial nephrectomy is generally preferred over radical nephrectomy, particularly for those with compromised renal function or those at risk for future impairment of renal function.
