After some types of cancer treatment, women can have trouble getting pregnant. &quot;Preserving fertility after cancer treatment&quot; involves doing things before or during cancer treatment to raise a woman's chances of getting pregnant later on.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365778044\"><span class=\"h1\">Which cancer treatments can cause fertility problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer treatments that can cause fertility problems include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation involves getting high doses of X-rays.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; If a woman's ovaries (female sex organs) are removed, she can't get pregnant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). If a woman's uterus is removed, she can't carry a pregnancy.</p><p/><p>Chemotherapy and radiation can damage or destroy eggs in the ovaries. As a result, women might stop having periods or have irregular periods. Also, radiation can damage the uterus, which can make it hard to carry a pregnancy.</p><p>Not everyone who gets chemotherapy or radiation will have fertility problems. With chemotherapy, it depends on the medicine and dose a person gets. With radiation, it depends on the dose and part of the body treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199021106\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I want to get pregnant someday?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should let your doctor know <strong>before</strong> you start your cancer treatment. In some cases, treatment that has a lower chance of affecting future fertility might be available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199021121\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there other ways to preserve fertility?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Different things can be done to help women preserve their fertility.</p><p>If you are getting chemotherapy, options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embryo banking &ndash; This involves collecting eggs before you start cancer treatment. A doctor fertilizes the eggs with sperm in a lab to make embryos. An embryo is a group of cells that grow after a woman's egg and a man's sperm join together. The embryos can then be frozen and stored until they are used later on.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freezing and storing eggs (that are not fertilized) or tissue from your ovaries</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines to keep your ovaries from working as well during your cancer treatment</p><p/><p>If you are getting radiation, options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shielding the ovaries or uterus during radiation treatment &ndash; This involves wearing a special shield on the outside of your body during radiation treatment. The shield covers and protects your organs, so they aren't damaged by the radiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moving your ovaries &ndash; If your ovaries are in the path of the radiation, your doctor can perform surgery to move them slightly to keep them from getting damaged.</p><p/><p>If you are going through both chemotherapy and radiation, all of the above might be options for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199021136\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide which option is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to preserve your fertility depends on your cancer, treatment, age, and individual situation. Talk with your doctor about your different choices. To make your decision, you might want to think about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits and downsides of the choices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long they take &ndash; For example, embryo banking takes a few weeks. This could delay the start of your cancer treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well your doctor thinks they will work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much they cost &ndash; For example, it costs money to collect, freeze, and store embryos. Health insurance sometimes pays for these things.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199021153\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I still can't get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you still can't get pregnant after cancer treatment, you have other choices:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You and your partner can try to have a baby using a donated egg.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can have another woman (called a &quot;surrogate&quot;) carry a pregnancy for you.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You might choose to adopt.</p><p/><p>Couples can have a tough time making these decisions. You might find it helpful to talk to a counselor or go to a support group for people who are facing the same issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H199021170\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uterine cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cervical cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysterectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hysterectomy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=absent-or-irregular-periods-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaginal cancer (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-cancer-treatment-after-surgery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Endometrial cancer treatment after surgery (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-line-medical-treatment-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: First-line medical treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-women-with-early-stage-cervical-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fertility preservation in women with early-stage cervical cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
