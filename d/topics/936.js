Airway obstruction, resulting in sleep-disordered breathing or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and recurrent infection are the most common indications for adenotonsillectomy. Forty years ago, the majority of tonsillectomies were performed for infection, while OSA is now the most common indication, accounting for over 75 percent of cases.</p><p>The following features make airway management for adenotonsillectomy particularly challenging:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The airway is shared between the anesthesiologist and the surgeon and must be protected from blood and secretions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of laryngospasm is higher than during other surgical procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who undergo the procedure for OSA are at particularly<strong> high risk </strong>of significant respiratory complications in the postoperative period.</p><p/><p>This topic will discuss the anesthetic management of children who undergo tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy, as well as the management of the child with a hemorrhage after tonsillectomy.

Upper respiratory infections (URIs) are common in children presenting for adenotonsillectomy and may affect the timing of surgery, as recent URI increases the risk of perioperative adverse respiratory events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

There is wide variability in anesthetic management for tonsillectomy. The following is our approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Premedication</strong> &ndash; For most children undergoing tonsillectomy, we use distraction techniques (eg, videos, songs, mobile computing devices) and parental presence during induction of anesthesia rather than premedication with anxiolytics. The goal is to calm the child while avoiding the sedative and respiratory depressant effects of anxiolytics. (See <a href=\"#H27777705\" class=\"local\">'Preparation for anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Induction technique</strong> &ndash; For young children (&le;6 years of age) without severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), we perform inhalational induction of anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>. For older children (&ge;12 years of age), we prefer intravenous (IV) induction to allow more rapid induction and airway control. For children between 6 and 12 years of age, the induction technique depends on the child's level of anxiety and ability to tolerate IV placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For children of any age with severe OSA, or for children with multiple risk factors for perioperative respiratory adverse events (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99883 \">table 1</a>), we prefer an IV induction whenever possible. If inhalational induction is necessary for these children, IV access should be obtained as soon after induction as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Propofol</a> is the preferred IV agent for hemodynamically stable patients. We routinely apply topical local anesthetic prior to IV placement. (See <a href=\"#H27777859\" class=\"local\">'Induction of anesthesia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-anesthetics-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical anesthetics in children&quot;, section on 'EMLA'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Airway management</strong> &ndash; We prefer a cuffed endotracheal tube (even in very young children) rather than an uncuffed endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway for airway management in order to protect the airway from bleeding, secretions, and the risk of fire with the use of electrocautery. (See <a href=\"#H27778222\" class=\"local\">'Choice of airway device'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs)</strong> &ndash; For most children, especially younger children, we routinely intubate without the use of NMBAs. (See <a href=\"#H27778086\" class=\"local\">'NMBAs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maintenance of anesthesia</strong> &ndash; We maintain anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> and a low concentration of inspired oxygen (25 to 30 percent). (See <a href=\"#H27778540\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Analgesia</strong> &ndash; We use a multimodal approach to pain control, which includes prophylaxis with intraoperative IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> as well as an intraoperative dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> (0.1 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, maximum of 4 mg), usually in combination with a low-dose opioid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV). (See <a href=\"#H27779106\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antiemetics</strong> &ndash; PONV is decreased by the use of intraoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> along with a serotonergic antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ondansetron</a> 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, maximum of 4 mg). (See <a href=\"#H27778626\" class=\"local\">'Antiemetics'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Emergence</strong> &ndash; After thorough suctioning of the oropharynx, we extubate in the operating room when the patient is awake and able to protect the airway. (See <a href=\"#H27780610\" class=\"local\">'Emergence from anesthesia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27777705\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation for anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the induction of anesthesia, patient care focuses on the reduction of anxiety, the initiation of analgesics, and proper patient positioning:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduction of anxiety</strong> &ndash; While anxiolytic premedication is often administered prior to anesthesia, we avoid it for children with sleep apnea undergoing adenotonsillectomy whenever possible. Often, distraction techniques (eg, toys, videos, tablet computers, virtual reality devices, music, stickers, and parental presence during induction of anesthesia) may be used in place of anxiolytic medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The benefits of preoperative anxiolysis and sedation have to be balanced with the risk of excessive postoperative sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] and respiratory complications, especially in children with significant OSA. Children with OSA should be monitored with continuous pulse oximetry when premedication is administered. Residual effects of the premedication may persist, especially after a relatively short surgical procedure such as tonsillectomy, and may potentially exacerbate postoperative respiratory complications and sedation, as well as prolong recovery room stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Analgesics</strong> &ndash; Nonopioid analgesics may be administered preoperatively or intraoperatively as part of a multimodal plan for perioperative pain management. The goal of preoperative administration is to ensure that an adequate blood level of the drug is achieved by the end of the procedure. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Acetaminophen</a> may be administered by the oral route preoperatively or by the IV or rectal route intraoperatively after induction, with the dose based on weight or age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of pain in children&quot;, section on 'Acetaminophen'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective at reducing the dose of opioid required for postoperative pain control, but they may increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore, NSAIDs should only be administered in consultation with the surgeon and are <strong>not</strong> usually administered preoperatively or intraoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H27779596\" class=\"local\">'Nonopioid analgesics'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positioning</strong> &ndash; Tonsillectomy is performed in a standard supine position with the neck extended. The head and neck should be positioned carefully for intubation and surgery. This is particularly important for children with Down syndrome, who have a high incidence of atlantoaxial instability, often without symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-preoperative-evaluation-and-care#H18313992\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in children: Preoperative evaluation and care&quot;, section on 'Anatomic assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Management&quot;, section on 'Atlantoaxial instability'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27777859\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhalation induction of anesthesia is commonly performed for very young children to avoid the trauma of IV catheter placement while awake. However, IV induction is preferred for children at high risk of airway complications during induction (eg, severe OSA, uncontrolled asthma, recent upper respiratory infection, craniofacial abnormalities) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99883 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Inhalational anesthetic agents reduce pharyngeal muscular tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], increase airway closing pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and cause failure of coordination of phasic activation of upper airway muscles with diaphragmatic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], all of which may result in airway collapse and obstruction prior to placement of an airway device. In addition, the lower lung volumes caused by general anesthesia lead to a cephalad displacement of the mediastinum, decreasing the longitudinal tension of the upper airway and increasing susceptibility to airway collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These effects are more significant in children with OSA and craniofacial abnormalities.</p><p>Laryngospasm is more common in children who undergo tonsillectomy than other procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Prevention and management of laryngospasm are discussed separately, with management shown in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113030\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113030 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques#H8654328\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia in neonates and children: Agents and techniques&quot;, section on 'Laryngospasm'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27777902\"><span class=\"h3\">IV versus inhalational induction</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children without risk factors for airway complications</strong> &ndash; The choice between IV and inhalation induction is a balance between the desire to obtain rapid induction, rapid airway control, operating room efficiency, and the ability of the child to tolerate IV catheter placement while awake. In practice, unless there are multiple risk factors for airway complications, we usually perform an inhalational induction for children &lt;12 years of age, and an IV induction for children &ge;12 years of age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight &gt;50 kg. In older children, the decision is individualized based on the child's level of anxiety and coping. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques#H3215143761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia in neonates and children: Agents and techniques&quot;, section on 'Inhalation induction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children with OSA or other risk factors for airway complications</strong> &ndash; When possible and tolerated by the child, IV induction may be preferable for patients with risk factors for airway complications (including post-tonsillectomy bleeding) in addition to the risk associated with tonsillectomy, as shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99883 \">table 1</a>). In particular, IV induction should be performed whenever possible for children with severe OSA. Children with severe OSA and craniofacial syndromes can quickly obstruct and desaturate. In addition to having a variety of standard laryngoscopes and blades, endotracheal tubes, and oral and nasal airways, anesthesia clinicians should be prepared for management of the potentially difficult airway in these patients, with difficult-airway equipment and assistance readily available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F89959\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89959 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to the beneficial effects of IV induction agents in these patients, placement of an IV catheter allows immediate administration of rescue drugs during induction of anesthesia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">succinylcholine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a>, epinephrine). When compared with inhalational agents, IV induction agents can more rapidly achieve a level of anesthesia deep enough for airway instrumentation. Of the IV induction agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> is the agent of choice as it provides rapid onset and short duration of action, attenuates the bronchospastic response to intubation, and has antiemetic effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing#H525814468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the child with asthma or recurrent wheezing&quot;, section on 'Intravenous induction agents'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27778086\"><span class=\"h3\">NMBAs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgeon does not require muscle relaxation for tonsillectomy. For intubation, we avoid the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for most children under the age of 10 and who weigh less than 50 kg who undergo tonsillectomy, unless a rapid sequence induction and intubation is necessary (eg, for tonsillar bleeding). For children over the age of 12 who weigh more than 50 kg, we administer low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rocuronium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">succinylcholine</a> when necessary (eg, for rapid sequence induction and intubation), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">remifentanil</a> for intubation (see <a href=\"#H27778159\" class=\"local\">'Remifentanil intubation'</a> below). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisatracurium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Cisatracurium</a> may also be used. If nondepolarizing agents are used, adequate return of neuromuscular function should be determined before the agents are reversed and the anesthesia discontinued.</p><p>Tonsillectomy is usually a short procedure, under 30 minutes long. Thus, a short-acting NMBA is required if used to facilitate intubation. Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">succinylcholine</a>, a rapid onset, short-acting depolarizing NMBA, for routine intubation in children has largely been abandoned. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a black box warning on the use of succinylcholine in children, except for emergency airway management, over concerns for acute rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia with possible cardiac arrest in children with undiagnosed muscular dystrophies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Despite this warning, succinylcholine can be used in select patients (eg, those who require rapid sequence induction), and appropriate screening is paramount prior to its administration. (See <a href=\"#H27780757\" class=\"local\">'Strategy for anesthesia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques#H4209807446\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia in neonates and children: Agents and techniques&quot;, section on 'Intravenous induction medications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-anesthesia#H370576226\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Succinylcholine'</a>.)</p><p>The use of the available nondepolarizing NMBAs, which are not associated with hyperkalemia or bradycardia, is limited by their longer duration of action prior to reversal with anticholinesterase agents (45 minutes, depending on the dose). Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rocuronium</a> can be used to facilitate intubation without full paralysis in order to allow more rapid reversal. Where available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sugammadex-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sugammadex</a>, a chelating agent that rapidly reverses even deep levels of paralysis with rocuronium or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vecuronium</a>, allows the use of these NMBAs even for short procedures.

Remifentanil can provide profound suppression of airway reflexes during endotracheal intubation, without the prolonged effects of other opioids. A relatively high dose of remifentanil (3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV) administered with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> (3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) and an anticholinergic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycopyrrolate</a> 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a> 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV) has been shown to provide excellent intubating conditions in children without hemodynamic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27778222\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of airway device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anesthesiologist shares the airway with the surgeon during tonsillectomy.

The mouth gag must be positioned and opened carefully to avoid either kinking the airway device or accidental extubation.</p><p>We suggest the use of a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) for children undergoing adenotonsillectomy, rather than an uncuffed ETT or supraglottic airway (SGA). We find that the cuffed ETT is easily placed, allows better access to the surgical site, and provides definitive airway control that only rarely needs to be replaced. An ETT with a preformed bend or a wire-reinforced ETT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F117091\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117091 \">picture 1</a>) should be used to avoid kinking at the mouth opening. </p><p>Advantages to a cuffed ETT include its ability to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seal the trachea, preventing pulmonary aspiration of blood and secretions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent the leakage of high-concentration oxygen into the airway, thereby reducing the chance of airway fire with the use of electrocautery at the surgical site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent pollution of the operating room with volatile anesthetic gases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide open access to the surgical site, potentially resulting in a more effective resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>Though not our usual practice, an SGA, such as a laryngeal mask airway (LMA), is used in some centers for tonsillectomy in children. If an LMA is used, a flexible, armored model is preferred because it is less likely to kink and has a smaller-diameter tube (and therefore can be used with the Crowe-Davis gag) compared with the standard LMA.</p><p>Potential minor benefits of an LMA include the fact that it is less stimulating to the airway and usually results in a smoother extubation with less coughing and straining. The LMA may also result in less perioperative adverse respiratory events for children with upper respiratory infections, as may be the case in children with chronic tonsillitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>However, the LMA takes up more room in the patient's mouth, such that surgical exposure may be more difficult and result in less effective resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, the LMA may be difficult or impossible to place or seat in patients with very large tonsils. In some cases, airway obstruction occurs when the mouth gag is opened, either because the LMA kinks or because of laryngospasm in response to the noxious stimulus of opening the mouth gag.</p><p>The literature comparing the use of an ETT with an LMA for adenotonsillectomy consists of small, retrospective studies, or those that include selected patient populations that limit generalization. A number of studies have reported rates of LMA failure during adenotonsillectomy with the need to convert to ETT, ranging from approximately 4 to 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/16,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-20</a>].

LMA failure may also be less likely when adenoidectomy is performed without tonsillectomy. Reasons for conversion to ETT include kinking of the LMA tubing or airway obstruction with mouth gag placement, inability to place or seat the LMA, and inadequate surgical exposure. Studies report conflicting results when comparing ETT with LMA with regard to other outcomes, including the rate of laryngospasm, coughing and gagging during surgery, operative time, and operating room time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/16,18-20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-20,23</a>].</p><p>While the literature does not definitively support the choice of one type of airway management over the other, it does seem clear that the safe use of an LMA for adenotonsillectomy requires close coordination between the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, and the recovery room staff.</p><p>The French Association for Ambulatory Surgery (AFCA) and the French Society for Anesthesia, Intensive Care (SFAR) have published clinical practice guidelines for tonsillectomy, including guidelines for anesthesia, which agree with our preferred approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H27777508\" class=\"local\">'Preanesthetic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with OSA are more sensitive to opioids and sedatives than children without OSA. For children with severe OSA, we recommend using reduced doses of intraoperative opioids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We typically reduce opioid doses by 50 percent. The lowest effective doses of short-acting opioids should be administered during anesthesia for tonsillectomy and after surgery, in combination with nonopioid analgesics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a>).
