It is classified into nociceptive and neuropathic pain based upon the underlying pathophysiology. Determining the type of pain helps in identifying the cause of pain, which may guide treatment choices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Inferred pathophysiology (types of cancer pain)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nociceptive pain is caused by stimulation of intact nociceptors as a result of tissue injury and inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63962\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63962 \">figure 1</a>). It is divided into somatic pain with receptors in skin, soft tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone; and visceral pain with receptors in internal organs, such as the kidney and gastrointestinal tract. Somatic pain is well localized and described as sharp, aching, squeezing, stabbing, or throbbing. Visceral pain is typically poorly localized, and is often described as dull, crampy, or achy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathic pain is caused by stimulation or abnormal functioning of damaged sensory nerves. It can be caused by compression, transection, infiltration, ischemia, or metabolic injury to the nerves. It is often described as burning, shooting, electric, or tingling.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Source and location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Details of the primary disease may be helpful in determining the source and type of pain, which may guide management decisions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer &ndash; Children with cancer may have nociceptive somatic pain (as defined in the preceding section) from bone metastases or tumor, nociceptive visceral pain (eg, from hepatic distention and bowel wall edema), and neuropathic pain from tumor infiltration of peripheral nerves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developmental impairment &ndash; Children with severe developmental impairment have nociceptive pain that may occur acutely from fractures, urinary tract infection, or pancreatitis, or chronically from gastroesophageal reflex, constipation, positioning, or spasticity. Such children are also at risk for neuropathic pain as a result of visceral hyperalgesia, central neuropathic pain, and development of peripheral neuropathic pain following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

These tools typically use a graphic outline of the body, and the patient is asked to &ldquo;color&rdquo; in the areas where <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is experiencing pain. A systematic review of the literature reported that although the quality of the studies included was not high, overall there was moderate evidence that these tools reliably located pain in older children (average age of patients: 10 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Observational tools</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following observational tools are used to assess pain in infants and children who are unable to self-report.

Based upon the limited data, no tool can be recommended over another. It is important that each center adopt guidelines of routine assessment for the detection of pain and provide staff training in the use of the selected pain assessment tool.</p><p>Observational assessment may underestimate pain severity compared with self-reporting. This was illustrated in a study of young children (three to seven years of age) following surgery, in whom pain severity obtained by observational assessment was lower than that obtained by self-reporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Behavioral measurement of pain must also be assessed in the context of other sources of distress, such as hunger or anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73565207\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonverbal children with neurological impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonverbal children with neurological impairment (NI) present unique challenges in evaluating the presence and severity of pain as they cannot self-report their pain. For many such children, pain can remain a frequent, recurrent problem that often remains undertreated without appropriate evaluation.</p><p>In this group of children, similar core pain behaviors are consistently identified and can be used to assess and identify pain. However, each child will display a unique set of responses and behaviors. This unique and variable expression necessitates input from a consistent care provider, often a parent, with knowledge of a child&rsquo;s typical behavior patterns at baseline and in response to painful and nonpainful (such as hunger) events.</p><p>Specific behaviors that are associated with pain in nonverbal children with NI include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vocalizations (crying, moaning).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial expression (grimacing).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to be consoled.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased movement, tone and posture (arching, stiffening), and physiological responses.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, some children display atypical behaviors such as laughing, becoming withdrawn, and lack of facial expression.</p><p/><p>Although pain assessment tools cannot replace the input of a parent or caregiver involved with the child on a daily basis, these tools can supplement the information from the <span class=\"nowrap\">parent/caregiver</span> and assist with monitoring by assessing severity prior to an intervention to treat pain. The pain assessment tools for nonverbal children with NI include the Revised Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (r-FLACC) scale and the Individualized Numeric Rating Scale (INRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>].

Management varies depending upon the type, source, severity, and duration of pain. In some cases, treating the underlying source of pain or other related symptoms, such as distress or anxiety, can relieve the symptom. Even if specific therapy is available to treat the underlying source of pain, it is important to also provide adequate therapy to relieve any pain and suffering.</p><p>General principles of pain management in children include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children/abstract/19-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular pain assessments should be made throughout the course of treatment; self-report should be obtained whenever possible.

After five or six half-lives (eg, 24 to 48 hours), a basal daily requirement is calculated based upon the previous 24-hour opioid requirement, and a long-acting opioid preparation can be substituted for persistent pain management.

In these patients, after assessing for a source of nociceptive pain that may be due to gastroesophageal reflux, urinary tract infection, bone fracture, acute pancreatitis, or gallstones, a trial of gabapentin therapy can be initiated. Other medications that can improve comfort in such children include tricyclic antidepressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a>, and opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-pain-in-children/abstract/2,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment and management of pain are essential components of pediatric care.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of pediatric pain includes determining the underlying type of pain (nociceptive versus neuropathic pain), source and location of pain, and the severity of pain. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the severity of pediatric pain is based upon the child's cognitive ability. Self-reporting is used in children who are able to understand and report their pain severity along a continuum (eg, visual analog scales, FACES scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51021\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51021 \">figure 2</a>)). In infants and children who are unable to perform self-reporting, behavioral observational scales are used (eg, revised Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability [r-FLACC] tool (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81819 \">table 1</a>)). Pain assessment in nonverbal children with neurological impairment is challenging because they are unable to self-report. However, observational tools based on behavioral response including input from daily caregivers (eg, parents) are helpful in the assessment of pain in this group of children. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of pain severity and cognition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of pediatric pain management is to reduce, control, or prevent pain in children. Pain management varies depending upon the type, source, severity, and duration of pain. General principles of pain management in children include the following (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Principles of management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Regular pain assessments should be made throughout the course of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of pain severity and cognition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain management includes both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures. Nonpharmacologic therapy (eg, cognitive, behavioral, physical, and supportive therapies) should be provided for children undergoing painful procedures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those who require pharmacologic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild pain can generally be adequately treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Nonopioid analgesics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate to severe pain is generally treated with opioid agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxycodone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydromorphone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methadone</a>). The choice of opioid is dependent upon the intensity and duration of pain, preferred mode of administration, associated adverse effects, previous experience (if available), and preference of the patient and family (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79047 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Opioids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oral analgesics should be used when possible to avoid painful routes of administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Side effects of analgesic agents should be anticipated and treated appropriately (eg, pruritus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> constipation with opioids).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adjuvant therapy can be helpful in certain clinical settings (eg, anticonvulsants for neuropathic pain, antidepressants or anxiolytics for coexisting mood disturbances).
