Two of these, myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, are relatively common. The others presented in this topic review, glutathione reductase (GR) deficiency, glutathione synthetase (GS) deficiency, and glycogen storage disease type 1b (GSD1b), are rare.</p><p>This topic review provides an overview of the genetic defects responsible for each of these disorders as well as their clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment.

MPO is the most abundant enzyme in the azurophilic granules and plays a critical role in bacterial killing by neutrophils. Deficient cells take approximately twice as long to kill pathogens in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myeloperoxidase-deficiency-and-other-enzymatic-wbc-defects-causing-immunodeficiency/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>MPO catalyses the conversion of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to hypohalous acid (in neutrophils the halide is chloride [Cl-] and the acid is bleach) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72548\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72548 \">figure 1</a>). This reaction is thought to amplify the toxicity of the reactive oxygen species generated during the respiratory burst against bacteria and fungi.</p><p>Neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), structures composed of decondensed chromatin and granule proteins that are thought to trap and kill pathogens, as part of their extracellular killing tools. Reactive oxygen species are required to initiate NET formation. Neutrophil elastase and MPO synergize to drive chromatin decondensation, contributing to this mechanism of extracellular killing of micro-organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myeloperoxidase-deficiency-and-other-enzymatic-wbc-defects-causing-immunodeficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>MPO expression is affected by a promoter polymorphism (specificity protein 1 [Sp1] consensus-binding site), which confers higher (G allele) or lower (A allele) activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than 95 percent of MPO-deficient patients are entirely asymptomatic, even though in vitro studies reveal that MPO-deficient neutrophils are markedly less efficient than normal neutrophils in killing <em>Candida albicans</em> and hyphal forms of <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myeloperoxidase-deficiency-and-other-enzymatic-wbc-defects-causing-immunodeficiency/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Candida infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of the small percentage of MPO-deficient patients with clinical findings, infections due to different <em>Candida</em> strains are the most frequently reported.

Patients with MPO deficiency had populations of &quot;large unstained cells&quot; in their automated differential counts that were not borne out by manual performance of the differential count.</p><p>Definitive diagnosis is established by histochemical staining of neutrophils for MPO, which is available through commercial labs.</p><p>The clinical relevance of identifying MPO deficiency in a particular patient, however, is less straightforward. Because so many patients with MPO deficiency are asymptomatic, patients with recurrent infections should be carefully evaluated for diabetes mellitus and other immune defects, even if MPO deficiency is identified. The differential diagnosis in a patient with invasive <em>Candida</em> infections, without external immune suppression, includes chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and the hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES). Mucocutaneous candidiasis is more common than spontaneous invasive candidiasis, but neither is a common manifestation of MPO deficiency.

G6PD deficiency predisposes to septic complications and anemia in patients who have suffered severe traumatic injuries.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) deficiency and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are relatively common disorders, while others are rare. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MPO deficiency is the most common primary disorder of phagocytes, although the vast majority of affected individuals are asymptomatic. Recurrent <em>Candida</em> infections are seen in the small number of patients who do manifest symptoms, and MPO deficiency may play a role in the development of <em>Candida</em> infections in patients with diabetes mellitus or malignancies. The diagnosis is established by histochemical staining of neutrophils for MPO, and there is no specific corrective therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Myeloperoxidase deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in humans. G6PD is necessary for the neutrophil respiratory burst and also protects red blood cells from oxidative damage. It is an X-linked disorder that most often presents with hemolytic anemia. Patients with severe deficiency may have increased susceptibility to bacterial infections and sepsis. G6PD deficiency may also confer some advantages, such as protection from malarial infection. Treatment of immune dysfunction may include prophylactic antibiotics and aggressive treatment of infections. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deficiencies of glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione synthetase (GS) are extremely rare autosomal recessive diseases. Severe GS deficiency may present with hemolytic anemia, metabolic acidosis, progressive central nervous system (CNS) defects, and recurrent bacterial infections. Daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a> supplementation can improve neutrophil function in GS deficiency. Infections are not a feature of GR deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Glutathione pathway alterations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycogen storage disease 1b (GSD1b) is a rare recessive disorder that presents in childhood with fasting hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, hepatomegaly, seizures, neutropenia, and neutrophil dysfunction. Sinopulmonary infections and mucosal ulcers are observed, and there is associated inflammatory bowel disease. The diagnosis is made with genetic analysis. Treatment involves maintaining normal blood glucose levels, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy improves immune function. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Glycogen storage disease 1b'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3232017833\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge E Richard Stiehm, MD, who contributed as a Section Editor to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myeloperoxidase-deficiency-and-other-enzymatic-wbc-defects-causing-immunodeficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Parry MF, Root RK, Metcalf JA, et al.
