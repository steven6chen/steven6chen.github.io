The increase in multifetal gestations is important because these pregnancies are at higher risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications than singleton pregnancies. The two most serious risks are (1) complete pregnancy loss and (2) preterm birth, with its potential sequelae including perinatal mortality, respiratory and gastrointestinal complications, infection, and long-term neurologic impairment. The risks of prematurity are discussed in detail separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-and-mortality-of-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence and mortality of the preterm infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term complications of the preterm infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-preterm-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late preterm infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term complications of the preterm infant&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>When matched for gestational age at birth, the neonatal outcome of multifetal gestations is similar to that of singleton gestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]; however, the unadjusted risk of adverse neonatal outcome is not equivalent because the incidence of preterm birth is much higher in multifetal gestations than in singleton gestations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75320%7EOBGYN%2F60676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75320 graphicRef60676 \">table 1A-B</a>). In 2011, 57 percent of twins and 93 percent of triplets were delivered preterm, compared with about 10 percent of singletons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Moreover, 11 percent of twins, more than one-third of all triplets, and more than two-thirds of all quadruplets and higher order multiples were delivered very preterm (&lt;32 weeks of gestation), compared with less than 2 percent of singletons.</p><p>The incidence of multifetal pregnancy is minimized by limiting the number of embryos transferred in ART, cancelling an ovulation induction intrauterine insemination cycle when ovarian response suggests a high risk of multifetal pregnancy, and using in vitro fertilization (IVF) instead of ovarian hyperstimulation when there is an increased risk of multifetal pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. When multifetal pregnancy occurs, multifetal pregnancy reduction (MPR) and selective termination (ST) are two procedures specifically developed to mitigate risks and address problems unique to multifetal gestations. The goal of MPR is to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in survivors of higher order pregnancies by decreasing the number of fetuses in the gestation, since the risk of complications is proportional to the number of fetuses in utero. By comparison, the goal of ST is to prevent the survival of a specific anomalous fetus of a multifetal pregnancy in which the fetuses are discordant for anomalies.</p><p>This topic will discuss MPR and ST.

Despite these limitations, it is clear that the morbidity and mortality of multifetal gestation increase with increasing numbers of fetuses, and that adverse outcomes are primarily the consequence of preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/5-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-19</a>].</p><p>The increasing risk of perinatal mortality with increasing numbers of fetuses was illustrated by data from the United States National Center for Health Statistics for 1995 to 1997, which included 304,466 twins, 16,068 triplets, 1448 quadruplets, and 180 quintuplets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Early mortality (death from 20 weeks of gestation through the first year of life) was 4.8 percent for twins, 8.6 percent for triplets, 10.8 percent for quadruplets, and 28.9 percent for quintuplets. The authors estimated that by limiting multifetal gestations to twins, approximately 58 percent of early triplet mortality and 70 percent of early quadruplet mortality could be prevented.</p><p>The increased risk of long-term neurodevelopmental morbidity is of particular concern: the prevalence of cerebral palsy ranges from 1.6 to 2.3 per 1000 surviving infants in singletons, 7 to 12 per 1000 surviving infants in twins, and 28 to 45 per 1000 surviving infants in triplets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78659\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78659 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. While one study reported that the risk of CP in survivors of triplet gestation may not be reduced by MFR to twins, there was insufficient statistical power to reach such a conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Multifetal pregnancy also increases the mother's risk of developing pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage, and gestational diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/14,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21-23</a>].</p><p>Medical outcomes are not the only consideration. The economic and psychological impacts of multiple birth on families are also important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. First-time parents rarely appreciate the intensity of care that infants require. The emotional stress and complexity of caring for singleton newborns are magnified with multiples, especially those with medical or developmental issues. Over 25 percent of multiple birth parents experience depression or anxiety disorders in the perinatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Most also experience difficulties in caring for twins or higher order multiples, but obtaining assistance from additional caregivers may be affected by socioeconomic, geographic, or cultural factors. Thus, economic and psychological issues can be additional indications for MPR. In response to these many issues, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) updated its 2017 Committee Opinion to state that &quot;obstetrician-gynecologists should respect patients' autonomy regarding whether to continue or reduce a multifetal pregnancy&quot; and that &quot;only the patient can weigh the relative importance of the medical, ethical, religious, and socioeconomic factors and determine the best course of action for her unique situation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Ideally, multiple gestations should be prevented by better control of ovulation induction and embryo transfer (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-control-the-rate-of-high-order-multiple-gestation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to control the rate of high order multiple gestation&quot;</a>). In the absence of successful preventive interventions, reducing the number of fetuses lowers the risk of complications in survivors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction of high order multifetal pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MPR should be considered for any pregnancy with three or more fetuses, as there is good evidence that it improves pregnancy outcome for survivors (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy outcome'</a> below). In fact, an International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) Committee Report stated that, &quot;Multiple pregnancy of an order of magnitude higher than twins involves great danger for the woman's health and also for her fetuses, which are likely to be delivered prematurely with a high risk of either dying or suffering damage&quot; and &quot;where such pregnancies arise, it may be considered ethically preferable to reduce the number of fetuses rather than to do nothing&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction of twin pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MPR can also be considered for a twin pregnancy, although this is more controversial in the absence of a medical or obstetrical indication (eg, maternal cardiac disease, history of preterm singleton delivery, cervical insufficiency with history of pregnancy loss) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/4,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,28-31</a>]. Reduction to a singleton has become more common over the years. One center reported an increase in frequency from 11.8 percent of their first 1000 MPRs to 31.8 percent of their last 1000 MPRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Because of the increased risk associated with a twin pregnancy, MPR in this setting is still medically indicated. Some patients choose to reduce twins to a singleton based on evidence that the perinatal morbidity and mortality of twins, although relatively low, is still at least twice that of singletons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Others feel that they can meet the needs of one additional child, but not multiple additional children. Patients considering such a decision should be given objective information, and not be influenced by the ethical or moral values of the consulting physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Preprocedure considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to be familiar with local laws. In some states, patients may need to be consented for an abortion, which may require a specific waiting period.</p><p>MPR is usually performed between 10 and 13 weeks of gestation for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical issues (eg, the fetuses have to be large enough for adequate visualization by transabdominal ultrasound).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most spontaneous fetal losses will have occurred by 10 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be performed and some fetal abnormalities can be identified, thus potentially converting MPR to selective termination. In those patients not opting for CVS, nuchal translucency screening should be performed between 10+5 to 13+5 weeks. In the case of preimplantation screening (PGS) before embryo transfer, the <span class=\"nowrap\">risks/benefits</span> of confirmation of karyotyping should be discussed, as well as the option for performing a chromosomal microarray if CVS is planned prior to the reduction procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early reduction allows parents to undergo the procedure while the pregnancy is relatively private.</p><p/><p>Knowledge of chorionicity is crucial before performing MPR or ST. Chorionicity is best established by ultrasound examination in the first trimester.</p><p>The traditional technique of injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> assumes multichorionic placentation, which does not contain interfetal placental vascular anastomoses. If two fetuses have a shared circulation and one is reduced by injection of a toxin, there is a very high likelihood that the toxin will also get into the cotwin's circulation and cause fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, acute adverse hemodynamic changes in the survivor could occur due to blood loss into the vascular system of the dead fetuses. MPR by potassium chloride injection should not be performed in monochorionic fetuses, and alternative techniques should be employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Monochorionic fetuses'</a> below.)</p><p>Immediately prior to any invasive procedures, an ultrasound examination is performed to establish the relationship of the gestational sacs to each other, to determine which of the fetuses are most accessible to needle insertion, and to survey the fetal anatomy for structural anomalies and markers of aneuploidy, such as increased nuchal translucency or absent nasal bone. Although MPR is usually performed at the end of the first trimester, which is before a comprehensive anatomical survey is likely to reveal most anomalies, a limited structural survey can be performed in this gestational age range. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Chorionic villus sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be performed on one or more of the fetuses prior to MPR. In general, CVS is performed on the fetuses that are not intended to be reduced. The obvious advantage of performing CVS before MPR is to ensure that the chromosomally normal fetuses are not reduced. Women with multifetal gestations are at increased risk of carrying aneuploid fetuses because (1) many of these women are of advanced maternal age, (2) the risk of aneuploidy is cumulative (risk multiplied by the number of fetuses), and (3) reproductive endocrine techniques may affect embryonic genes and chromosomes.</p><p>At our center, 44 percent of MPRs after 2002 were preceded by CVS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a later publication by our group evaluating trends in MPR for the second 1000 patients, 70 percent of the last 200 patients (patients 1801 to 2000) underwent a CVS before the MPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The vast majority of patients have the MPR performed after the full culture results are known, which takes about seven to nine days. Some patients who are geographically located distant from our center have the procedure after FISH, analysis for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y. Although 30 percent of chromosomal anomalies identified on a full karyotype analysis would not be detected by FISH using these probes, the absolute risk that a clinically significant abnormality would be missed is small. Given both a normal FISH and normal ultrasound (including nuchal translucency), the residual risk of abnormal karyotype has been calculated to be about <span class=\"nowrap\">1/400</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/500</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, even at that relatively small risk, many women prefer to wait for the additional information available on the full karyotype result. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chorionic villus sampling&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Performing CVS before MPR does not increase the post-procedural pregnancy loss rate above that of MPR alone, and may decrease losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. The largest series reported on the outcome of 758 patients who underwent MPR, of whom 58 percent also had CVS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The overall loss rates in the CVS and non-CVS groups were not significantly different (CVS 4 percent and non-CVS 7 percent). When the groups were stratified by finishing number, there was a significantly lower loss rate in the singleton CVS group than in the singleton non-CVS group (2 versus 9 percent). It is unclear why the CVS group had lower loss rates, but it may be that leaving a chromosomally normal fetus is somehow protective. We did not have information on the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities among those patients who underwent pregnancy loss and did not have a CVS.</p><p>An accurate description, as well as a diagram of the relative positions of the gestational sacs and placentas, must be carefully recorded so that if an abnormal karyotype is identified, it can be correctly matched to the affected fetus. Attention should also be paid to the relative fullness of the maternal bladder, as filling and emptying the bladder can change the appearance of the <span class=\"nowrap\">sacs/placentas</span>. Nevertheless, diagnostic error due to incorrect matching of results and fetus has been reported in up to 1.5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique for MPR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a multichorionic pregnancy, the fetus(es) reduced are those that are most easily accessible, usually those closest to the anterior uterine wall <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the fundus. The fetus above the cervix is avoided whenever possible because of a hypothetical increased risk for infection or uterine irritability if that fetus were reduced. However, if a fetus has a lagging crown rump length, a significantly smaller sac, markers of aneuploidy, or an obvious anomaly, then that fetus is preferentially reduced since these findings are associated with adverse pregnancy outcome (miscarriage, fetal aneuploidy, etc).</p><p>The most common technique uses a transabdominal (TA) approach. A transcervical (TC) or a transvaginal (TV) approach can be used, but have been associated with increased post-procedural pregnancy loss rates when compared with the TA approach; therefore, these approaches are usually reserved for situations in which the TA approach is not technically feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>The procedure is performed by injection of approximately 2 to 3 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> (concentration 2 mEq <span class=\"nowrap\">KCl/mL)</span> into the fetal thorax using a 22 gauge spinal needle under ultrasound guidance. Asystole is usually seen within one minute of injection of potassium chloride, and total procedural time is typically less than five minutes. Additional fetuses can be reduced with the same needle puncture or, more commonly, with a separate needle stick.</p><p>While prophylactic antibiotics were used at our center in the early years of MPR, over the last 10 years, antibiotics have not been given. Since they are not used for CVS or amniocentesis, there was no plausible rationale for their use with MPR.</p><p>The patient is asked to wait in the waiting area, and an ultrasound is performed one hour after the procedure to again confirm asystole in the reduced fetus(es) and cardiac activity in the nonreduced fetus(es). The reduced embryo(s) or fetus(es) are left in situ and typically become desiccated and compressed to become part of the fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">membranes/placenta</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Postprocedure considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data available on the optimal follow-up protocol after reduction.

Furthermore, the collaborative series included some TV and TC procedures, which are associated with higher loss rates than the TA approach, while the single center series only used the TA approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to most other analyses, a systematic review including 893 trichorionic triplet pregnancies managed expectantly or reduced to twins reported MPR was associated with a significantly higher miscarriage rate (delivery &lt;24 weeks) (8.1 versus 4.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, MPR also resulted in significantly fewer early preterm births (delivery at 24 to 31 weeks) (10.4 versus 26.7 percent). Seven (95% CI 5-9) reductions would need to be performed to prevent one early preterm delivery, while the number of reductions that would cause one miscarriage was 26 (95% CI 14-193).

Although many in the MPR group expressed sadness and guilt one year after birth of the remaining fetuses, the majority overcame the pain associated with the reduction at two years. Furthermore, when compared with mothers of nonreduced triplets, mothers who had undergone MPR had less anxiety and depression and a more satisfactory relationship with their children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Since MPR is not really a &quot;termination of pregnancy,&quot; but a procedure developed to &quot;increase the prospects of pregnancy continuation,&quot; we do not consider it a type of abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, since laws may vary from state to state, it is important to know the law in the state in which the MPR is performed, and be aware of any special legal considerations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTIVE TERMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selective termination (ST) refers to a procedure in which one or more anomalous fetus(es) in a multifetal pregnancy are terminated. The affected fetus usually has a chromosomal, structural, or genetic abnormality that has been identified by ultrasound examination or by an invasive prenatal diagnostic test, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. In contrast to multifetal pregnancy reduction (MPR), the selectively terminated fetus(es) is chosen based upon a fetal abnormality rather than randomly or based upon its position in the uterus.</p><p>ST was initially developed for fetuses with major anomalies that could result in the survival of a severely impaired fetus. ST is also offered for lethal anomalies because, for some parents, it is emotionally preferable to undergo ST than to continue to carry a fetus that will die after birth. In addition, it is theorized that in some cases, termination of the anomalous twin may optimize the outcome of the normal fetus. As an example, anencephaly is often complicated by polyhydramnios due to impaired fetal swallowing, which increases the risk of preterm labor. Termination of the anencephalic fetus, and subsequent resolution of the polyhydramnios, theoretically may decrease the risk of preterm labor. In addition, ST has been reported to reverse preeclampsia when occurring in the setting of a hydropic fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Preprocedure considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to identify which fetus is to be terminated. Previously diagnosed fetal abnormalities, particularly genetic disorders in which the fetus may appear sonographically normal, are not always obvious at the time of ST. Correct identification of the affected fetus can be made by ultrasound detection of a structural abnormality (if present), by gender (if discordant), or by previously documented fetal, sac <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> placental position. Use of dye at the time of invasive testing is typically not useful even when sequential samples are obtained hours or days apart, as it may not remain in the amniotic fluid long enough. Thus, precise in utero mapping of fetal and placental positioning at the time of prenatal diagnosis is critical. If there is any doubt as to the correct identification of the affected fetus, rapid determination of fetal karyotype by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) can be performed before the procedure. Results of FISH are usually available within 48 hours. As with MPR, accurate determination of chorionicity is crucial before performing ST, as conventional termination techniques can only be performed on a dichorionic fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Monochorionic fetuses require a different reduction procedure (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Monochorionic fetuses'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Dichorionic fetuses</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique for selective termination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Potassium chloride</a> is injected into the thorax (ideally intracardiac) of the affected fetus under ultrasound guidance until asystole is confirmed, similar to the technique used for MPR (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Multifetal pregnancy reduction'</a> above). The fetus is then left in situ for the duration of the pregnancy. Usually performed at a more advanced gestational age than MPR and with a larger fetus, the terminated fetus is generally not resorbed. Over a period of weeks to months, however, the amniotic fluid around the fetus will disappear, and the fetal tissue will become significantly condensed. The reduced fetus is usually delivered along with the placenta, and the patient is not aware of its presence. It can be sent to pathology, but usually is too macerated for any meaningful evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Pregnancy outcome after selective termination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In continuing pregnancies, outcome after ST is generally favorable, with low rates of prematurity and few maternal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. In two large series, the median gestational age at delivery after ST, for continuing pregnancies, was 35.7 and 37.1 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>The overall pregnancy loss rate before 24 weeks of gestation after ST was 4.0 percent in the largest single center series of 200 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] and 7.5 percent in the largest collaborative experience of 402 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The effects of starting number, finishing number, and number of fetuses reduced are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76689\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76689 \">table 6</a>). The lowest loss rate (2.4 percent) after ST is observed with a starting number of two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This rate increased significantly to 11.1 percent when starting with three or more fetuses. The most striking increase in post-procedural loss rates was seen when more than one fetus was terminated: 42.9 versus 2.6 percent when only one fetus was terminated. The reason for the higher multifetal loss rate with ST than with MPR (see above) is unclear, but may be an effect of small numbers in these series.</p><p>The effect of gestational age on post-procedure loss rate has been a source of concern when the fetal abnormality is diagnosed after 20 weeks of gestation. Initial studies reported higher rates of preterm delivery for patients who underwent ST after 20 weeks than those undergoing the procedure at or before this gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. As an example, one series showed a trend towards increasing loss rates with advancing gestational age at the time of the procedure: for procedures performed at 9 to 12 weeks, 13 to 18 weeks, 19 to 24 weeks, and 25 or more weeks, the loss rates were 5.4, 8.7, 6.8, and 9.1 percent, respectively, although these differences did not reach statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In contrast, another study found no advantage to performing ST at an earlier gestational age and observed a trend toward a higher rate of pregnancy loss in patients undergoing ST at less than 20 weeks compared with ST performed later (5.9 versus 1.3 percent, p = 0.09) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In a case-control study by our group that assessed the timing and outcomes after selective termination in dichorionic twin pregnancies, we reported that ST performed earlier in pregnancy was associated with decreased fetal loss and decreased rates of prematurity. In this study of ST performed between 10 to 23.7 weeks, each increase of one week of gestational age at time of ST was associated with a 2.69 week decrease in GA at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. We believe the best interpretation of these data is that, in experienced hands, ST is safe and effective at any gestational age, but should occur soon after the decision is made to proceed with termination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Third trimester termination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ST in the third trimester is legal in some states within the United States and in several countries. One series describes 36 dichorionic pregnancies that underwent ST at greater than or equal to 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Sixty-four percent of the terminations were performed for structural anomalies and 36 percent for chromosomal abnormalities. The mean gestational age at delivery was 36.9 weeks; 13.8 percent of patients delivered before 34 weeks. This study established late ST in twin pregnancies as a safe procedure with reasonable perinatal outcome. Patients with an anomalous fetus, particularly those who are diagnosed after 24 weeks of gestation, should be made aware that third trimester termination is an option, even though it may not be available in the particular state or country where they reside.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Monochorionic fetuses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, termination of a fetus of a monochorionic pair is possible, but more complicated because of shared fetoplacental vessels. Alternative techniques must be used to avoid passage of a toxin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a>) from one fetus to the other or sequelae from hemodynamic changes within the shared circulation.</p><p>Potential approaches for ST in monochorionic twins include open surgical procedures (via hysterotomy), endoscopic procedures (fetoscopy), and ultrasound guided needle techniques. The most common method of termination has been cord occlusion, which can be performed in a variety of ways, including bipolar, laser, or photo coagulation; radiofrequency ablation, or suture ligation. Radiofrequency ablation has become the preferred procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/62-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-78</a>]; however, the optimal method has not been established, as most studies consist of single case reports or small case series and technical factors (eg, cord diameter and length) affect the choice of procedure. Complication rates have come down over time as the size of procedure needles and trocars has been reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of studies of umbilical cord occlusion for selective feticide in monochorionic twins included 345 cases performed at 14 and 35 weeks of gestation between 2000 and 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

The elevation is probably caused by release of tissue or serum from the dead fetus(es); therefore, amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal karyotype are not indicated based upon elevated MSAFP levels alone. Since MSAFP is always elevated, it should not be drawn for screening purposes because it has no value. Instead, detailed ultrasonography should be performed to screen for fetal structural defects. Information on the effects of MPR on midtrimester maternal serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and unconjugated estriol (uE3) are limited, contradictory, and difficult to interpret (as with any multifetal gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multifetal-pregnancy-reduction-and-selective-termination/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].
