In this trial, 180 patients were randomly assigned to either mifepristone or placebo. There was no improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS; 10 versus 12 months). The lack of activity in this trial may have been due to loss of expression of progesterone receptor in patients with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-recurrent-meningioma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Estrogen receptor inhibitors</strong> &ndash; Two studies have evaluated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> in patients with inoperable meningiomas, without definitive evidence of clinical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-recurrent-meningioma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

There were no objective responses in the 29 patients with measurable, biopsy-proven benign meningiomas, although the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 27 months and the three-year PFS rate was 43 percent.

All patients had received prior surgery and radiation therapy (RT), and 34 had received prior systemic therapy. No objective responses were observed, although 26 patients (74 percent) had stable disease for at least 12 weeks. Median overall survival was eight months.</p><p>The extent to which these results indicate clinical activity for IFNa is unclear, since grade I meningiomas are generally slow growing and multiple scans may be required to demonstrate significant changes in tumor size.
