They come in different forms, including pills, creams, and eye drops.</p><p>OTC medicines are commonly used to treat:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (if it makes your child uncomfortable)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough and cold (in children older than 6 years)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin rashes, diaper rashes, or hives</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea or constipation</p><p/><p>Some OTC medicines can cure conditions (such as rashes), but many only treat symptoms for a short time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12539657\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know the correct dose of medicine for my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To figure out the correct dose, you need to look at the medicine's &quot;Drug Facts&quot; label (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73468\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73468 \">figure 1</a>). The section called &quot;Directions&quot; tells you how much medicine to use and how often to use it.</p><p>The dose might depend on your child's weight. If you do not know your child's weight, use the dosage for his or her age.</p><p>To give your child the correct dose, make sure to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the dosing device that comes with the medicine. If the medicine doesn't have a dosing device, ask the pharmacy, doctor, or nurse for one.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Read the directions every time, even if you have given the medicine to your child before. Medicines can come in different strengths. Also, companies sometimes change medicines and doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow the directions carefully. Do not give your child more medicine than directed. Giving your child extra medicine will not make him or her feel better, and it can cause serious problems.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12539672\"><span class=\"h1\">Can OTC medicines cause side effects?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. OTC medicines can cause side effects. The side effects depend on the medicine. Children are more likely to get side effects from OTC medicines than adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12539687\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I give my child 2 or more OTC medicines at the same time?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on the medicines and their &quot;active ingredient.&quot; The active ingredient is the part of the medicine that treats symptoms. Every medicine has at least one active ingredient.</p><p>To know what the active ingredient is, look at the Drug Facts label (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73468\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73468 \">figure 1</a>). It's important to read the Drug Facts carefully, because medicines that treat different conditions can have the same active ingredient. For example, fever medicines and cough and cold medicines can have the same active ingredient.</p><p><strong>Do not give your child 2 medicines with the same active ingredient</strong>. Giving your child 2 medicines with the same active ingredient can cause an overdose. This can cause serious &ndash; and even life-threatening &ndash; problems. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12539702\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call the doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child has side effects or problems from an OTC medicine.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child's symptoms don't get better or get worse after using an OTC medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12539717\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk to your child's doctor or nurse about OTC medicines at routine check-ups, before your child gets sick. Ask him or her which medicines you should use, when to use them, and how to use them. That way, if your child gets sick, you will know what to do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask questions if you are unsure which medicine to use or how to use it. You can ask the pharmacist or your child's doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose a medicine made to treat only the symptoms or condition your child has.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close the medicine tightly and store it out of your child's reach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throw out medicine that has expired (gone bad).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Teach your child that medicine shouldn't be eaten like candy, and that it can be dangerous to take too much.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the number for the Poison Control Center: 1-800-222-1222 (in the United States), in case your child gets too much medicine.</p><p/><p>Here are some other safety tips:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> give your child medicine made for adults without first asking the doctor or nurse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> give cough and cold medicines to children younger than 6 years old. Cough and cold medicines can cause serious problems in young children. Plus, they are not likely to help with symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to children younger than 18 years old. It can cause a life-threatening condition called Reye syndrome in young people.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12539732\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eczema-atopic-dermatitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Eczema (atopic dermatitis) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diaper-rash-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diaper rash (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-allergies-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seasonal allergies in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-seasonal-allergies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergic rhinitis (seasonal allergies) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atopic dermatitis (eczema) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diaper-rash-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diaper rash in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Constipation in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
