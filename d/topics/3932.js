The endogenous forms include cobalamin and holotranscobalamin, which represent the active fraction of plasma cobalamin. The supplemental forms used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency include cyanocobalamin, which contains a cyanide (CN) atom introduced during chemical synthesis, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxocobalamin-vitamin-b12a-supplement-and-cyanide-antidote-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxocobalamin</a>. Cyanocobalamin is predominantly used in the United States, and hydroxocobalamin is predominantly used in Europe; both are effective in treating vitamin B12 deficiency. The major difference between the two preparations is in the pharmacokinetics and dosing interval, as discussed separately.

At the time it was described, PA was truly pernicious as it was associated with continuous worsening of symptoms and even death without an available treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Folate</strong> &ndash; Folate is also called vitamin B9. The terms &quot;folate&quot; and &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably; however, the vitamin is found in nature as a folate, while folic acid is the synthetic form used therapeutically and is an oxidized, water-soluble form that does not exist in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Dietary folates are also called folate polyglutamates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Folinic acid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a>, N5-formyl-tetrahydofolate [THF], 5-formylTHF) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) are naturally occurring forms of reduced folate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Folinic acid is typically used to prevent toxicities of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and to potentiate cytotoxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) in chemotherapy regimens for colon cancer. This is because folinic acid is rapidly converted to the metabolically active form of folate required in cells (tetrahydrofolate) without the need for dihydrofolate reductase, which is inhibited by methotrexate. 5-MTHF is the most abundant form of folate in plasma. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Folic acid</a>, folinic acid, and 5-MTHF are all effective in treating folate deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid</strong> &ndash; Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) are metabolic intermediates that accumulate when a step in the recycling of folate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72986\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72986 \">figure 1</a>) or <span class=\"nowrap\">homocysteine/methionine</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58245\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58245 \">figure 2</a>) is blocked. Homocysteine is elevated in both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> and folate deficiencies, whereas MMA is only elevated in vitamin B12 deficiency; the reason for these patterns is discussed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F112986\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112986 \">figure 3</a>).

Megaloblastic anemia is a term that refers to anemia in which the process of nucleic acid metabolism is impaired, resulting in nuclear-cytoplasmic dyssynchrony, reduced number of cell divisions in the bone marrow, and nuclear abnormalities in both myeloid and erythroid precursors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113390\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113390 \">picture 1</a>). Therefore, the term should be confined to nucleated red blood cell (RBC) precursors when used to describe red blood cell morphology. Macrocytic anemia is purely a morphologic terms that describes large RBCs in the peripheral blood and includes all anemias with a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Megaloblastic anemia is a type of macrocytic anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=macrocytosis-macrocytic-anemia#H322328536\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Macrocytosis/Macrocytic anemia&quot;, section on 'Megaloblastic anemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2721228465\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> and folate deficiencies is likely to vary among different populations and depending on the threshold used to define deficiency. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>General population</strong> &ndash; In a 2016 series of 3324 patients with anemia in a general practice population in the Netherlands, 249 had macrocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of these, there were 46 cases of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency (1.4 percent of all anemic individuals; 18 percent of those with macrocytic anemia) and 16 cases of folate deficiency (0.5 percent of all anemic; 6 percent of macrocytic anemia). A 2014 review of folate testing performed on outpatients in the United States found folate deficiency in only 47 of 84,187 (0.056 percent); another 166 (0.2 percent) had low-normal values (3.0 to 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Older adults</strong> &ndash; In a 1994 review of 548 older adult participants from the Framingham heart study (ages 67 to 96), serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> levels were low (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> in 29 (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Another 6 percent had vitamin B12 levels that were above the lower limit but were associated with increased levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine, indicative of functional deficiency (see <a href=\"#H2329087791\" class=\"local\">'MMA and homocysteine'</a> below). Only one person had antibodies to intrinsic factor. By comparison, in a control group of healthy individuals aged 22 to 63 years, 1.7 percent had low vitamin B12 levels. Serum folate levels were low (&lt;2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> in 16 of the older adult participants (2.9 percent, some of whom also had vitamin B12 deficiency) and 1.7 percent of controls.

Folate deficiency (assessed using red blood cell folate) (see <a href=\"#H3255000039\" class=\"local\">'RBC folate'</a> below) was observed in 4 of 2563 (0.16 percent). It should be noted that these prevalences apply to the subset of patients in whom testing was performed; the prevalences in all hospitalized patients are lower.</p><p/><p>Pernicious anemia (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency due to autoantibodies) (see <a href=\"#H3792687810\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above) is most common in northern European whites; the incidence is lower in individuals with African or non-northern European ancestry.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin B12</a> and folate deficiency are extremely rare in infants and children but they may occur (eg, vitamin B12 deficiency in an infant born to a mother with vitamin B12 deficiency). Folate deficiency may occur in a child unable to tolerate a normal diet or in severely malnourished infants or children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micronutrient-deficiencies-associated-with-malnutrition-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Micronutrient deficiencies associated with malnutrition in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of folate deficiency in healthy people with normal dietary intake has declined progressively in countries that have implemented routine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation of foods, which began in the late 1990s and early 2000s in many parts of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The countries that use fortification of foods with folic acid are illustrated on a website from the Food Fortification Initiative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This phenomenon is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 2015 report from Canada that evaluated hospitalized patients for folate deficiency and found a prevalence of 0.16 percent, the only causes of folate deficiency were alcohol use, a malabsorption syndrome, decreased oral intake due to schizophrenia, and a spurious value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As noted above, the 2014 retrospective review from the United States that analyzed 11 years of experience with folate testing in the outpatient setting found a prevalence of folate deficiency below 0.06 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>These observations support the practice of omitting the serum folate level in the evaluation of individuals with an intact gastrointestinal tract who are consuming an adequate diet.

This is likely to be because most cases of vitamin B12 deficiency are due to defects in absorption rather than dietary lack; therefore, routine supplementation of vitamin B12 has not been implemented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3398308103\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic findings associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> and folate deficiency include severe macrocytic anemia, yellow skin (caused by combined anemia and jaundice), and variable neurologic abnormalities more prominent in vitamin B12 deficiency (mental sluggishness, shuffling gait). These were seen more commonly in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, when deficiencies were often quite advanced upon presentation. These findings may be present, but often more subtle presentations are seen in healthy individuals living in resource-rich countries. Routine supplementation of grains with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> and routine complete blood count (CBC) testing have made dietary deficiencies uncommon and have led to earlier diagnosis in many individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1110320732\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many individuals with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> or folate deficiency have an associated condition that predisposes them to one or more vitamin deficiencies.

There will no longer be hypersegmented neutrophils on the blood smear, and the MCV will eventually return to normal, although it may remain high initially (during reticulocytosis) since reticulocytes are larger than mature RBCs.

However, a support-group-based survey of patients with PA found that only approximately one-fourth had undergone endoscopic screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiency/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. There are insufficient data to support routine surveillance with upper endoscopy following an initial screening in the absence of symptoms or to alter the patient's schedule for colon cancer screening based on the diagnosis of PA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1599208022\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-diagnostic testing in folate deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, diagnosis of folate deficiency does not eliminate the possibility of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency. Individuals with folate deficiency and concomitant vitamin B12 deficiency may have an apparent response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation with normalization of the hematologic findings and even apparent normalization of the serum vitamin B12 level. However, folic acid cannot correct the neurologic deficits caused by vitamin B12 deficiency; these deficits may become progressive and irreversible if not treated with supplemental vitamin B12. Thus, it is prudent to check the vitamin B12 level in an individual diagnosed with folate deficiency.
