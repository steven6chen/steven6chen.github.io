(See <a href=\"#H13466474\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients are able to keep up with their fluid losses without the need for additional therapies. However, for patients with severe, prolonged symptoms, supportive care includes antimotility agents and enteral or parenteral nutrition. (See <a href=\"#H2287687300\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunologically healthy patients usually have a spontaneous recovery within a few days to weeks and parasitologic cure within a few weeks to months without requiring any specific therapy. However, for those who have severe acute symptoms or symptoms for greater than 14 days, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitazoxanide</a> for three days, rather than supportive care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1314611105\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompetent hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For HIV-infected patients with cryptosporidiosis, we recommend antiretroviral therapy (ART) be initiated in addition to supportive care (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Immune reconstitution has been associated with resolution of symptoms. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitazoxanide</a> (eg, 500 to 1000 mg twice daily for two to eight weeks for adults) can be initiated while awaiting CD4 cell recovery if supportive measures do not lead to resolution of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H4027583402\" class=\"local\">'HIV-infected patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with other immunocompromising conditions (eg, those who have undergone solid organ transplant), we reduce the dose of immunosuppressive therapy if possible, and administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitazoxanide</a> for at least two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H2222704870\" class=\"local\">'Other immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For immunocompromised patients with severe diarrhea, and for those who have failed initial treatment, we suggest combination therapy rather than monotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitazoxanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitazoxanide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paromomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paromomycin</a> used in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> may lead to improved clinical outcomes in immunocompromised hosts.

In addition, people with cryptosporidial diarrhea should be advised to avoid swimming in public pools for two weeks after the diarrhea has resolved. (See <a href=\"#H13465874\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For immunocompromised patients, antimicrobial prophylaxis for <em>Cryptosporidium</em> is not routinely administered.
