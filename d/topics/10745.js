While the number of Americans living in SNFs for extended periods has fallen steadily over the past decade as an increasing proportion of older individuals remain in their homes or in assisted living facilities, the number receiving short-term nursing care has risen dramatically. In 2014, 1.7 million fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries were cared for in 15,000 SNFs, costing Medicare USD $28.6 billion. This represents 2.4 million SNF stays: 20 percent of all hospitalized FFS Medicare beneficiaries are discharged to a SNF. The majority of these facilities are the same institutions as those providing residential long-term care: 95 percent of SNFs provide both kinds of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>SNF residents, whether short- or long-term, tend to be old, female, and have multiple impairments in their activities of daily living (ADLs). Of those in SNFs in 2014, 16.6 percent were between the ages of 65 and 74, 26.6 percent were between 75 and 84, 33.7 percent were between 85 and 94, and 7.8 percent were 95 years of age or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the same population, 6.1 percent had impairments in three ADLs, 41.2 percent had impairments in four ADLs, and 22.4 percent had impairments in five ADLs. Cognitive impairment is also widespread in this population, with 36.9 percent exhibiting severe impairment, 24.9 percent having moderate impairment, and 38.2 percent with mild or no impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>SNF care represents a substantial segment of health care costs for older individuals: in the United States in 2010, $143 billion was spent on SNF care, of which 14 percent was paid by Medicare, 63 percent by Medicaid, and 22 percent privately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The costs of care are covered differently, depending on whether the patient is receiving long- or short-term care:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term residents live at the facility and are often described as receiving &ldquo;custodial care.&rdquo; Room and board costs for this group are generally paid for by Medicaid, long-term care insurance, or out-of-pocket by residents or their families.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most short-term patients discharged from a hospital setting, the goal is to return to the community. A subset of these patients may be at the SNF for short-term end-of-life care and some will require long-term care. Room and board costs are generally paid by their SNF benefit, which, in the case of Medicare, covers up to 100 days per benefit period if care needs meet specific clinical criteria. Clinical criteria include the need for rehabilitation to regain function due to deconditioning, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical instability requiring frequent nursing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical intervention. In the Medicare FFS system, a patient must be in an acute hospital as an inpatient for 72 hours (three midnights) to qualify for the SNF benefit. Although the benefit can last for 100 days, a substantial copay is required after day 21. The average length of stay in a Medicare-covered SNF post-acute episode is about 25 days and is declining. Some Medicare-managed care and bundled payment programs can obtain a waiver of the 72-hour rule and directly admit patients to the SNF. The length of stay for these patients is generally shorter because of the financial incentives for care at the lowest level that is safe and feasible.</p><p/><p>Clinicians providing medical care in the SNF must be knowledgeable about regulatory, ethical, and epidemiologic as well as geriatric issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For certain conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, medical management is similar to outpatient management. This topic will focus on those medical conditions in SNF patients that warrant a particular approach or heightened awareness. Many are geriatric syndromes that comprise constellations of symptoms that may have any of several etiologies. The topic will also address those regulatory, ethical, and epidemiologic issues that bear on clinician practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comprehensive geriatric assessment includes an evaluation of the patient's functional, physical, cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial status. It is a cost-effective intervention that improves quality of life in a variety of settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and is recommended for use in frail older adults by the American Geriatrics Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The skilled nursing facility (SNF) is an ideal environment in which to carry out comprehensive geriatric assessment since its population is at high risk and the length of stay is relatively long, even for short-term rehabilitation patients. In fact, a comprehensive assessment as well as periodic reassessments are required by law. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26429831\"><span class=\"h2\">The Minimum Data Set</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA-87) mandates that all SNFs complete a comprehensive evaluation of residents at the time of admission, an assessment that is intended to serve as the basis for the plan of care. A pivotal part of the assessment is the Minimum Data Set (MDS), a standardized instrument mandated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Completion of the MDS 3.0 serves as the basis for the creation of an individualized treatment plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Data from the MDS are also used to determine reimbursement rates for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries and to measure quality of care in nursing homes, both for long- and short-term residents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F114026\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114026 \">table 1</a>). A subset of these measures is posted on the CMS website, Nursing Home Compare, to help patients and families select a facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and they are used in the calculation of the 5-Star rating, which is increasingly important to SNFs for bundled payment initiatives and relationships with Accountable Care Organizations.</p><p>A key component of the MDS is measurement of the individual&rsquo;s ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) including transferring, ambulating, hygiene, toileting, communicating, and eating. For most short-stay patients, the focus is on achieving independence with these activities. The emphasis for long-term care residents is on preventing functional decline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26429838\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals for post-acute care (short-term patients)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post-acute patients are typically expected to make gains in function and therefore usually receive some combination of physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech therapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapists focus on mobility, including ambulation with and without assistive devices, as well as wheelchair mobility. Stair training is provided when appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupational therapists address hygiene, self-feeding, and dressing. Often they work together with physical therapists to address transfers to and from bed, chair, and toilet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speech therapists address safety in eating and swallowing by advising on food and beverage consistency as well as chewing and swallowing techniques. They also assist patients who suffer from communication problems such as dysarthria, aphasia, or hearing impairment. They may train facility staff, family, and home caregivers in techniques to optimize communication.</p><p/><p>To achieve home discharge, SNFs provide interdisciplinary care that incorporates clinicians, advance practice clinicians, facility nurses, case managers, and social workers. Mental health clinicians and dieticians are often active members of the team as well. In addition to providing ongoing medical care for problems diagnosed in the acute care hospital and facilitating rehabilitation, SNFs must be alert for the occurrence of new problems. Nurses, recreation therapists, and certified nursing assistants (CNAs) will typically be the first facility staff members to recognize that a new medical problem is developing. Family members often notice subtle early changes in condition as well. Close communication with the attending clinician is important to assure that new acute medical conditions, drug side effects, or psychiatric issues such as depression are addressed rapidly and effectively. The Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers (INTERACT) program has a variety of tools that facilitate these processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In addition to optimizing function and medical care, the interdisciplinary team must identify what home supports the patient will need. These supports may be provided by the family and may also involve agencies such as home health agencies and area agencies on aging. Caregiver education is a crucial aspect of preparation for discharge to a home setting, with an emphasis on how to monitor and manage the patient's medical conditions and how to administer medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26429845\"><span class=\"h2\">Family meetings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Family meetings are an important component of care in SNFs. Care planning meetings are recommended within the first few days of SNF admission. Additional meetings can be helpful for short-term patients with complex medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychosocial care needs prior to discharge, or whenever there is a significant change in condition in a long-term resident. Families are generally asked to participate in care planning meetings on a quarterly basis for long-term residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Such meetings serve as a means of learning and sharing information and can facilitate medical decision-making and advance care planning. Whenever possible, the patient and surrogate decision makers should attend the meeting along with key staff, including representatives of the rehabilitation team, nursing, and social service along with the attending clinician (physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant). A useful format for family meetings includes the following steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of the current medical situation to be sure that clinicians, patient, and family have the same understanding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of advance directives currently in place, including whether the patient or resident is capable of making their own care decisions, the name of the surrogate decision-maker, and any agreed-upon limitations of care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of treatment options, including an explanation of what can be done at home, in the SNF and at the hospital</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6972760\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issues addressed here are those identified by the Minimum Data Set (MDS) as especially important in the skilled nursing facility (SNF) population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6972768\"><span class=\"h2\">Vision and hearing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impairments in vision and hearing are reversible causes of impaired quality of life in nursing home residents.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All residents should undergo the simple vision screening assessment included in the MDS. Residents who demonstrate moderate visual impairment or worse should undergo formal vision testing by an optometrist or ophthalmologist, unless they would not be expected to benefit from intervention due to severe dementia or other comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H26429831\" class=\"local\">'The Minimum Data Set'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residents should undergo a screening hearing test using the whisper test and, when feasible, audiologic evaluation for a hearing aid if the screening test is positive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hearing loss in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Simple remedies for visual impairment such as finding a missing pair of glasses can facilitate rehabilitation for short-term patients. In other patients, testing for refractive errors and supplying glasses to correct vision improves measures of quality of life and symptoms of depression at two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-health-maintenance#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric health maintenance&quot;, section on 'Vision screening'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, cataract surgery in SNF residents can lead to significant improvements in vision, psychological distress, and social interaction when compared with matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A comprehensive vision restoration-rehabilitation program introduced in a random sample of nursing homes led to a higher rate of cataract surgery in eligible residents, compared with usual care facilities (31 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Readily reversible causes of hearing impairment, such as impacted cerumen, should be corrected. Hearing impairment is found in 70 to 90 percent of older SNF residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Uncorrected hearing impairment adversely affects quality of life by leading to depression, cognitive impairment, and social isolation. In the long-term care setting, many individuals who have hearing aids are unable to use them independently and rely on assistance from certified nursing assistants (CNAs). Many residents with hearing impairment have not been evaluated for a hearing aid. In part, this reflects inadequate insurance coverage. Medicare pays for 80 percent of the cost of a hearing evaluation but does not cover hearing aids; Medicaid pays some or all of the cost of a hearing aid in 31 states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The BIMS is included in the Minimal Data Set (MDS) 3.0, mentioned above.

Prevalence in the long-term population is even higher, as the behavioral and cognitive problems associated with dementia are a frequent reason for admission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6976115\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild to moderate dementia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for cognitive symptoms due to Alzheimer disease and other dementias is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. One rationale for a trial of therapy, to maximize the potential that a patient continues to be able to live in the community setting, becomes moot once patients are admitted for long-term care but may be important for short-term patients to maximize the likelihood of home discharge.</p><p>A discussion of pharmacologic options for dementia treatment is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholinesterase-inhibitors-in-the-treatment-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of dementia-related behavioral symptoms (agitation, wandering, aggression, and other symptoms) is often difficult in the SNF environment and is discussed separately.

A prospective study of 323 residents with advanced dementia followed for 18 months found a mortality rate of 54.8 percent, with 41.1 percent developing pneumonia and 85.8 percent developing problems with eating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the same population, during the last three months of life, 40.7 percent of residents were hospitalized, had an emergency department visit, were treated with intravenous medications, or underwent tube feeding.</p><p>Enrollment of patients with advanced dementia in hospice is sometimes problematic, given the difficulty of predicting six-month mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, adoption of a palliative approach to care is both feasible and advisable even when patients are not referred for hospice care. Discontinuing medications that are unlikely to provide benefit, such as lipid-lowering agents or cholinesterase inhibitors, can decrease costs of care and risk of adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

This tool has a sensitivity of 94 to 100 percent and specificity of 90 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While other instruments are available for screening, a review of 11 bedside instruments used to identify the presence of delirium in adults concluded that the best evidence supported the use of the CAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;, section on 'Recognizing the disorder'</a>.)</p><p>Delirium is a geriatric syndrome present in over one-third of hospitalized older adult patients, many of whom continue to have delirium on hospital discharge. In one study of 4744 admissions to eight post-acute facilities, one in seven patients was found to have delirium on admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Shortened hospital stays and the increasing age of the population are likely to increase these numbers. Delirium has been identified in 16 percent of all patients admitted to nursing facilities, affecting both long-term and post-acute residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Delirium is associated with multiple adverse outcomes in SNF patients. In one study, for example, patients with delirium who were admitted to post-acute nursing facilities had a higher 30-day mortality, a higher hospital readmission rate, a lower likelihood of discharge home, and a lower likelihood of physical function improvement compared with patients without delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>The signs and symptoms of delirium can be subtle and transient, making detection difficult. This can be especially problematic for new admissions to SNFs when staff may be unaware of the baseline status of patients and thus not realize that cognitive, behavioral, or functional changes are new. Patients with delirium can be incorrectly thought to have dementia, depression, psychosis, or even &quot;normal&quot; aging. Clinicians in SNFs should incorporate observations of facility staff as well as the family members of patients in order to identify and monitor delirium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;, section on 'Recognizing the disorder'</a>.)</p><p>Patients are often transferred to emergency departments for evaluation of symptoms related to delirium. While transfer can provide rapid medical assessment, it is a source of disruption and stress to patients, especially those with dementia. Additionally, it can be difficult for clinicians not familiar with the patient to assess for significant changes in cognition. While delirium is often described as a medical emergency and prompt evaluation is needed, consideration should be given as to whether a delirium evaluation can be performed by medical staff within the nursing facility using onsite laboratory and radiograph services. The Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers (INTERACT) program contains a care path and other decision support tools for the evaluation and management of altered mental status without transfer to the hospital when safe and feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Pharmacologic management of delirium needs to be tailored to the symptoms. More severe symptoms may require the use of antipsychotic medications. Whether atypical antipsychotics are more effective than typical antipsychotic medications in delirium management remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Antipsychotic agents are considered chemical restraints and their use is carefully scrutinized in the SNF setting. Supportive documentation for their appropriate use must be provided in the medical record. Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided unless the delirium is specifically caused by alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Primary prevention of delirium is probably the most effective treatment strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. An observational prospective study of delirious hospitalized patients showed that factors related to worsening delirium severity include: the number of room changes, the absence of a clock or watch, the absence of reading glasses, and restraint use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Misuse of psychotropic medications in older adults to address these issues leads to frequent adverse effects and deteriorating medical and cognitive status. To combat this problem in the United States, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA&ndash;87), mandated freedom for every resident from medically unnecessary &quot;physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience.&quot; Measurement of restraint use is a CMS quality indicator for long-term residents. Nonetheless, a study of 16,586 newly admitted residents to nursing homes across the United States found that 28 percent received at least one antipsychotic medication in the year following admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Agitation may be due to the dementing process or a reversible medical condition such as urinary retention or infection. Once acute medical problems have been excluded, clinicians should consider empirical treatment of pain. One cluster randomized trial of nursing home patients with dementia found that a systematic approach to the management of pain, compared with usual care, decreased agitation and did not worsen activities of daily living (ADLs) or cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Studies indicate an increased mortality associated with use of either conventional or atypical antipsychotic medications for dementia-related psychosis, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2008 has issued a black box warning that &quot;antipsychotics are not indicated for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The only recourse for clinicians is to inform the patient, family, and caregivers of the mortality risk associated with antipsychotic medications in older adults and to decide with them whether to proceed with treatment. The prevalence of the use of antipsychotic medications is a CMS quality indicator for both short- and long-term SNF residents.</p><p>If antipsychotics are used, sedating, highly anticholinergic medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a> should be avoided, as should conventional antipsychotics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, which may cause parkinsonism.

Patients with pain should be assessed as to whether pain medications should be given &quot;on demand&quot; (prn) or on a scheduled basis and whether long- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> short-acting preparations should be used. Anticipating the loss of bowel motility caused by opioids is essential. Bowel medication programs may need to be adjusted with escalations or reductions in opioid doses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain&quot;, section on 'Opioid bowel dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>Persistent pain is common in frail and older adults. They frequently have cognitive deficits and impaired communication that make obtaining an adequate history challenging. For these same reasons, it can also be difficult monitoring the response to pain medications. An algorithm may be helpful in assessing pain in SNF residents with severe cognitive impairment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66129\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66129 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Persistent pain should be managed by following the WHO pain ladder, often using scheduled rather than prn medications and using nonpharmacologic modalities including heat, cold, and range of motion exercises. Prolonged use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in this population carries risk; hence, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and weak opioid analgesics may be preferred over NSAIDs for some patients. Topical NSAIDs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> patches may be helpful in the management of persistent pain.</p><p>Factors that contribute to uncontrolled pain in SNFs include using medications with insufficient potency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inadequate frequency of administration, particularly for patients recently transitioned from parenteral to oral medications. Post-acute patients typically require physical and occupational therapy, which can result in increased pain as activity increases. As mentioned above, use of prn medications in cognitively impaired residents commonly contributes to uncontrolled pain.</p><p>Post-acute patients typically have conditions that are expected to improve. Ongoing assessment needs to be made regarding optimal timing for gradual dose reduction of pain medications. Planning how opioids will be administered and tapered after discharge is essential and must be coordinated with the clinicians who will assume care post discharge.</p><p>Pain at the end of life poses unique challenges. Often patients are unable to take oral medications, necessitating that pain medications be administered via alternate routes. Transdermal and sublingual preparations of opioids can be particularly useful in the SNF setting. While subcutaneous injections can often be used in SNFs, the duration of pain relief tends to be shorter than with oral or transdermal preparations with an increased likelihood of suboptimal pain control. While some facilities are able to give pain medications via subcutaneous infusion pumps, most are not.</p><p>Staff resistance to opioid administration at the end of life is often related to fears of causing harm to the patient. Strong clinician and facility leadership coupled with educational programs for staff are essential to provide effective pain management to this population. In addition, hospice involvement can provide additional support and expertise in managing pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6972857\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition and hydration</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6976530\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both short-term patients and long-term SNF residents are particularly vulnerable to difficulties maintaining adequate nutrition and hydration. Patients admitted from the acute care hospital setting are at risk for weight loss because they may have been &ldquo;nothing by mouth&rdquo; (NPO) or on a restricted diet in the hospital for significant periods of time perioperatively or to obtain imaging studies. In addition, delirium, pain and gastrointestinal disorders can impact nutritional status even after such conditions resolve or improve. Institutional settings may not provide food choice offerings that match patient preferences. Chronic illness, depression and medication side effects can further cause or contribute to anorexia and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Long-term SNF residents often have chronic, progressive illnesses that impact appetite, chewing, swallowing, and digesting of food, and some weight loss is unavoidable.</p><p>The CMS standards dictate that every SNF resident should be provided with sufficient food and fluids to maintain proper nutrition and hydration. Significant weight loss is a CMS quality indicator for nutrition and hydration in long-term SNF residents. Assessment for weight loss is part of the MDS quarterly reassessment process. Unintentional weight changes of 5 percent in 30 days and 10 percent in 180 days require care plan review. Studies indicate that unintentional weight loss of 5 percent is a marker for a 5- to 10-fold increased risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>SNFs should document whether weight loss is expected or is unintentional. In residents who are terminally ill, weight loss may be unavoidable and palliative treatment plans should be in place indicating that low oral intake and weight loss is expected. If unintended weight loss is present, the resident should be assessed for remediable causes.</p><p>The interdisciplinary team is important in the prevention and management of weight loss. SNFs have registered dieticians who perform nutritional assessments and can make recommendations regarding diet and the use of nutritional supplements. The <a href=\"http://www.mna-elderly.com/&amp;token=u4LGfPJWfU4qSdkHP9GH/tMK1fviC4LmigWfBF9toWN/ngcQmuAWCEwBPGtIlXtz&amp;TOPIC_ID=3011\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA)</a> can identify patients with, or at risk for, malnutrition with 96 percent sensitivity and 98 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>Interventions related to weight loss and optimizing nutrition need to be integrated with the patients' overall goals and a well-documented plan of care. Interventions by speech therapists, occupational therapists, or behavioral health clinicians may be indicated, depending on the etiology of the weight loss. Dysphagia, for example, is commonly associated with neurologic problems such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, or stroke. Post-acute patients may have oral infections (eg, thrush), inflammation related to radiation therapy, or dentures that are misplaced or ill-fitting. Speech therapists can identify the most appropriate food consistency and can work with patients to optimize chewing and swallowing techniques. Impaired dexterity, whether due to arthritis, stroke, or a recent fracture, can make it difficult for patients to use utensils. Occupational therapists can teach patients to use assistive devices such as utensils with thickened handles that are easy to grasp. Nursing assistants provide supervision, encouragement, and assistance with feeding. SNF staff members also teach family members and other caregivers how to manage these nutrition-related issues prior to discharge to home for short-term patients.</p><p>Long-term residents with advanced dementia often have difficulty chewing and swallowing. There is no evidence that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes improve nutritional status or prolong life in the SNF resident with advanced dementia, the most common situation in which dysphagia occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].

However, antidepressants can also cause anorexia (SSRIs) or anticholinergic symptoms such as dry mouth and constipation (tricyclic antidepressants). Evidence suggests that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> may be more effective than SSRIs in promoting weight gain, most likely because its mechanism of action is both serotonergic and noradrenergic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

This risk is magnified in cognitively impaired SNF residents who may be unable to articulate the experience of thirst and in physically impaired residents who may have difficulty procuring fluids. Medications such as diuretics further increase the risk of hypovolemia, especially when an acute medical condition diminishes appetite and fluid intake. Simple interventions such as regularly offering fluids to residents have been shown to significantly decrease the frequency with which dehydration develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>The symptoms of hypovolemia in the nursing home population are often nonspecific, such as a change in mental status or falls. More specific signs of hypovolemia, such as orthostatic hypotension, dry mucus membranes, hypernatremia, and prerenal azotemia are typically associated with more profound degrees of volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. </p><p>SNFs vary in their capability to start and maintain intravenous (IV) therapy. When a decision is made to provide artificial hydration, subcutaneous fluid infusion (hypodermoclysis or clysis) is an underused alternative to IV therapy for treatment of mild to moderate hypovolemia. Clysis may be useful in SNFs without continuous availability of nurses or clinicians to insert or maintain an intravenous catheter, for residents with poor veins or those who repeatedly remove intravenous lines secondary to agitation, and in those on hospice or palliative care for symptom relief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6972866\"><span class=\"h2\">Pressure injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of pressure injury (formerly known as pressure ulcers) is an important quality indicator in SNFs.

Whether the pressure injury is an independent risk factor for mortality, or a marker for underlying comorbidities, is unclear.</p><p>MDS 3.0 requires assessment by SNF staff of patients for pressure injury based upon the <a href=\"http://www.npuap.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/push3.pdf&amp;token=Qkl/gwEktwLz6NUbipzHoAjcNI/JYyMMebR7JcKDzLGCQ771W74vymSRP3ET0p1+QDfypASzm5Vzrh9AoFA52w==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3011\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing tool (PUSH)</a>. This tool standardizes documentation of pressure injuries based on location and size. In addition, pressure injuries are staged by a I to IV grading system based upon the degree of penetration into underlying structures. When the wound bed cannot be adequately visualized because of slough, wounds are &quot;unstageable.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury#H76128198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;, section on 'Clinical features and staging'</a>.)</p><p>SNF short-term patients and long-term residents are at risk for pressure injuries for a variety of reasons including immobility after surgical procedures, impaired nutritional intake, sensory and cognitive impairment, and incontinence. Hip fractures and strokes can lead to pressure injuries of the heel, coccyx, and sacrum because of pain and reduced mobility.</p><p>The extent to which pressure injury is preventable is controversial. In surveys of prevention practices among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries, there was no link between documentation of a quality indicator, such as a turning schedule every two hours or using a pressure&ndash;reducing device and the incidence of pressure injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. However, these modalities are an integral part of pressure injury care. A cost-effectiveness analysis based upon a Markov model compared four potential strategies to prevent pressure injury in the nursing home setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Assuming a cost-effective threshold of USD $50,000 for one quality-adjusted life year (QALY), a foam cleanser for patients needing incontinence care and pressure redistribution mattresses for all residents were likely to be cost-effective. Skin emollients for dry skin and oral nutritional supplements for residents with recent weight loss were likely not cost-effective.</p><p>MDS 3.0 requires documentation of interventions put in place to manage pressure injury including pressure-relieving devices, positioning and turning protocols, and specific wound treatments. Pressure injury management requires an interdisciplinary approach for which the SNF environment can be well-suited. Nurses; dieticians; nursing aids; physical, occupational, and speech therapists; and wound care consultants all have roles to play in pressure injury management. Their services and interventions must be coordinated to develop, implement, and monitor a plan of care to meet the needs of a patient with or at risk for developing a pressure injury. The attending clinician must oversee this effort and enlist additional consultation when appropriate.</p><p>Pressure injuries are often associated with nutritional compromise based upon assessments such as prealbumin and albumin levels, calorie counts, and weight loss. Coexisting medical issues that affect appetite and nutrient absorption can further increase risk. Healing of wounds is thought to require higher protein intake over baseline. Small studies have found oral nutritional supplementation helpful in the healing of pressure injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>A variety of products may be used in the care of pressure injury. Product choice is based upon the specific characteristics of the wound: the presence of slough, the amount of exudate, and the size and depth of the wound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-management-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vacuum-assisted closure devices are commonly used to assist with wound healing for both acute and chronic wounds. They decrease the need for frequent dressing changes but are costly. Few data indicate that they are superior to other commonly used modalities for the treatment of pressure injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their families with terminal conditions may choose to forgo interventions that could reduce the risk of pressure injury development or promote pressure injury healing. Examples include requests to minimize repositioning or decisions to decline surgical debridement or wound grafts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6972875\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of adverse drug events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polypharmacy, often defined as taking five or more medications, puts patients at increased risk of adverse drug reactions and, especially in frail older individuals, is associated with risks of falling, delirium, and other geriatric syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. While MDS 2.0 used nine medications as the threshold for worrisome polypharmacy, MDS 3.0 has eliminated the simple numerical approach. The focus is now exclusively on medications with a high risk of side effects, principally antipsychotics, anxiolytics, anticoagulants, and hypnotics. This change acknowledges that multiple medications are often used synergistically for many common conditions. However, the risk of medication-related problems is proportional to the number of medications taken. Nationally, 68.8 percent of residents in SNFs in the United States take nine or more medications and nearly 20 percent take antipsychotic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-prescribing-for-older-adults#H18186995\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug prescribing for older adults&quot;, section on 'Polypharmacy'</a>.)</p><p>Age-related pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes increase the vulnerability of older SNF residents to adverse reactions from medications. Drug accumulation is related to changes in the distribution and concentration of drugs due to increase in body fat and decreased hepatic and renal clearance. Enhanced central nervous system sensitivity to anticholinergic agents predisposes older patients to problems such as delirium, constipation, urinary retention, and gait instability.</p><p>Medication toxicity is a major cause of hospitalization in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. In a study of risk factors for adverse drug events among nursing home residents, independent risk factors included: taking opioids, antipsychotics, or antidepressants; taking more than nine medications; and multiple comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. All SNF facility staff need to be alert to common medication-related side effects such as altered mental status, falls, constipation, and functional decline. It is also important for facilities to have a culture that encourages the reporting of adverse drug events or medication errors so that systems can be improved.</p><p>Several factors may contribute to polypharmacy in older adults. Frail patients often have multiple chronic diseases, each of which typically triggers a clinical algorithm designed to define optimal care. However, what is optimal for a patient with one disease is not necessarily optimal for someone with multiple conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. In addition, patients whose life expectancy is limited and whose goal of care is comfort may not be appropriate candidates for algorithms designed to prolong life. For such patients, it is reasonable to avoid intensive treatment of diabetes and hypertension and to forgo preventative treatment of conditions such as osteoporosis and hyperlipidemia.</p><p>Polypharmacy also results when the side effects of medication are interpreted as a new condition, which is then treated with an additional medication rather than by stopping or adjusting the dose of the offending medication. As an example, laxatives may cause diarrhea, leading to the prescription of antidiarrheal agents instead of discontinuing the laxative.</p><p>In addition, care transitions accentuate the risks for polypharmacy. Patients often go from hospital to the SNF with no explanation as to why certain medications are being given, why doses may have been changed, and what medications may have been purposely omitted. Nursing staff need to be encouraged to question orders if the indication for medications they are administering is unclear.</p><p>An accurate medication list that reflects prehospitalization medications and changes made during the hospital stay is often not available when patients arrive at the SNF. Effective medication reconciliation is the gold standard for all SNF admissions. When medication dosing or indications are unclear, family members, prior clinicians, and pharmacies must be contacted for clarification. When available, electronic medical records should be reviewed.</p><p>The SNF can reduce unnecessary medication use through pharmacy consultants who review medication regimens and make recommendations to eliminate medications, modify dosages, or monitor parameters with clinical or laboratory tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Compared with usual care, involvement of a pharmacist to review medications on transfer from the hospital to the SNF and to communicate recommended changes to the attending clinician decreased the risk of a discrepancy-related adverse drug event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. In addition, a cluster randomized trial found that a pharmacist-led medication review decreased the rate of delirium in SNF patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p>The issuance of monthly medication sheets serves as an opportunity for reviewing medication regimens on long-term patients. As the SNF patient's status changes, medications that were once appropriate may no longer be necessary. A study in 22 nursing facilities in the Boston area found that 37.5 percent of patients with advanced dementia received at least one medication that was not appropriate in late dementia (most commonly acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and lipid-lowering agents) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Discharges from the SNF to home provide an opportunity to review and optimize the medication regimen. Schedules should be practical and patients or caregivers need to understand the indication and potential side effects of all medications. It is also important to be sure that patients can afford to buy their medications. Finally, the clinician(s) assuming care for the patient must receive an accurate medication list.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6972884\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary and bowel issues</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49568988\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary incontinence, affecting at least 57 percent of SNF patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>], is associated with increased risk of hospitalization, UTI, and pressure injuries and significantly impairs quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].

The diagnosis and treatment of urinary incontinence is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary incontinence in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosis and management of urinary incontinence in the SNF setting includes the following steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establish a diagnosis of the type of incontinence (stress, urge, overflow, mixed, or functional) with a targeted history and physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate for potentially reversible conditions such as delirium, urinary retention, bladder infection, constipation, diabetes, excessive caffeine intake, or medications (eg, anticholinergics and diuretics).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Institute prompted voiding, which was found to be somewhat effective at short-term follow-up in reducing daytime incontinence in two systematic reviews of randomized trials involving SNF patients with cognitive impairment and urinary incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/112,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,113</a>]. One study among long-term residents suggested a persistent benefit four months after the intervention period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. Most trials used research staff to provide the prompting intervention, and it is uncertain whether implementation with usual nursing staff would be similarly effective, given constraints of added cost and nursing time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with urge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stress incontinence may benefit from learning and practicing pelvic muscle exercises, if feasible. Some physical therapists have expertise in teaching these exercises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider pharmacologic therapy with antimuscarinic agents for urge type incontinence, particularly in residents who are at high risk for falls due to urinary urgency. These drugs have been shown to be effective in older adults in the community, although the applicability of findings to the SNF population is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Studies of these drugs in the SNF are generally of poor quality, and these patients may be particularly vulnerable to adverse effects (dry mouth, constipation, confusion). The extended-release forms of antimuscarinic medications appear to produce fewer adverse drug reactions and a lower incidence of dry mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. A beta-3 agonist (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirabegron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirabegron</a>) that does not have antimuscarinic side effects can be used for those with cognitive impairment or susceptibility to other antimuscarinic effects. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because urge incontinence is associated with both cognitive and functional impairment in the SNF population, drug therapy must be combined with a toileting intervention such as prompted voiding. Individuals with severe cognitive impairment who do not cooperate with toileting interventions are not good candidates for drug therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carefully selected individuals who are willing to undergo the risks, discomfort, and costs may benefit from further urologic, gynecologic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urodynamic therapy. Examples of such patients include women with severe pelvic prolapse or stress incontinence, men suspected of having obstruction, and patients who have failed behavioral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drug therapy who are still bothered by their symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534238692\"><span class=\"h3\">Fecal incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of fecal incontinence in the SNF population is constipation and fecal impaction with leakage of loose stool around the impaction. Treatment should therefore address the constipation. Laxatives, antibiotics, and hyperosmolar supplements can also contribute to fecal incontinence. Fecal incontinence that is associated with a neurologic disorder or end-stage dementia is usually managed supportively in the SNF population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1708994843\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute urinary retention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary retention is a common problem in the SNF. Unrecognized retention may be the etiology of pain, constipation, or agitation. It is especially common in men, due to prostate enlargement, but may be found in men or women in the setting of stroke or diabetes. It can also be triggered by anticholinergic medications such as antihistamines or tricyclic antidepressants. An ultrasound bladder scanner, available in many SNFs, allows for quick and accurate diagnosis. The evaluation and management of acute urinary retention is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-urinary-retention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute urinary retention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49569008\"><span class=\"h3\">Constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintaining continence and avoiding constipation are the two major goals of bowel management in SNFs. Constipation is common in SNF patients, with nearly 50 percent using laxatives regularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-the-older-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constipation in the older adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Constipation can lead to anorexia, urinary retention, both urinary and fecal incontinence, social isolation, rectal prolapse, and fecal impaction which in turn increase the risk of hospitalization. Rarely, severe constipation results in intestinal perforation.</p><p>Recognition of constipation is impeded in patients with cognitive deficits and impaired communication abilities. Constipation may also be missed because of suboptimal communication amongst nursing staff.</p><p>Many medications cause constipation, including anticholinergics, opioids, iron, calcium and NSAIDS. Constipation can lead to polypharmacy if it is managed with laxatives rather than by eliminating or modifying the inciting medication(s).</p><p>Constipated patients should be examined to exclude fecal impaction. Sometimes liquid stool is passed around a fecal impaction, resulting in fecal incontinence and delaying the diagnosis of constipation. Urinary retention or incontinence may also be a symptom of fecal impaction. Fecal impaction requires suppositories <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> manual disimpaction to avoid further complications as well as bowel management strategies to prevent recurrence.</p><p>SNF patients recently discharged from an acute care hospital often have constipation related to inactivity, impaired oral intake, medications such as opioids, and hospital-related environmental factors. These factors often resolve as functional status, diet, and the overall medical condition improves. Accordingly, bowel medications may need to be initiated on admission but reduced or eliminated later in the course of the SNF stay.</p><p>Privacy, responsiveness, and flexibility around the timing of toileting are important factors in helping avoid constipation and incontinence. There is variation in SNFs both in types of medications used to manage constipation and the amount of staff time required to deliver constipation-related care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6972893\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANCE CARE PLANNING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term patients as well as long-term skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents are often older adults, frail, and have life-limiting conditions. They are at high risk for morbidity and mortality. Cognitive impairment from reversible or permanent causes is frequent. Planning for future treatment by establishing an advance care plan is essential in this population and should begin with identifying a surrogate decision-maker and establishing the goals of care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SNFs in the United States, like other health care institutions receiving federal funding, are required by the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) of 1990 to ask residents if they have an advance directive and, if they do not, whether they would be interested in information about advance care planning. Since implementation of the PSDA, the rate of completion of advance directives among SNF patients has risen to 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. Identifying a surrogate to serve as health care proxy when important medical decisions must be made is imperative since the majority of long-term SNF residents have some degree of dementia, and even cognitively intact older individuals are at risk of delirium should they become acutely ill.</p><p>Conversations between the SNF resident and the health care proxy can help prioritize among the patient's goals of care (eg, life prolongation, maintenance of function, maximization of comfort) and allow the proxy, working with the clinician, to infer what kind of approach to treatment would be most appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. Living wills and instructional directives may also be of use. Short videos have also been shown to help patients or families prioritize their goals of care and establish an advance care plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. A systematic program to increase the use of advance directives in SNFs can reduce utilization of health care services (and therefore costs) without adversely affecting patient or family satisfaction or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Many web-based resources are available to assist SNF residents, their families, and SNF staff in discussing and executing advance directives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/121-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-123</a>].</p><p>Assessment of decision-making capacity is needed to determine if a health care proxy needs to be activated. This assessment is often performed with the input from the SNF care team, including clinician, therapists, nurses, and social worker. Mental health clinicians may be asked to participate as well. This includes the ability to understand current medical issues and the ramifications of choosing or not choosing specific treatments. Facilities may require that the clinician meet specific documentation requirements to activate a health care proxy.

Choosing whether to be designated DNR is especially important since, based on CMS rules, SNFs are required to initiate basic life support after a cardiac arrest unless a resident has a DNR order in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].

There were only four survivors of 60 days or more. Three of these were short-term patients who had previously been ambulatory and virtually independent in their activities of daily living (ADLs); they all returned to their previous level of function. The fourth was a fully dependent bed-ridden patient who returned to that level of care for a survival period of 100 days. Of the four long-term survivors, three of the arrests were witnessed, and one was indeterminate.

Moreover, many hospitals have a policy requiring that they re-address the issue of patient preferences for care and do not automatically follow wishes laid out in an advance directive. Use of a medical order that is valid across all sites of care such as the Physician Order Form for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), introduced in Oregon and now available in many other states, can assure that patient&rsquo;s wishes will be honored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].

Further, in a large national study, only 42 percent of bereaved family members whose loved one died in a SNF reported the quality of care as excellent compared with 71 percent of family members whose loved one was home with hospice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].</p><p>One study found that the quality of care of dying SNF patients improved with the addition of hospice, with the percent of families rating physical symptom control as good or excellent rising from 64 to 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. Hospice use in the SNF has been rising, increasing from 14 percent in 1999 to 33 percent in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].

Rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations are now included in the 5-Star quality rating system, and SNFs have financial incentives to reduce potentially preventable readmissions. In addition, value-based reimbursement strategies, such as Accountable Care Organizations and bundled payments, incentivize the reduction of unnecessary emergency department visits and hospitalizations.</p><p>Rates of rehospitalization are even higher for patients discharged to SNFs than for other patients discharged from hospitals, reaching 25 percent within 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>], and it has been estimated that as many as 69 percent of the readmissions from such facilities are potentially (probably or definitely) avoidable with high-quality skilled care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. Care transitions are particularly burdensome for residents with advanced dementia. One study of care transitions prior to death in 475,000 SNF patients with advanced dementia found burdensome transitions (transfers in the last three days of life, lack of continuity in nursing homes in the last 90 days of life, or multiple hospitalizations in the last 90 days of life) occurred in 20 percent of those studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-care-in-skilled-nursing-facilities-snfs-in-the-united-states/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients entering a skilled nursing facility (SNF) should undergo comprehensive geriatric assessment. In SNFs in the United States, the Minimum Data Set (MDS) is a tool for the comprehensive evaluation of residents at the time of admission, as well as quarterly reassessment for long-term residents, and serves as a basis for development of individual treatment plans. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Comprehensive geriatric assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26429831\" class=\"local\">'The Minimum Data Set'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral issues can be difficult challenges in the SNF setting. Delirium is often unrecognized and should be considered as a potential cause of disruptive behavior. Delirium requires assessing for and managing underlying medical conditions, including electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, pain, and infection. Although antipsychotic agents are considered chemical restraints and their use is carefully scrutinized in the SNF, psychotic symptoms and aggressive behaviors may need to be managed with psychotropic medications, typically atypical antipsychotic medications. (See <a href=\"#H6972786\" class=\"local\">'Delirium'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1778439143\" class=\"local\">'Behavioral issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression is widespread and undertreated in SNFs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) are the drug of choice, and tricyclic antidepressants should be avoided due to the high risk of anticholinergic effects. (See <a href=\"#H6972793\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falls are common in SNFs, and the risk of falls may be reduced by multidisciplinary interventions and by limiting medications that are associated with falls. (See <a href=\"#H6972832\" class=\"local\">'Falls'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SNF staff and patients should be vaccinated for influenza in the early fall. In the event of an influenza outbreak, exposed patients should receive antiviral prophylaxis. Additional infection control measures should be instituted, such as limiting movement between affected and unaffected units of the SNF and closing affected units to new admissions. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Influenza'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Debilitated patients who are treated with broad spectrum antibiotics are highly susceptible to developing <em>Clostridium difficile</em> diarrhea. When <em>C. difficile</em> is diagnosed in a patient with diarrhea, universal precautions should be supplemented with enteric precautions. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clostridium difficile'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain is common and often undertreated in the SNF setting. Pain at the end of life poses unique challenges; transdermal and sublingual preparations of opioids can be particularly useful in end-of-life care. (See <a href=\"#H6972850\" class=\"local\">'Pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unintentional weight loss is correlated with increased mortality and requires evaluation for reversible causes, such as depression, oral or neurologic issues, or medication side effects. There is no evidence that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes improve nutritional status or prolong life in the nursing home resident with advanced dementia. Oral nutritional supplements may be modestly helpful. (See <a href=\"#H6976530\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Policies to regularly offer fluids may prevent dehydration. When artificial hydration is indicated, subcutaneous fluid infusion may be an alternative to intravenous fluids. (See <a href=\"#H6976657\" class=\"local\">'Hydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure injury management requires an interdisciplinary approach. Patients with pressure injuries often are nutritionally compromised and may require increased protein intake for wound healing. (See <a href=\"#H6972866\" class=\"local\">'Pressure injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Care transitions accentuate the risks from polypharmacy. Pharmacists and clinicians should regularly review medication lists, with recognition that indications for treatment change as patient status changes. (See <a href=\"#H6972875\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of adverse drug events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in reimbursement and financial penalties are increasing pressure on SNFs to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations, 30-day readmissions, and emergency department visits. Multiple interventions are available to assist SNFs in achieving these goals. (See <a href=\"#H11661985\" class=\"local\">'Preventing unnecessary hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advance care planning is an important part of SNF care. In addition to addressing issues around resuscitation, residents should be given the option of limiting other interventions, as well as choosing not to be hospitalized in the event of illness. (See <a href=\"#H6972893\" class=\"local\">'Advance care planning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531685506\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Muriel Gillick, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Medicare Payment Advisory Committee.
