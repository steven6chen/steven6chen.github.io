Based largely upon the Ontario group analysis, an expert panel convened by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in 2004 concluded that direct evidence from randomized trials does not support the routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer.</p><p>A similar conclusion was reached in an Intergroup analysis that included pooled individual data from 3302 patients with stage II or III colon cancer who were enrolled in seven randomized trials comparing LV- or levamisole-modulated FU versus surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In multivariate analysis adjusted for T-stage, histologic grade, and nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a significant 30 percent relative reduction in the risk of recurrence and a 26 percent relative reduction in the risk of death. Treatment effects were consistent across all subsets, with similar risk reductions for stage II and III disease. For stage II disease, this benefit translated into a statistically significant improvement in five-year DFS favoring chemotherapy (76 versus 72 percent), but the difference in overall survival was not statistically significant (81 versus 76 percent, an absolute benefit of 5 percent).</p><p>A follow-up analysis of long-term outcomes of adjuvant therapy was conducted by the Adjuvant Colon Cancer End Points (ACCENT) collaboration. This analysis included the individual patient data from nine trials, seven of which were in the Intergroup analysis. Among the nearly 6900 patients with stage II cancer, adjuvant FU-based chemotherapy was associated with a 5 percent absolute improvement in survival at eight years (72 versus 66.8 percent, p = 0.026) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1055568461\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxaliplatin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term results from both the MOSAIC and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) C-07 (described in detail below) trials show that there is not any clinically meaningful benefit from the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> to adjuvant LV-modulated FU for patients with stage II colon cancer. This conclusion was also supported by a later analysis derived from the 12,233 patients enrolled in the five randomized trials that comprised the ACCENT database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Among patients with stage II disease, the addition of oxaliplatin significantly reduced the risk of recurrence within the first 14 months posttreatment but not thereafter, and there was no overall survival benefit.</p><p>However, for patients with high-risk stage II disease, such as T4b (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>) cancers, the considerable trend towards a disease-free survival (DFS) benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> in MOSIAC suggests that this subgroup might preferentially benefit. However, no trial has been adequately powered to address this specific question, and the addition of oxaliplatin cannot yet be considered a standard approach for any patient with stage II colon cancer. In our view, the option of an oxaliplatin-containing regimen could be discussed as an alternative to those patients with high-risk stage II disease. An oxaliplatin-containing regimen is a reasonable alternative to fluoropyrimidine therapy alone for patients with higher risk stage II disease whose tumor displays a high level of microsatellite <span class=\"nowrap\">instability/deficiency</span> of mismatch repair proteins.

Among patients with stage II cancer, five-year DFS was slightly but not significantly higher with FOLFOX (84 versus 80 percent, HR for recurrence 0.84, p = 0.26), but six-year overall survival was identical (87 percent in both treatment arms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The first is for purposes of obtaining stage-independent predictors of recurrence risk to help in adjuvant therapy decisions as mentioned above. The second completely separate reason is to screen patients for Lynch syndrome (HNPCC). Patients with Lynch syndrome have germline loss of expression of one of several MMR enzymes, resulting in a predisposition to colorectal cancer. Some experts currently recommend routine screening of <strong>all</strong> patients with colorectal cancer for Lynch syndrome, while others recommend selective testing focusing on patients who present at a young age (under the age of 50) or whose tumors have clinicopathologic features that suggest HNPCC; this is a controversial area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the rationale for performing the test, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the most commonly lost mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) can be used in place of the more cumbersome MSI testing (a polymerase chain reaction assay, which takes longer and is more expensive), particularly if the results will influence a decision on adjuvant therapy.

Several of these gene expression assays are available for clinical use in the United States for patients with stage II colon cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90005\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90005 \">table 4</a>). All of these tests have been shown to have prognostic value in independent patient series, though the design and sample numbers of the validation analyses have varied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. The best documented and validated tool is the 12-gene recurrence score (Oncotype-DX Colon Cancer Assay). None of the five commercially available assays, including the 12-gene recurrence score, has specific US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in stage II colon cancer. Furthermore, none of these assays has been able to predict which patients with stage II disease could benefit from adjuvant therapy. Preliminary data on a newer set of combinatory cancer hallmark-based gene signatures (eight signatures, 30 genes each) suggest not only prognostic value (five-year RFS for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk signature sets was 94, 78, and 45 percent, respectively), but also predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Patients in the high-risk prognostic group who receive FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy have a significant 30 to 40 percent reduction in the risk of recurrence; this benefit was not seen in the low-risk and intermediate-risk subgroups. While promising, a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved assay needs to be developed to ensure that these gene signatures are accurately and consistently determined for clinical decision making. Further, validation of the predictive benefit is needed in patients who are randomized to chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1055568575\"><span class=\"h4\">12-gene recurrence score and other microarray-based tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To develop an RS able to enhance prognostic information about recurrence risk for patients with stage II colon cancer, investigators assessed the association between colon cancer recurrence and expression of multiple genes in paraffin embedded tumor tissue from patients with stage II or III colon cancer treated on four different adjuvant therapy trials that included surgery only and FU arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. From an initial 761 candidate genes, 12 were selected based on their independent association with recurrence in each of the studies. From this initial study, patients with an RS &lt;30 had a three-year recurrence rate of 8 percent, patients with an RS 31 to 40 had a recurrence risk of 11 percent, and patients with RS &gt;40 had a recurrence rate of 25 percent at three years. The ability of this 12-gene assay to predict recurrence rate was independently validated in an analysis of data from the prospective QUASAR trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>], in a separate analysis of data from the CALGB 9581 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and in the SUNRISE study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. In the CALGB 9581 analysis, the RS appeared to be most discerning for patients with T3 tumors that were proficient for MMR enzymes, in whom the prespecified low- and high-RS groups had average five-year recurrence risks of 13 and 21 percent, respectively. Forty-four percent of patients with T3N0 pMMR tumors fell into the low-RS category and, thus, may have been spared from receiving chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H589530422\" class=\"local\">'MSI and MMR enzyme deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p>On the other hand, the added prognostic value provided by the 12-gene recurrence score and three other colon cancer recurrence score assays based upon microarray gene expression, including one from MD Anderson [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>], one from Veridex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>], and GeneFx colon (the licensed product of the ColDx test, which was developed by Almac Diagnostics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,121</a>], beyond that provided by established factors was called into question by an analysis of data from the PETACC-3 trial of adjuvant FU and LV with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. All four risk scores had a statistically significant association with both overall and RFS, but each could only marginally improve the prognostic value of a recurrence-free and overall survival model with the known factors of T-stage, N-stage, and MSI. A combination of the risk scores appeared to provide more robust prognostic information.</p><p>It is important to note that the 12-gene RS was created as a prognostic marker. While it may have the ability to better estimate a patient's risk of recurrence, whether such increased risk can be overcome by adjuvant chemotherapy is not clear. The original investigators did generate a separate &quot;treatment score&quot; that appeared to be predictive of FU benefit in stage II disease from the initial four study patient sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].
