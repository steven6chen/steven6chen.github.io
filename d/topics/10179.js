This infection is found most frequently in tropical and subtropical areas of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but has been increasingly reported among men who have sex with men (MSM) in temperate climates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. The diagnosis is difficult to establish on clinical grounds alone and frequently relies upon either serologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], culture, or more recently, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of direct specimens.</p><p>LGV will be reviewed here. Other manifestations of <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection are discussed separately.

Large outbreaks have been reported in Western Europe and North America, primarily in men who have sex with men (MSM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>], with the largest outbreak reports from New York City [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and the United Kingdom (UK) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The majority of these cases have presented as proctitis. A close epidemiologic link between the outbreaks in the Netherlands and New York City was suggested through molecular typing of the serovars.</p><p>The vast majority of MSM who have acquired LGV are also HIV-infected (76 percent in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This is a major public health concern since enhanced shedding of HIV during clinical proctitis could increase the risk of HIV transmission to uninfected men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the UK outbreak of 327 cases of LGV, 4 percent of the patients also had a new diagnosis of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thirty-nine percent had a diagnosis of another sexually transmitted infection and approximately 19 percent were also infected with hepatitis C virus.</p><p>Prior to the outbreaks in MSM, LGV was primarily endemic in heterosexuals in areas of East and West Africa, India, parts of Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean where it is manifested as the classic form of disease with genital ulcers and lymphadenopathy (without proctitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, LGV is not the predominant cause of genital ulcer disease in a number of these regions despite a high frequency of exposure as evidenced by <em>C. trachomatis</em> antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This was illustrated in a survey of 196 patients with genital ulcers from Madagascar, 79 percent of whom had chlamydial antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. LGV was confirmed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in only 16 (8 percent). This contrasted with much higher rates of infection with chancroid, syphilis, and HSV of 33, 29, and 10 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chancroid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chancroid&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H947750714\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Rates of LGV-related chlamydial pathogen recovery are higher in patients with inguinal buboes or HIV infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 113 men who were evaluated in Thailand, LGV was recovered in 12.8 percent and H. ducreyi in 28 percent of clinical specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an outbreak of genital ulcer disease in the Bahamas in 1990 to 1992 associated with crack cocaine use, 17 of 47 had either a definite or probable clinical diagnosis of LGV; 43 percent were HIV-infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As above, in outbreaks among MSM, HIV serostatus is strongly associated with risk of LGV. In one case control study of 87 MSM who had <em>C. trachomatis</em> serovar L2 compared to 377 MSM who had serovars A through K, HIV seropositivity was the strongest risk factor for LGV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the New York City and UK outbreaks noted above, HIV coinfection was found in 84 and 76 percent, respectively. Classical LGV disease, which is seen in tropical areas, is not highly associated with HIV.</p><p>Other independent risk factors have included concurrent ulcerative disease, a previously diagnosed sexually transmitted infection, unprotected anal sex, recent travel abroad, and meeting sex partners on the internet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/7,8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is predominantly a disease of lymphatic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In contrast to mucosal chlamydial infections in which inflammation is largely limited to the initial site of infection, the LGV serovars induce a lymphoproliferative reaction. This is usually accomplished through direct extension from the primary infection site to the draining lymph nodes. Both LGV serovars and other strains of <em>C. trachomatis</em> appear to bind to epithelial cells via heparan sulfate receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>When LGV spreads to produce a lymphangitis, areas of necrosis occur within the nodes, followed by abscess formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one study of 12 patients, lymph node macrophages contained organisms that stained black with Warthin-Starry stain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The organisms clustered within vacuoles and by electron microscopy, both reticulate and elementary bodies were visible. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the lymph nodes for LGV serovars of <em>C. trachomatis</em> was positive in nine of the 12 cases. The pathologic findings are compatible with LGV or <em>Bartonella</em> (ie, &quot;cat scratch&quot; disease), but are not diagnostic of either entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. One report describes a case of cat scratch disease that appeared to be LGV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The lymph node reaction may take several weeks to develop, and can result in substantial inflammation and subsequent fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a small number of cases, dissemination and systemic disease can occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGES OF INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three stages of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary infection is characterized by a genital ulcer or a mucosal inflammatory reaction at the site of inoculation. The incubation period is 3 to 12 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These lesions spontaneously heal within a few days. This stage of disease is often missed due to the small size of the ulcer, its location, and the lack of accompanying symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The secondary stage appears two to six weeks later and is related to local direct extension of the infection to regional lymph nodes (ie, inguinal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> femoral nodes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In contrast to the urogenital infections due to <em>C. trachomatis</em> (serovars A through K) that are often mild, LGV can cause severe inflammation and invasive infection, often with systemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inguinal syndrome occurs primarily in men and is an inflammatory reaction in the superficial and deep inguinal nodes, causing the characteristic &quot;groove&quot; sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61366\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61366 \">picture 1</a>). These may form buboes (unilateral painful inguinal lymph nodes) and rupture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An anorectal syndrome can also occur, which results in an inflammatory mass present in the rectum and retroperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients may present with symptoms of proctocolitis with rectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tenesmus. There may be hemorrhagic proctocolitis and hyperplasia of intestinal and perirectal lymphatic tissue. This can be mistaken for inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/4,5,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,22</a>].

Late complications include genital elephantiasis, anal fistulae and strictures, frozen pelvis, and infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is difficult because there is no characteristic clinical presentation, laboratory procedures for this pathogen are not well standardized, and serologic assessment has low specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/17,20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,25</a>] (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Serology'</a> below). However, nucleic acid amplification testing is available in many commercial and public health laboratories. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with genital disease, genital and lymph node specimens (eg, lesion swab or bubo aspirate) may be tested for <em>C. trachomatis</em> by culture, direct immunofluorescence, or nucleic acid detection.

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Nucleic acid amplification testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>However, differentiating the LGV from non-LGV serotypes of Chlamydia is challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and polymerase chain reaction-based methods that have been developed for this specific purpose are not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28</a>].</p><p>The clinical diagnosis of LGV proctitis might be suspected in men who have sex with men (MSM) who present with proctitis, enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, and the presence of anorectal ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These patients may present to a variety of providers, including primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, and surgeons. Taking an accurate sexual history, and thinking of the possibility of LGV, is key to making the diagnosis.</p><p>Rectal inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding is almost always present in symptomatic proctitis due to LGV. In the large United Kingdom outbreak, the major symptoms included rectal discharge (79 percent), pain (69 percent), rectal bleeding (58 percent), tenesmus (29 percent), constipation (25 percent); four percent of patients had concomitant urogenital LGV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In patients where the diagnosis is uncertain, a reasonable approach may be to obtain anoscopy with subsequent microscopic examination of visible areas of proctitis or ulcerative lesions, as noted in the following diagnostic algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50993\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50993 \">algorithm 1</a>). In one study, of 87 MSM with proven LGV, microscopic examination of Gram-stained anorectal smear specimens revealed greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">WBC/hpf</span> for the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This finding is not diagnostic, but may suggest the need for further studies. However, most patients have only microscopic disease with inflammation in the lamina propria and neutrophilic infiltration of crypts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a multitude of problems associated with attempts to culture the organism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the primary lesion is often missed, culture at this stage of infection is not frequently performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The yield is low from ulcers or lymph node aspirates; organisms are recovered only 30 percent of the time in the secondary phase of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chlamydia cultures are not generally available outside of referral centers.</p><p/><p>In the UK, culture has been widely used to diagnose non-LGV and LGV-chlamydia from rectal specimens. Current guidelines in the UK recommend typing of all chlamydial rectal isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic tests, complement fixation or microimmunofluorescence, are the most common means to diagnose LGV, but all have limitations since they do not distinguish the serotypes and are insensitive for diagnosis of isolated proctitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>]. A positive serologic test for IgG antibodies, in the presence of a compatible clinical syndrome, is considered supportive of a presumptive diagnosis of LGV. Most authorities suggest that a complement fixation titer &ge;1:64, or a microimmunofluorescence titer &gt;1:256, supports the diagnosis, while a titer of &lt;1:32 rules it out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>]. Serial titers demonstrating a titer rise are confirmatory. Microimmunofluorescence is more sensitive and specific than complement fixation, but neither test can distinguish recent from past infection. Thus, the results of serologic testing must be correlated with the clinical manifestations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Nucleic acid amplification testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genital lesions, rectal specimens, and lymph node specimens can be tested for <em>C. trachomatis </em>using nucleic acid detection techniques (NAAT). Although NAAT of rectal specimens is not currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, there is a growing body of research in this area that suggests a greater sensitivity and specificity using NAAT compared with culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced in the summer of 2006 that they had developed a new polymerase chain reaction test for the detection of chlamydial DNA specific for LGV as part of an epidemiologic investigation of LGV proctitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/16,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,31</a>]. The assay correctly identified 53 of 55 LGV specimens, 34 of 34 non-LGV chlamydial specimens, and 30 of 30 specimens with no chlamydial infection. The test turnaround time is rapid and testing can be performed on rectal and pharyngeal swab specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/6,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,32</a>]. Further work on commercially available Chlamydia assays demonstrated that NAAT tests have high sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Depending on which resources are available, clinicians should send rectal swabs to either their local or state laboratory initially. If rectal LGV is suspected (eg, in a high-risk MSM), public health authorities would be notified to assure appropriate management of the specimen. Decisions on whether the specimen should go to the CDC for additional testing are made in conjunction with local public health officials. At CDC, specimens will be tested for <em>C. trachomatis</em>, and if positive, will be genotyped for the identification of LGV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LGV is primarily endemic in heterosexuals in areas of East and West Africa, India, parts of Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. However, LGV has also been reported as a cause of proctitis in men who have sex with men (MSM) within large outbreaks in Western Europe and North America. Risk factors for LGV proctitis have included HIV infection (among MSM), concurrent ulcerative disease, prior history of sexually transmitted infections, unprotected anal sex, recent travel abroad, and meeting sex partners on the internet. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to mucosal chlamydial infections, in which inflammation is largely limited to the initial site of infection, the LGV serovars induce a lymphoproliferative reaction. This is usually accomplished through direct extension from the primary infection site to the draining lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary infection is characterized by a genital ulcer at the site of inoculation. The secondary stage appears two to six weeks later and is related to local direct extension of the infection to regional lymph nodes (ie, inguinal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> femoral nodes). An anorectal syndrome can also occur, which results in an inflammatory mass in the rectum and retroperitoneum. Patients with proctocolitis may present with rectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, and or tenesmus. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Stages of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If LGV is not recognized and treated, fibrosis and strictures can form in the anogenital tract leading to genital elephantiasis, anal fistulae and strictures, frozen pelvis, and infertility. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Late lymphogranuloma venereum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of LGV is difficult because there is no characteristic clinical presentation, cultures have low yield, and serologic assessment has low specificity. However, some laboratories are performing nucleic acid amplification testing for LGV, which is highly sensitive and specific. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acute proctocolitis should be evaluated for Chlamydia, <em>Neisseria gonorrhea</em>, and syphilis. For patients with a clinical syndrome consistent with LGV proctocolitis, empiric therapy including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg orally twice daily for seven days) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (250 mg given once intramuscularly) should be administered while awaiting results of laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy for proctitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with LGV, United States and European guidelines state that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg orally twice daily for 21 days) is the preferred treatment for LGV. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azithromycin</a> (1 g orally once weekly for three weeks), which is highly active against serovars of <em>C. trachomatis</em> that cause cervicitis and urethritis, may be effective in LGV as well. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buboes may require needle aspiration or incision and drainage to avoid rupture or sinus tract formation. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Aspiration of buboes'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients diagnosed with LGV should be tested for HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphogranuloma-venereum/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Workowski KA, Bolan GA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
