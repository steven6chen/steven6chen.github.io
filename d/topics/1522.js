This can be uncomfortable or make sex painful. Atrophic vaginitis is sometimes called &quot;vaginal atrophy.&quot;</p><p>Atrophic vaginitis happens when a woman does not make enough of a hormone called estrogen. This condition mainly affects women who have been through menopause (meaning they have stopped having a monthly period). It can also happen to women whose ovaries were removed, who are taking certain medicines, or who are nursing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2775888\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of atrophic vaginitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal dryness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal burning or irritation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making less lubrication during sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain during sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding when something touches or rubs the vagina, for example, after sex. (If you have this symptom, be sure to see a doctor.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal discharge (leaking fluid from the vagina)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary problems, such as having to urinate often, having pain with urination, or having blood in the urine. (If you have these symptoms, be sure to see a doctor.)</p><p/><p>Some women never tell their doctor they are having symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. Often they are embarrassed or think the symptoms are a normal part of aging. If you have symptoms of this condition, and they bother you, mention it to your doctor or nurse. There are treatments that can help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2775903\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for atrophic vaginitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2775918\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some women feel better if they use lubricants before sex and use a vaginal moisturizer, such as Replens or K-Y SILK-E, several times a week. Vaginal moisturizers are not the same as lubricants. They help keep the vagina moist all the time, not just during sex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2775932\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you have symptoms of atrophic vaginitis and they bother you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2775962\"><span class=\"h1\">How is atrophic vaginitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective treatment for atrophic vaginitis is the hormone estrogen. When using estrogen to treat atrophic vaginitis, doctors recommend &quot;vaginal estrogen.&quot; Vaginal estrogen is any form of estrogen that goes directly into the vagina. It comes in creams, tablets, or a flexible ring. Vaginal estrogen comes in small doses that don't increase the levels of estrogen in other parts of the body very much. Some women who take vaginal estrogen must also take another hormone, called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">progesterone</a>.</p><p>Estrogen also comes in higher doses in a pill that you swallow, a skin patch, or a different vaginal ring. These are sometimes called &quot;hormone replacement therapy,&quot; and need to be taken with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">progesterone</a>. But vaginal estrogen is better for treating symptoms of atrophic vaginitis.</p><p>If you want to take estrogen, ask your doctor or nurse what the possible risks and benefits are for you. If you have had breast or uterine cancer, or if you are at risk for these cancers, ask whether hormones are safe for you.</p><p>Besides estrogen, there are also 2 other medicines that can treat atrophic vaginitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ospemifene-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Ospemifene</a> (brand name: Osphena) is similar to estrogen, but is not estrogen. It comes as a pill you take once a day. It can cause hot flashes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prasterone, also called dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), is a medicine that you put into your vagina once a day. It comes as a &quot;suppository,&quot; which is similar to a tablet or pill but goes directly into the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2775947\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyspareunia-painful-sex-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dyspareunia (painful sex) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopause-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Menopause (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvar pain (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopause-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Menopause (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-dryness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal dryness (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Menopausal hormone therapy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adult-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adult women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
