The medical term for pink eye is &quot;conjunctivitis.&quot;</p><p>If you have pink eye, your eye (or eyes) might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turn pink or red</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weep or ooze a gooey liquid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Become itchy or burn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get stuck shut, especially when you first wake up</p><p/><p>Pink eye can be caused by an infection, allergies, or an unknown irritation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482219659\"><span class=\"h1\">Can you catch pink eye from someone else?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. When pink eye is caused by an infection, it can spread easily. Usually, people catch it from touching something that has been in contact with an infected person's eye. It can also be spread when an infected person touches someone else, and then that person touches his or her eyes.</p><p>If you know someone with pink eye, avoid touching his or her pillowcases, towels, or other personal items.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482219666\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I see my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if your eye hurts, or if you still have trouble seeing clearly after blinking. If you do not have these problems, but think you might have pink eye, your doctor or nurse might be able to give you advice over the phone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482219673\"><span class=\"h1\">Can pink eye be treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of pink eye go away on their own without treatment. But some types of pink eye can be treated.</p><p>When pink eye is caused by infection, it is usually caused by a virus, so antibiotics will <strong>not</strong> help. Still, pink eye caused by a virus can last several days. Pink eye caused by an infection with bacteria can be treated with antibiotic eye drops or gels. Pink eye caused by other problems can be treated with eye drops normally used to treat allergies. These drops will not cure the pink eye, but they can help with itchiness and irritation.</p><p>When using eye drops for infection, do not touch your good eye after touching your affected eye, and do not touch the bottle or dropper directly in one eye and then use it in the other. Doing these things can cause the infection to spread from one eye to the other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482219680\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I wear contact lenses?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you wear contact lenses and you have symptoms of pink eye, it is really important to have a doctor look at your eyes. In people who wear contacts, the symptoms of pink eye can be caused by &quot;corneal abrasion.&quot; Corneal abrasion is a scratch on the eye and can be a serious problem.</p><p>During treatment for eye infections, you might need to stop wearing your contacts for a short time. If your contacts are disposable, you will want to throw them away and start fresh. If you contacts are not disposable, you will need to carefully clean them. You should also throw away your contact lens case and get a new one.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482219687\"><span class=\"h1\">Can pink eye be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To keep from getting or spreading pink eye, wash your hands often with soap and water. If washing is not possible, alcohol-based hand gels work, too. Also, avoid sharing towels, bedding, or other personal items with a person who has pink eye.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H482219694\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis-pink-eye-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Conjunctivitis (pink eye) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-conjunctivitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Allergic conjunctivitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pterygium-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pterygium (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
