Only someone trained in mental health can tell for sure if you are depressed.</p><p>If you ever feel like you might hurt yourself, go straight to the nearest emergency department. Or you can <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> or call your doctor or nurse <strong>right away</strong> and tell them it is an emergency. You can also reach the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or <a href=\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/&amp;token=/J1rHW7kKTZQWUm+m7pp17qQkeqNOj1EQkYbz1F99iKcK0Zp+4r1rJsDeHAD0BNt&amp;TOPIC_ID=15429\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470671238\"><span class=\"h1\">How do medicines help you stop smoking?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different medicines work in different ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nicotine<strong> </strong>replacement therapy eases withdrawal and reduces your body's craving for nicotine, the main drug found in cigarettes. There are different forms of nicotine replacement, including skin patches, lozenges, gum, nasal sprays, and &quot;puffers&quot; or inhalers. Many can be bought without a prescription, while others might require one.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Bupropion</a> is a prescription medicine that reduces your desire to smoke. This medicine is sold under the brand names Zyban and Wellbutrin. It is also available in a generic version, which is cheaper than brand name medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Varenicline</a> (brand names: Chantix, Champix) is a prescription medicine that reduces withdrawal symptoms and cigarette cravings. If you think you'd like to take varenicline and you have a history of depression, anxiety, or heart disease, discuss this with your doctor or nurse before taking the medicine. Varenicline can also increase the effects of alcohol in some people. It's a good idea to limit drinking while you're taking it, at least until you know how it affects you.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470671245\"><span class=\"h1\">How does counseling work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Counseling can happen during formal office visits or just over the phone. A counselor can help you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Figure out what triggers your smoking and what to do instead</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overcome cravings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Figure out what went wrong when you tried to quit before</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470671252\"><span class=\"h1\">What works best?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies show that people have the best luck at quitting if they take medicines to help them quit <strong>and</strong> work with a counselor. It might also be helpful to combine nicotine replacement with one of the prescription medicines that help people quit. In some cases, it might even make sense to take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">bupropion</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">varenicline</a> together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1337188286\"><span class=\"h1\">What about e-cigarettes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes people wonder if using electronic cigarettes, or &quot;e-cigarettes,&quot; might help them quit smoking. Using e-cigarettes is also called &quot;vaping.&quot; Doctors do not recommend e-cigarettes in place of medicines and counseling. That's because e-cigarettes still contain nicotine as well as other substances that might be harmful. It's not clear how they can affect a person's health in the long term.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470671259\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I gain weight if I quit?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you might gain a few pounds. But quitting smoking will have a much more positive effect on your health than weighing a few pounds more. Plus, you can help prevent some weight gain by being more active and eating less. Taking the medicine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">bupropion</a> might help control weight gain. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470671266\"><span class=\"h1\">What else can I do to improve my chances of quitting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start exercising.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay away from smokers and places that you associate with smoking. If people close to you smoke, ask them to quit with you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep gum, hard candy, or something to put in your mouth handy. If you get a craving for a cigarette, try one of these instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Don't give up, even if you start smoking again. It takes most people a few tries before they succeed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470671273\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant and I smoke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant, it's really important for the health of your baby that you quit. Ask your doctor what options you have, and what is safest for your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470671280\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-risks-to-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Secondhand smoke: Risks to children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=smoking-in-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Smoking in pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lung cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Depression (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
