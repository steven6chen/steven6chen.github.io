Each hair follicle sits above a dermal papilla, a collection of mesenchymal tissue with inductive properties (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53952 \">figure 1</a>). The dermal papilla induces the development of hair follicles in the fetus and appears to play an important role in follicular cycling and hair growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1871661\" class=\"local\">'Hair cycle'</a> below.)</p><p>Hair follicles consist of four segments: the bulb, suprabulbar region, isthmus, and infundibulum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53952 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The bulb, the lowest portion of the hair follicle, is the site of the hair matrix, a group of rapidly proliferating keratinocytes responsible for the production of hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The suprabulbar region of the follicle extends from the bulb to the isthmus, which is the portion of the follicle between the insertion of the arrector pili muscle and the insertion of the sebaceous gland. The uppermost portion of the follicle, the infundibulum, extends from the insertion of the sebaceous gland to the interfollicular epithelium.</p><p>The hair shaft is a layered structure that consists of three major components. The medulla, the innermost layer, is surrounded by the cortex and cuticle. Between the hair bulb and the isthmus, the hair shaft is surrounded by the inner root sheath, a structure that is composed of the cuticle of the inner root sheath, Huxley layer, Henle layer, and companion layer. The inner root sheath plays an important role in the shaping of the hair shaft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The outer root sheath surrounds both the inner root sheath and the hair shaft and extends from the hair bulb to the epidermis. The outer root sheath and each of the components of the hair shaft and inner root sheath have distinct keratin profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>A region near the insertion of the arrector pili muscle, referred to as the bulge region of the hair follicle, has been identified as a site that harbors hair follicle stem cells that are essential for follicular cycling and hair growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The loss of the hair follicle stem cells in the bulge is postulated to contribute to permanent loss of hair in cicatricial alopecias (see <a href=\"#H1871427\" class=\"local\">'Cicatricial alopecia'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Mouse studies have demonstrated that hair follicle stem cells may also support wound healing by contributing to repopulation of interfollicular epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1871675\"><span class=\"h2\">Hair types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major types of hair follicles on the human body are terminal hair follicles and vellus hair follicles. Terminal hair follicles are larger than vellus hair follicles and extend into the subcutaneous fat (2 to 5 mm from the skin surface) during hair growth. In contrast, the lowest portions of vellus hair follicles generally extend only into the reticular dermis. Hairs produced by terminal hair follicles are usually at least 0.06 mm in diameter while vellus hairs are short, fine, and usually less than 0.03 mm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The term &quot;intermediate hairs&quot; has been used to describe hairs with characteristics that are between vellus and terminal hairs (0.03 to 0.06 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>At birth, terminal hairs are found on the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes, and vellus hairs populate the remaining hair-bearing areas. During puberty, vellus hairs in certain areas, such as the genital area and axilla, are stimulated to become terminal hairs. Transitioning between terminal and vellus hair follicles may also occur in pathologic states. Abnormal transitioning of vellus hairs to terminal hairs occurs in hirsutism in women, and transitioning of terminal hairs to vellus hairs (follicular miniaturization) is a classic feature of androgenetic alopecia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and causes of hirsutism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Androgenetic alopecia in men: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia in women): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1871661\"><span class=\"h2\">Hair cycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once formed, hair follicles undergo lifelong cycling characterized by periods of growth (anagen), transformation (catagen), and rest (telogen). In humans, hair cycling is not synchronous, meaning that individual follicles cycle independently, preventing en mass shedding of hair. Although the lower portion of the hair follicle undergoes growth and regression during cycling, the isthmus and infundibulum remain stable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anagen </strong>&ndash; At any given time, approximately 90 percent of scalp hair follicles are in the anagen phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The rate of hair growth and the duration of anagen vary with the type of hair and location. On the scalp, the growth rate of terminal hair is approximately 0.3 mm per day and the duration of anagen ranges from two to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. In contrast, eyebrow hair grows only at a rate of 0.1 mm per day and has an anagen phase of two to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. The abbreviated anagen phase accounts for the relatively short maximum length of eyebrow hair. Similarly, a short anagen phase is responsible for the short maximum length of vellus hairs (typically less than 20 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Catagen </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>During catagen, the lower portion of the hair follicle regresses and hair production ceases. The deepest part of the hair follicle tracts upward toward the isthmus, and the dermal papilla migrates from within the subcutaneous fat into the reticular dermis. The duration of catagen on the scalp is usually around three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Less than 1 percent of follicles on the scalp are in catagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Telogen </strong>&ndash; The telogen phase, also known as the resting phase, follows catagen and lasts for two to three months on the scalp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Normally, up to 10 percent of scalp follicles are in telogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Telogen is characterized by the presence of a club hair (a fully keratinized hair with a club-shaped proximal end) that is ready for shedding from the hair follicle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50528 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The term &quot;exogen&quot; has been used to describe the exact time point at which the hair is shed. Normally, between 50 and 150 telogen hairs are shed per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Anagen follows the telogen phase, resulting in the production of a new hair. Prolongation of the telogen phase, as may occur in telogen effluvium, can result in a reduction in hair density due to a failure of follicles to reenter anagen following shedding. The term &quot;kenogen&quot; has been used to describe a delay in the entry into anagen following shedding of a telogen hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H638327\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hair loss disorders are a large, heterogenous group of conditions that have various clinical features, pathologic findings, and etiologies. Hair loss may occur due to disorders of hair cycling, inflammatory conditions that damage hair follicles, or inherited or acquired abnormalities in hair shafts.</p><p>The major dividing lines for the various forms of hair loss are the distinction between cicatricial (scarring) alopecia, nonscarring alopecia, and structural hair disorders. Cicatricial alopecias are conditions that lead to the irreversible cessation of hair cycling and permanent hair loss. As noted above, the loss of hair follicle stem cells in the bulge region of the hair follicle is thought to contribute to the development of cicatricial alopecia (see <a href=\"#H1871668\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above). In nonscarring alopecias, the hair follicle is not permanently damaged, making spontaneous or treatment-induced regrowth a possibility. Structural hair disorders that lead to hair loss demonstrate abnormalities within the hair shafts that result in hair fragility. (See <a href=\"#H638369\" class=\"local\">'Scalp and hair examination'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1871427\"><span class=\"h2\">Cicatricial alopecia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary cicatricial alopecias are inflammatory disorders of the scalp that lead to permanent hair loss. The primary cicatricial alopecias are subdivided by the type of inflammation detected on histologic examination. The three major classes are lymphocytic primary cicatricial alopecias, neutrophilic primary cicatricial alopecias, and mixed primary cicatricial alopecias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Examples of the primary cicatricial alopecias are provided below. A summary of the clinical and histologic features of the cicatricial alopecias is provided in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F88347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88347 \">table 1A</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphocytic primary cicatricial alopecia</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Alopecia mucinosa </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Alopecia mucinosa (also known as follicular mucinosis) may result in scarring or nonscarring alopecia. Permanent hair loss results from the replacement of hair follicles by mucin, rather than from fibrosis. Patients usually present with erythematous or skin-colored indurated plaques of alopecia on the face or scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87485\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87485 \">picture 1</a>). Follicular papules may also be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two types of alopecia mucinosa have been described, idiopathic alopecia mucinosa and alopecia mucinosa that occurs as a manifestation of mycosis fungoides or cutaneous T cell lymphoma. However, some authors believe that these disorders may represent aspects of a single disease spectrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Whether all cases designated as idiopathic alopecia mucinosa are actually indolent forms of mycosis fungoides remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Alopecia occurs on the crown of the scalp and gradually progresses in a centrifugal manner to the parietal areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87198\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87198 \">picture 2</a>). Perifollicular hyperpigmentation and the emergence of multiple hairs from a single follicle may be present.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-planus#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lichen planus&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Obtaining a family history of similar hair loss can be useful because genetics play a role in susceptibility to multiple hair diseases. Sometimes patients will deny a family history of hair loss because their parents were not fully bald. Asking about both hair thinning and balding is helpful for identifying a family history of alopecia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H638362\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination of the patient with a complaint of scalp hair loss involves the examination of the scalp, hair, and other body sites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H638369\"><span class=\"h2\">Scalp and hair examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, the scalp and hair examination should be performed with the patient in a position that allows the clinician to examine the scalp from above comfortably, such as the clinician in a standing position and the patient seated in a chair. Good lighting is essential. Examination techniques such as trichoscopy and the hair pull test may be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88147727\"><span class=\"h3\">Visual inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step of the physical examination consists of inspection of the entire scalp for physical clues that may aid with diagnosis, such as erythema, scales, papules, pustules, erosions, or excoriations. The presence or absence of follicular ostia (the pinpoint openings from which hair emerges from the scalp) within affected areas also should be noted; <strong>a lack of follicular ostia suggests a scarring alopecia</strong>. Among the primary cicatricial alopecias, pustules are most likely to be seen in neutrophilic or mixed cicatricial alopecias. </p><p>The examination of the hair should include an assessment of the distribution and density of hair on the scalp to identify the pattern and degree of hair loss. Hair density is best assessed by parting the hair and noting the amount of space between the parts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Comparing the frontal hair density to the occipital hair density is particularly useful for female pattern hair loss. In female pattern hair loss, hair density on the frontal and vertex scalp is reduced, while hair on the occipital scalp is relatively spared. A Christmas-tree-like pattern of hair loss (with a wider part at the frontal hairline) is often evident in the involved area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87194%7EDERM%2F87195\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87194 graphicRef87195 \">picture 15A-B</a>).

Distinguishing between terminal and vellus hairs is particularly helpful for the diagnosis of male and female pattern hair loss, disorders in which terminal hairs transition to vellus hairs. Broken hairs, which suggest a structural hair disorder, may also be noted during this step. Hair fragility can be further assessed by grasping a cluster of hair fibers in two places and tugging in opposite directions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Features associated with certain forms of hair loss may also be detected during examination of the hair and may aid in diagnosis. Examples include exclamation point hairs in alopecia areata (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65864\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65864 \">picture 27</a>), tufted folliculitis in folliculitis decalvans and other cicatricial alopecias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87489\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87489 \">picture 7B</a>), follicular plugging in discoid lupus erythematosus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72588\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72588 \">picture 3A</a>), and keratotic follicular papules in lichen planopilaris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F52848\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52848 \">picture 5B</a>).</p><p>A tool that can be helpful during the hair examination is a small piece of white or black paper. The color should contrast with the color of the patient's hair (eg, white paper for a patient with dark hair). Placing the paper behind the hairs being examined facilitates visualization of the hairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This procedure also is helpful for differentiating the tapered tips of regrowing hairs from the blunt tips of broken or cut hairs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933990664\"><span class=\"h3\">Trichoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermoscopy, a technique in which a handheld magnifier is used to visualize skin structures, can aid in the examination of patients with hair loss.

It is important to consider that patients with hair loss may have concerns about pulling out additional hair; therefore, good communication is essential. </p><p>To perform the test, 50 to 60 hair fibers are grasped close to the skin surface and tugged from the proximal to the distal end. The easy extraction of more than six hair fibers suggests the presence of active hair loss. The proximal ends of hairs obtained by the hair pull test can be microscopically examined to determine the type of hairs removed (eg, telogen, anagen, dystrophic, or broken hairs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50528 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H638390\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination of other sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some hair loss disorders are associated with abnormalities in areas other than the scalp. Depending on the disorder, additional hair, nail, skin, tooth, or other abnormalities may be seen.

For patients with hair breakage, microscopic examination of the hair shaft may identify structural abnormalities that contribute to hair fragility (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87473%7EDERM%2F87475%7EDERM%2F87478%7EDERM%2F87480%7EDERM%2F87483\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87473 graphicRef87475 graphicRef87478 graphicRef87480 graphicRef87483 \">picture 21A-E</a>); this is done by cutting hairs close to the scalp surface. </p><p>The use of 1 to 2 drops of a mounting medium (eg, Permount) when placing the hair shafts between a glass slide and a coverslip optimizes the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Examinations for pili torti are an exception; the shadows and twists of pili torti are best visualized when the hair is examined dry, without a mounting medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Of note, microscopic examination under polarized light is necessary for visualization of the &quot;tiger-tail&quot; pattern seen in patients with trichothiodystrophy.

Scalp biopsies can distinguish scarring from nonscarring alopecia, and can provide information that further narrows the differential diagnosis. We perform scalp biopsies to confirm the diagnosis in all patients with cicatricial alopecia. Scalp biopsies are not usually performed for the diagnosis of hair shaft disorders due to the ability to diagnose these disorders with light microscopic examination of the hair shaft. However, in genetic structural hair disorders, abnormalities also may be evident when the intrafollicular portion of the hair shaft is seen on histologic examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19632457\"><span class=\"h3\">Cicatricial alopecia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with suspected cicatricial alopecia, scalp biopsies for diagnosis should be performed in sites of active disease. Features that suggest sites of active disease include the presence of primary lesions, symptoms, or a positive pull test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The peripheral margin of an area of alopecia usually is the preferred site for a biopsy. Some hair should remain in the biopsy site; areas of end-stage, complete balding should be avoided.</p><p>Many dermatopathologists prefer to receive two punch biopsy specimens, since this allows for evaluation of the tissue in both vertical and transverse sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We usually perform two 4 mm punch biopsies. If only one biopsy can be performed, transverse sections are preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The punch biopsies should be performed at an angle that mimics the direction of hair growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Punch biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>The vascular nature of the scalp can lead to significant bleeding during surgical procedures.

However, when the diagnosis remains uncertain, scalp biopsies can be useful for ruling in or ruling out certain diagnoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F88347%7EDERM%2F88346\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88347 graphicRef88346 \">table 1A-B</a>). Pathologic assessment of the proportion of anagen, catagen, and telogen follicles; the proportion of terminal and vellus hairs; the follicular structure; and the degree of inflammation can aid in distinguishing among the different types of nonscarring alopecia and can provide important information for treatment selection and setting patient expectations. Scalp biopsies are particularly useful for distinguishing among the diffuse presentations of alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, and female pattern hair loss.</p><p>A single scalp biopsy processed with transverse sections usually is sufficient for the evaluation of patients with clinical features suggestive of nonscarring alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93848306\"><span class=\"h2\">Trichograms and phototrichograms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trichograms and phototrichograms are techniques for the evaluation of nonscarring hair loss that are primarily used in research studies and specialized hair centers. Trichograms and phototrichograms can be used to assist with diagnosis and following the response to treatment.</p><p>To perform a trichogram, approximately 25 to 50 hairs are grasped close to the scalp with a needle holder. The hairs are then sharply plucked from the scalp. Following this, the proximal ends of the hairs are microscopically examined to evaluate the proportion of hairs in each stage of the hair cycle and to determine whether dystrophic hairs are present.</p><p>A phototrichogram is a less traumatic procedure in which hairs in a defined area are clipped to a length of approximately 1 mm and photographed. This baseline photograph can be used to assess hair density and the proportion of vellus, intermediate, and terminal hairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The same site is photographed two to three days after the initial photograph to assess hair growth. Since only anagen hairs grow substantially, catagen hairs elongate only slightly, and telogen hairs remain stable, the proportion of anagen, catagen, and telogen (resting) hairs can be estimated by comparing the two photographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Phototrichogram technology has evolved to include contrast-enhanced phototrichograms. Contrast-enhanced phototrichograms involve the use of high-resolution photography and hair dye that augments the contrast between hair color and skin color [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In addition, a software-based system for performing phototrichograms (TrichoScan) has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93848324\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the type of hair loss suspected, serologic and microbiologic studies may also be useful for obtaining information to support the diagnosis and to detect associated disorders. For patients with new-onset diffuse, nonscarring hair loss without a clear cause, an initial laboratory evaluation focused on identifying potential causes can be performed. Suggested initial laboratory tests for the primary care setting include thyroid stimulating hormone to assess for thyroid disease as well as serum iron and ferritin to assess for iron deficiency. In addition, a rapid plasma reagin test to rule out syphilitic alopecia is appropriate for patients with patchy hair loss without visible inflammation or scarring.</p><p>Laboratory evaluation for hyperandrogenism can be beneficial for women presenting with both pattern hair loss and other signs of hyperandrogenism, and testing for thyroid stimulating hormone is typically performed for patients with alopecia areata, based upon an association of alopecia areata with thyroid disease. The suggested laboratory work up for specific forms of alopecia is discussed in detail in dedicated topic reviews in UpToDate.

At any given time, 90 percent of hair follicles on the scalp are in anagen. The duration of the anagen phase determines maximum length of hair growth.

When not treated early, cicatricial alopecias are characterized by irreversible damage to the hair follicle that results in permanent hair loss. The primary cicatricial alopecias are subdivided into lymphocytic, neutrophilic, and mixed inflammatory disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F88347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88347 \">table 1A</a>).
