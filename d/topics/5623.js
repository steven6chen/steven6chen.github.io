Small variations in the administered dose can lead to severe and life-threatening toxicity in some individuals and underdosing in others, which may compromise cancer outcomes. Proper dose selection is of great importance, particularly in individuals with potentially curable diseases such as lymphoma or testicular cancer, and in the setting of adjuvant treatment (eg, breast and colon cancer). Selection of the right dose is complicated by the fact that individuals have a highly variable capacity to metabolize and eliminate drugs.</p><p>The most relevant pharmacokinetic parameter for drug exposure is the area under the curve (AUC) of plasma concentration x time following a single dose. During drug development, drug level sampling at multiple time points helps define the relationship between drug administration and the AUC. The AUC is influenced by external factors such as drug dose and schedule, as well as patient-specific factors such as age, gender, height, weight, concomitant medications and habits, genetics (inherited variations in drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drug targets), and clearance (which depends upon renal and hepatic function). As a result, there is much interindividual variation in the AUC following a single dose of a drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For most anticancer agents, attempts to minimize interindividual variation have been limited to normalizing doses based on body size (weight, body surface area [BSA]).</p><p>This topic will address issues related to dosing of anticancer agents in adults, including BSA-based dosing, which is used for most cytotoxic agents, weight-based dosing (eg, as is done for some cytotoxic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> and several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies), fixed dose prescribing (as is done for oral targeted agents such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKIs]), AUC-based dosing (as is done for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>), and pharmacogenetic as well as pharmacokinetic-guided dosing, including therapeutic drug monitoring. Dosing of anticancer agents in patients with renal or hepatic failure, and issues pertinent to dosing in the elderly are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The starting dose for conventional cytotoxic agents in phase I studies has generally been based upon animal studies, where doses are usually escalated until the LD10 is reached (the dose that results in lethality in 10 percent of the treated animals). By convention, in human phase I studies, the first dose employed has been one-tenth of the LD10.</p><p>Based upon the theory and intuitive belief that larger patients have a larger volume of distribution and a higher metabolizing capacity, it has been assumed that they require more drug to induce the same effects. In an attempt to minimize interindividual variation, dosing for most anticancer agents has generally been normalized using mg of drug per m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area (BSA), which is calculated using a patient's height and weight. </p><p>However, normalization of doses based upon BSA does not account for most of the interindividual variation in drug exposure. For cytotoxic agents, interindividual variability in drug clearance based upon the area under the curve (AUC) is expressed as the percent coefficient of variation (which is the standard deviation divided by the mean, times 100). Values of 25 to 70 percent are very common despite the use of BSA for individual dose calculation. (See <a href=\"#H355242408\" class=\"local\">'Body surface area (BSA)-based dosing'</a> below.)</p><p>More recently, given the trajectory towards &quot;personalized medicine,&quot; pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic-based dosing strategies have received more attention, though these approaches are not yet in widespread use. (See <a href=\"#H390293897\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacogenetics, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Suggested regimen'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H777077044\"><span class=\"h3\">Importance of dose intensity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historical data on optimal dosing for most existing cytotoxic agents have been generated using dose considerations that are derived from the &quot;maximum tolerated dose&quot; concept, irrespective of an individual&rsquo;s genetic constitution. The concept is that cytotoxic chemotherapy agents are administered at the maximum dose that an individual can tolerate before the onset of severe and even life-threatening toxicity. This dose, which is derived from phase I trials, is one dose level below that associated with dose-limiting toxicity and is termed the &quot;maximum tolerated dose.&quot; This dose is used for subsequent phase II and III trials testing antitumor efficacy.</p><p>This approach is supported by a series of retrospective analyses indicating that the greater the dose intensity of an individual drug, the better the outcome. Dose intensity, defined as the amount of chemotherapy delivered per unit time, has been recognized as an important determinant of efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy in theoretical models, in vitro studies, and clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The clinical data are strongest for breast cancer, in which prospective studies have demonstrated inferior outcomes for patients who receive lower than intended dose intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>] and better outcomes with dose-dense as compared with non-dose-dense therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer#H31949408\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Importance of chemotherapy schedule'</a>.)</p><p>Another line of evidence supporting the importance of dose intensity in oncologic outcomes is derived from the use of hematologic toxicity as a surrogate marker for efficacy and the delivery of effective chemotherapy doses. Retrospective analyses of clinical trials in lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and ovarian [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] cancer demonstrate inferior outcomes in patients who lack significant hematologic toxicity from myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The practice of giving higher drug doses to individuals who lack significant treatment-related toxicity seems logical given the correlation between lack of toxicity and low drug concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. However, despite its logical appeal, there have been limited trials testing this concept, and it has not been widely adopted or endorsed in clinical practice. In contrast, the practice of reducing doses based upon excess hematologic or other toxicity (eg, neurologic, gastrointestinal, or dermatologic) is widely accepted. In general, dose reduction for individual agents has been based upon criteria that were used in clinical trials, often an arbitrarily selected percentage of the initial starting dose.</p><p>Given the limited amount of high-quality evidence in this area, additional prospective trials are needed to assess whether drug dosing guided by the occurrence of toxic effects (pharmacodynamics) could improve efficacy of standard cytotoxic regimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H777077792\"><span class=\"h2\">Newer targeted therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been a paradigm shift in oncologic treatment away from the development of classic intravenously administered cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs toward so-called &quot;targeted therapies&quot; such as kinase inhibitors that are often administered orally on an ongoing daily basis, and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, which are dosed parenterally. Dose-limiting toxicities for targeted therapies are often markedly different from those of cytotoxic chemotherapy agents. In addition, when compared with classic cytotoxic agents, these novel agents show different relationships between levels of exposure, particularly exposure over time, and pharmacologic effects on the molecular drug target. Finally, these agents are characterized by unique mechanisms of action, and many are highly specific for single or multiple key cellular biological pathways implicated in carcinogenesis. Anticancer activity levels for therapies targeted against defined cellular and molecular markers significantly improve if patient pool enrichment is carried out based upon the presence of that specific marker in tumor tissue. Examples include tumor HER2 expression to select for treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>, and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) harboring an oncogenic <em>BCR-ABL</em> translocation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-her2-positive-metastatic-breast-cancer#H819017235\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'HER2-directed therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellular and molecular biology of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein'</a>.)</p><p>Whether the &quot;maximum tolerated dose&quot; paradigm is valid for anticancer agents with selectivity for a cancer-specific target (targeted therapies) is unclear. For these drugs, multiple approaches are being explored to develop alternative strategies for the identification of an optimal dose as opposed to the &quot;maximum tolerated dose&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At present, all of the orally active kinase inhibitors (most of which are tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKIs]), as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vemurafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vemurafenib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabrafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabrafenib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trametinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trametinib</a> (inhibitors of the BRAF <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine</span> protein kinase pathway), are dosed using a fixed dose schedule for all patients regardless of weight or BSA. By contrast, some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are given using a fixed dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofatumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofatumumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pertuzumab</a>), while others are dosed on a <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> basis (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panitumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">panitumumab</a>, brentuximab, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramucirumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramucirumab</a>), and still others are dosed according to BSA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>).

Although it is imperative to ensure that sufficiently high local drug concentrations are reached so as to maximize efficacy without exacerbating toxicity, the optimal way to achieve this goal is not yet apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For some drugs, biologic activity at the intended target can be used to select an appropriate dose. As an example, with the poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olaparib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olaparib</a>, biologic activity can be demonstrated by inhibition of the enzyme in tumor tissue. In phase I studies, biologic activity of olaparib was demonstrated with continuous twice-daily dosing at dose levels above 100 mg, demonstrating a maximum tolerated dose of 600 mg twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The final US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosing is 400 mg twice daily.</p><p>For other drugs in which a biomarker of activity is not available or easily accessible, the best way to optimize dosing is not established. Therapeutic drug monitoring has not been widely studied or endorsed, but there is renewed interest in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

No superior dosing scheme has been demonstrated, with the exception of AUC-based dosing for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H390293890\" class=\"local\">'AUC-based dosing'</a> below.) </p><p>In the 1950s, investigators originally proposed normalizing doses of chemotherapeutic agents by using BSA, which had been noted to explain the variation in metabolic rates of animals across a range of species, including humans, and to correlate linearly with blood volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In an early retrospective study conducted in the 1950s, doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mechlorethamine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> per unit of body weight were higher for smaller animals than for larger animals, and for children than in adults, while doses per unit of body surface area were nearly similar for all species and for humans of all ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Subsequently, despite the lack of rigorous validation (and an increasing number of publications that question the validity of BSA-based dosing for a number of conventional cytotoxic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/25-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-35</a>]), BSA-based chemotherapy dosing has become a de facto standard for determining chemotherapy dosing for most cytotoxic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>] and some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>).</p><p>Unfortunately, for many anticancer agents, normalizing doses according to the BSA has only a limited ability to reduce interindividual variability in drug clearance after a single dose of an anticancer agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The correlation coefficients (r values) of the regression curves representing the contribution of BSA to interindividual variation in clearance ranged from 0.17 to 0.44 (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.03 to 0.19). However, the precision for reaching the target AUC was significantly better for BSA dosing compared with fixed dosing for four of the six drugs.</p><p>Many oncologists have a false sense of precision based upon BSA dosing when, in fact, interindividual variation for most drugs (both conventional cytotoxic, as well as novel oral agents) exceeds 30 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96667\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96667 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and the range of clearance among individuals can vary 4- to 10-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>No alternate body-size measures (including lean body mass [LBM], ideal body weight, body mass index [BMI]) have reliably performed better than the BSA in reducing the interindividual variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. One study found that for a variety of therapeutic drugs, LBM was the best size descriptor for clearance of chronically dosed drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The LBM has also been proposed as a potentially superior body size measure for anticancer agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], but a proper scientific rationale for the use of LBM or any other body size measure other than BSA is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/21,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H390293820\"><span class=\"h2\">Algorithms for calculating BSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1916, the first formula (the Du Bois method) for estimating BSA in humans was published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Despite only nine subjects being studied, this formula is relatively accurate for normal weight individuals and is still in use (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-surface-area-in-adults-du-bois-method\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p>Various formulae have subsequently been developed to estimate BSA using height and weight.

The Mosteller formula is the easiest to remember and calculate (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-surface-area-mosteller-square-root-method\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Over the range of typical weights and heights, commonly used BSA formulae do not vary significantly from each other (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96452\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96452 \">figure 3</a>).

Given this fact, and the absence of trial data suggesting superiority of any specific formula, an expert panel convened by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) concluded that any of the formulae is acceptable when calculating doses of anticancer agents according to BSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Notably, individuals with very high body mass index (BMI) have been poorly represented in the cohorts used to generate these formulae. Despite the limited data, the BSA estimates from these formulae seem to differ more substantially in obese (BMI &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and morbidly obese (BMI &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> individuals. In one study that included an obese cohort, all common formulas underestimated BSA for obese individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]For persons &gt;80 kg, the Livingston equation had a 0.83 &plusmn; 0.92 percent error in estimating BSA, whereas the Du Bois equation had a 12.27 &plusmn; 1.23 percent error, and the Gehan equation had a -6.53 &plusmn; 0.99 percent error. Although this study is arguably the only estimator for BSA derived from a cohort of obese individuals, it has not been used to estimate the variance in chemotherapy doses that would result from use of each of the BSA formulas in obese individuals. Although a firm recommendation cannot be made for any of the formulae for calculating a BSA-based dose of anticancer agents in obese patients, the Mosteller formula is the easiest to calculate and remember and provides estimates approximately in the middle of other estimates. It is also the most commonly used formula in practice and in clinical trials.

In keeping with guidelines from the ASCO, we recommend that actual body weight be used for the BSA calculation when dosing cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs based on BSA, especially when the intent of therapy is cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50</a>].

The reasons for this are multifactorial, but one likely contributor to the higher mortality rates described in <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obese</span> patients with cancer is the systematic underdosing of anticancer agents, with a substantial proportion of obese patients receiving reduced doses because of the use of ideal or adjusted ideal body weight or capped doses rather than doses calculated according to actual weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/52-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-57</a>]. As the prevalence of obesity has increased (according to projections from the World Health Organization [WHO], by 2015 more than 700 million adults worldwide will be obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]), awareness of this problem has grown, as reflected in practice guidelines addressing this issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/48,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,59,60</a>].</p><p>Overweight and obese patients often receive chemotherapy doses that are less than recommended because drug doses are based upon a weight that is below their actual body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A nationwide survey of chemotherapy dosing in Australia found that only 6 percent of respondents routinely used actual body weight in BSA calculations for obese patients, with the majority capping the dose or using ideal body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>The adverse impact of such underdosing on cancer outcomes can be illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of the effect of BMI on survival in operable breast cancer found that BMI &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> adversely impacted overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.25, p&lt;0.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Among obese patients, 96 percent had BSA calculated based on ideal weight, resulting in an average 12 percent reduction in chemotherapy dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retrospective analyses of other breast and ovarian cancer clinical trials have also demonstrated inferior clinical outcomes in patients who received arbitrarily reduced chemotherapy doses because of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/62-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-66</a>].</p><p/><p>However, it is not clear that the inferior outcomes associated with obesity can be entirely explained by lower chemotherapy doses. In a study of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) colon cancer trials, obese individuals (BMI &gt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> had a poorer overall survival (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.57) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Dose capping at a BSA of 2.0 m<sup>2</sup> was common, with 55 percent of the obese and 73 percent of the very obese patients having a capped dose compared with 7 percent of normal weight patients. However, dose capping did not explain the association of high BMI with worse outcome.</p><p>One concern is that dosing of obese patients according to actual body weight might lead to excessive toxicity. This issue was addressed in a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies that compared toxicity and efficacy of full weight-based chemotherapy in obese and normal weight cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Hematologic treatment-related toxicity was significantly <strong>less</strong> in obese as compared with normal weight patients (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.98) while nonhematologic toxicity was similar (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.76-1.26). Survival was not adversely affected when obese patients were dosed according to actual body weight.</p><p>Given the mounting data correlating underdosing with inferior outcomes in obese patients, ASCO convened an expert panel to study the appropriate dosing of anticancer agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The expert panel recommended using actual body weight for BSA calculations in obese patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, particularly when the goal of treatment is cure. They recommended that clinicians follow the same recommendations for dose reduction regardless of obesity status for all patients and that consideration be given to resuming full weight-based doses in subsequent cycles, particularly if a possible cause of the toxicity (eg, renal or hepatic insufficiency) is identified. The panel also recommended the use of fixed dosing only with selected cytotoxic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>), and that doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> be capped at 2 mg when used as a part of the CHOP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, vincristine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) and CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) regimens, primarily because of neurotoxicity concerns.

Lean body mass (LBM), when used as a scalar for dosing chemotherapy, is typically not measured but inferred from formulae, which may not be representative of the population of persons with cancer.

Allometric scaling models based upon body size have not generally been successful in predicting clearance of high molecular weight proteins in humans.

However, these standard dosing regimens rarely result in comparable circulating concentrations of the active drug in all patients. It is increasingly apparent that variability in response to newer targeted drugs is influenced not only by genetic heterogeneity of drug targets that determine tumor sensitivity, but also by the pharmacokinetic background of the patient (eg, cytochrome P450 enzymes, oral absorption, and environmental factors that influence pharmacokinetics), as well as adherence to the regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

Furthermore, as chemotherapy regimens are commonly based on combinations of drugs, determination of AUC values for specific drugs would require multiple blood samples to be drawn.

Small variations in the administered dose can lead to severe and life-threatening toxicity in some individuals and underdosing in others, which may compromise cancer outcomes. Proper dose selection is of great importance, particularly in individuals with potentially curable diseases such as lymphoma or testicular carcinoma, and in the setting of adjuvant treatment (eg, breast and colon cancer). However, individuals have a highly variable capacity to metabolize and eliminate drugs, leading to a substantial degree of interindividual variation in drug exposure. (See <a href=\"#H390293784\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an attempt to minimize the amount of interindividual variation in drug exposure in the calculation of effective drug doses, various methods have been developed, primarily based upon body size descriptors. Body surface area (BSA)-based dosing has been widely adopted for most cytotoxic agents and some therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>), despite the lack of rigorous validation and even though its ability to reduce interindividual variation in drug clearance is limited. No superior dosing scheme has been demonstrated, with the exception of area under the curve (AUC)-based dosing for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H355242408\" class=\"local\">'Body surface area (BSA)-based dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Over the range of typical weights and heights, commonly used BSA formulae do not vary from each other significantly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96452\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96452 \">figure 3</a>). Given this fact, and the absence of trial data suggesting superiority of any specific formula, an expert panel convened by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) concluded that any of the formulae is acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H390293820\" class=\"local\">'Algorithms for calculating BSA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are no data to suggest that obese patients dosed based on their actual body weight have increased toxicity, while there are data from retrospective studies that underdosing is associated with inferior outcomes. In keeping with guidelines from ASCO, we recommend that actual body weight be used for the BSA calculation when dosing cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs based on BSA, especially when the intent of therapy is cure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dosing-of-anticancer-agents-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Other recommendations for chemotherapy treatment in obese patients from the ASCO expert panel are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96680 \">table 2</a>).

However, among patients with weight loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sarcopenia, organ function and performance status should be taken into consideration when dosing cytotoxic chemotherapy.

In the absence of data suggesting increased toxicity for underweight or obese individuals receiving weight-based dosing, doses should be based upon actual body weight.

A calculator for ideal body weight is available (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ideal-body-weight-method-of-devine-and-dosing-weight-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 6</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even when doses are normalized according to body size, individuals have a highly variable capacity to metabolize and eliminate drugs, which is due to a combination of physiologic variables, intrinsic (genetic) characteristics, and environmental factors (including drug-drug interactions and food intake). In general, the combined use of classical therapeutic drug monitoring (as a phenotypic approach) and genotyping of drug metabolizing capacity is considered to be the most sophisticated way to individualize the dosage of drugs like anticancer agents, for which the clinical effects are difficult to evaluate. However, the use of preemptive pharmacogenetic testing has not been widely endorsed or adopted, and at present, the only cytotoxic agent for which pharmacokinetic-guided dosing is in widespread use is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitotane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitotane</a>.

However, routine preemptive use of this assay in all patients who are to receive irinotecan is not widely accepted. Whether initial dose reduction improves outcomes for UGT1A1*28 homozygotes and the precise dose reduction that is warranted in this patient population remain controversial areas; in addition, inheritance of UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms seems to account for only a fraction of the observed variability in irinotecan toxicity.
