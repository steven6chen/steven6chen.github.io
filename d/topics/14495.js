Imaging studies (radionuclide bone scan, computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen and pelvis, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are used selectively to assess for extraprostatic extension, regional adenopathy, or distant metastases, depending upon the initial clinical staging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80052\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80052 \">figure 1</a>).
