These veins aren't connected to the correct spot in the heart. Doctors call this condition &quot;TAPVC&quot; for short.</p><p>Normally, blood flows through the heart and lungs in the following way: Blood from the body comes into the right atrium. It flows into the right ventricle and then to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood picks up oxygen. Then the blood goes into the left atrium and into the left ventricle. From there, the heart pumps the blood around the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83996\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83996 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In a TAPVC, blood from the lungs does not return to the left atrium. Instead, it returns to the right atrium. Or the blood returns to another vein in the body and then to the right atrium. As a result, the blood with the oxygen can't easily get to the organs in the body. Plus, sometimes the veins carrying the blood from the lungs get blocked. Both of these things can cause symptoms.</p><p>There are different types of TAPVC, depending on where the veins from the lungs attach. TAPVC is a condition that children are born with. Doctors don't know what causes it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257226493\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a TAPVC?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on the type of TAPVC and whether the veins carrying blood from the lungs are blocked.</p><p>Babies whose condition is severe get very sick within the first 12 hours after birth. Their skin looks blue and they have a lot of trouble breathing.</p><p>Babies whose condition is not as severe usually start having symptoms later on. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing faster than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeding well</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not gaining weight or growing well</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that looks blue</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257226508\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The test most often done to check for a TAPVC is an echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;). This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats. It shows how blood flows through the heart and lungs.</p><p>Sometimes, doctors do other imaging tests. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257226523\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a TAPVC treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A TAPVC is treated with surgery. During surgery, the doctor will fix or move the veins so that blood from the lungs gets to the correct place.</p><p>But before your child has surgery, his or her breathing and general medical condition need to be under control. If your baby's condition is severe, he or she might need one or more of the following before surgery:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra oxygen or other medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A breathing tube &ndash; This is a tube that goes down the throat and into the lungs. The other end is attached to a machine that helps with breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A heart procedure that helps the blood with oxygen get to the left atrium </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To be on a heart and lung machine &ndash; This machine, which doctors call &quot;ECMO,&quot; takes over the jobs of the heart and lungs. It pumps blood from your baby's body, gives it oxygen, and pumps it back into the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257226538\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my child's life be like after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your child's individual situation. All children with TAPVC need to see their heart doctor for regular follow-ups.</p><p>Sometimes after surgery, a problem can happen with one of the veins. If this happens, a child might need surgery again. Also, children sometimes have heart rhythm problems after their surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H257226553\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-appearance-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Newborn appearance (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-septal-defect-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial septal defect (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
