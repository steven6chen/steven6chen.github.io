High-level resistance to vancomycin is encoded by different clusters of genes referred to as the vancomycin-resistance gene clusters (eg, <em>vanA</em>, <em>vanB</em>, and <em>vanD</em> gene clusters).</p><p>The end result is the replacement of D-Ala-D-Ala&ndash;ending peptidoglycan precursors with D-alanyl-D-lactate termini, to which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> binds with significantly lower affinity. The replacement of D-alanine by D-lactate, which disrupts one of the five hydrogen bonds required for the interaction of vancomycin with its target, increases the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of vancomycin almost 1000-fold. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in enterococci&quot;, section on 'Vancomycin resistance'</a>.)</p><p>In the 2006 report from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, the following MIC definitions were used for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> susceptibility and resistance in enterococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> susceptible &ndash; &le;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> resistant &ndash; &ge;32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span></p><p/><p>An MIC of 8 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> was considered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> intermediate, but we do not recommend vancomycin therapy for such isolates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonization and clinical infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were first described in Europe in the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] and soon thereafter in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The presence of VRE in Europe was related to the use of glycopeptides such as avoparcin as a food additive for growth promotion in animals for more than 20 years, a practice that was subsequently banned by the European Union.</p><p>Multiple epidemics of VRE infection have been described in diverse hospital settings (eg, medical and surgical intensive care units, and medical and pediatric wards) and, like methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, VRE is endemic in many large hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>]. In 2008, the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) published summary data on multidrug-resistant organisms suggesting that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> resistance had increased to 33 percent among enterococci that caused healthcare-associated infections in 2006 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In fact, the rate of hospitalization with VRE essentially doubled during 2003 to 2006 from 4.60 to 9.48 hospitalizations per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Modern techniques have expanded our knowledge of the epidemiology of VRE. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been utilized in analyses of both epidemic and endemic clusters of VRE infection and colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/3,5,8,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,8,15,16</a>]. These studies demonstrated that a single VRE clone can spread within an institution or a patient care unit. In addition, VRE strains can transfer resistance horizontally to unrelated strains. Both methods of spread can occur simultaneously in a single institution. One report using PFGE found 45 different profiles in a single medical center where VRE had become endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The vast majority of VRE isolates are <em>Enterococcus faecium</em>. This was illustrated in a prospective analysis from the Surveillance and Control or Pathogens of Epidemiologic Importance (SCOPE) database of 24,179 nosocomial bloodstream infections occurring in 49 hospitals in the United States between 1995 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> resistance was found in 60 percent of <em>E. faecium</em> isolates compared with 2 percent of <em>E. faecalis</em> isolates. Data from the NHSN suggest that resistance trends are worsening; 80 percent of the 987 isolates of <em>E. faecium</em> and 6.9 percent of the 1497 isolates of <em>E. faecalis</em> reported in 2006 and 2007 were vancomycin resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>VRE infections have been associated with adverse outcomes. The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a meta-analysis of nine studies of 1614 enterococcal bloodstream infections, 42 percent of which were due to VRE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with VRE compared with vancomycin-susceptible enterococcal isolates (summary odds ratio 2.5, 95% CI 1.9-3.4).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have been introduced into a healthcare setting, transmission is determined by selective pressure due to antimicrobial use, the proportion of colonized patients, the availability of susceptible patients, and adherence to prevention efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The risk increases significantly in an intensive care unit once the proportion of patients exceeds 50 percent.</p><p>VRE colonize the gastrointestinal tract and can be found on the skin due to fecal shedding. Colonization with VRE generally precedes infection, but not all patients with colonization become infected. Persons either colonized or infected with VRE can serve as sources for secondary transmission.</p><p>VRE colonization is identified through the use of rectal or perirectal swab cultures or stool cultures. The overall sensitivity of rectal swab cultures for detection of VRE was 58 percent in one report but varied directly with VRE density in stool from 100 percent at high densities (&ge;7.5 logs per gram) to 0 percent at low densities (&le;4.5 logs per gram) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Both prior antibiotic exposure and skin colonization with VRE were more common in patients with high stool densities. The authors speculated that the high false-negative rate of rectal swab cultures may contribute to the increasing prevalence of VRE.</p><p>Polymerase chain reaction techniques for identification of <em>vanA</em> and <em>vanB</em> genes from <span class=\"nowrap\">stool/rectal</span> samples have been developed, but their impact on surveillance for VRE has yet to be determined.</p><p>Transmission can occur by both direct contact (eg, the hands of healthcare workers) and indirectly from environmental surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The following observations come from different studies that have evaluated VRE transmission:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study in which VRE were inoculated in different places, the strains survived for five to seven days on countertops, 24 hours without a reduction in counts on bedrails, 60 minutes on a telephone handpiece, and 30 minutes on the diaphragmatic surface of stethoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal electronic thermometer probes were the means of transmission of VRE in an intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental cultures for VRE were more likely to be positive when the stool density of the organism exceeded four logs per gram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthcare workers can become colonized in their gastrointestinal tracts, but the rate of acquisition of stool colonization appears to be low and transmission to patients from this source has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of risk factors for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonization and infection.

As an example, a prospective study of 126 adult intensive care units (ICUs) in 60 hospitals found that vancomycin and cephalosporin use were significantly higher in patients with VRE, after controlling for the type of ICU and rates of VRE elsewhere in the institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In another report, colonization or infection was associated with a longer duration of therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> (13.2 versus 4.6 days in noninfected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]).</p><p>Use of multiple agents with a broad spectrum of activity may predispose patients to colonization with resistant enterococci, probably via alteration of the normal bowel flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, among patients with VRE in stool, the administration of antibiotics active against anaerobic organisms can increase the density of stool colonization with VRE, which decreases after discontinuation of these agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of patient characteristics other than antimicrobial therapy have been associated with a high risk of VRE colonization. These include hospitalization longer than 72 hours, significant underlying medical conditions (end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, cancer, transplant recipient), requirement for ICU, and invasive devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Colonization pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonization pressure is an important risk factor for acquisition of VRE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/19,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,27</a>]. Colonization pressure in hospitals can lead to substantial increases in VRE colonization. A review of 1039 patients admitted to a general medicine ward demonstrated that colonization with VRE increased from 3.8 percent on admission to 32 percent during hospitalization; 60 percent of the VRE isolates were the same strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Indeed, hospitalization is strongly correlated with risk of VRE colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Colonization pressure may outweigh other risk factors including antibiotic use once 50 percent or more of patients within the unit are colonized with VRE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Exposure to contaminated surfaces</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to contaminated surfaces in patient rooms, even after routine discharge cleaning, may be associated with VRE acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. For example, several outbreaks caused by transmission of VRE from contaminated medical equipment have been reported. Implicated medical equipment included rectal thermometers, tympanic thermometers, and contaminated electrocardiogram leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/22,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32,33</a>].</p><p>Transmission of VRE from environmental surfaces to the hands or gloves of healthcare workers has been well documented. Forty-six percent of healthcare workers who touched bedrails and bedside tables in rooms of colonized patients in turn contaminated their gloves with VRE in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Another study demonstrated that gloves or hands contaminated through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces can transfer VRE to approximately 10 percent of uncontaminated surfaces that are subsequently touched by other healthcare workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

A prospective quasi-experimental study showed that improved environmental cleaning significantly reduced the rate of VRE acquisition in a medical ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This study was divided into four phases: a baseline period, a period including education to improve cleaning practices, a &quot;washout&quot; period, and a period including a multimodal hand hygiene initiative. Patients were screened for VRE on admission to ICU and daily thereafter. Enhanced cleaning with a detergent-disinfectant was found to reduce environmental and hand contamination as well as VRE acquisition. Novel technologies such as steam vapor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], UV-C irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], vaporized hydrogen peroxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and copper-lined surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] may further decrease environmental contamination and transmission of VRE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Residence in long-term care facilities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) appear to be a reservoir for VRE. In a prospective cohort study, 45 percent of patients admitted to an acute care hospital from an LTCF had rectal colonization with VRE; risk factors included prior use of antibiotics and the presence of a decubitus ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTION CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention of infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), as with any multidrug-resistant organism, requires a multifaceted approach including general infection prevention (eg, optimal management of vascular and urinary catheters), accurate and prompt diagnosis and treatment, prudent use of antimicrobial drugs, and prevention of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Methods for prevention will be summarized here.</p><p>Several different strategies for the prevention, control, and eradication of VRE have been studied.

Antimicrobial soaps (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> containing) may be more useful than plain soap for patients with VRE in contact precautions or during an epidemic.

In general, during the first year following VRE infection, we favor documentation of three negative weekly stool or rectal swabs to discontinue contact precautions; if more than one year has passed since VRE infection, we favor one negative stool or rectal swab.</p><p>Guidelines regarding the duration of contact precautions for acute care settings were published in 2018 by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. For patients previously infected or colonized with VRE, these guidelines recommend discontinuation of contact precautions after documentation of one to three negative weekly stool or rectal swab surveillance cultures and state that that extension of contact precautions is reasonable for patients who are highly immunosuppressed, being treated with broad antibiotic therapy without VRE activity, or receiving care in protected environments (such as burn units) or in institutions with high VRE rates.</p><p>VRE colonization may be prolonged, with high relapse rates after multiple consecutive negative surveillance cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vancomycin-resistant-enterococci-epidemiology-prevention-and-control/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].
