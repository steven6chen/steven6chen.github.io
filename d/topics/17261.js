National Center for Health Statistics cites 492,000 tibial fractures per year in the United States. Open fractures generally occur from high velocity trauma (eg, automobile collision). Closed injuries may occur from falls or sports-related trauma.</p><p>This topic will review issues related to tibial shaft fractures. Tibial shaft fractures in children and a general overview of tibial fractures in adults are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tibial-and-fibular-shaft-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tibial and fibular shaft fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Greater than 70,000 hospitalizations, 800,000 office visits, and 500,000 hospital days have been attributed to tibial shaft fractures in the United States annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The presence of significant osteoporosis increases the risk for compound or more complex fractures associated with higher morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. More severe tibia fractures stem from high-energy trauma, most often motor vehicle collisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. In Europe, closed tibial fractures are often associated with football (soccer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Shin guards may provide some protection, but many players who sustain tibial fractures are using shin guards at the time of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Skiing is another sport commonly associated with low-energy, often torsional, tibia fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tibia is the major weight-bearing bone of the lower leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54800 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a>). The proximal portion of the bone, the tibial plateau, forms the lower surface of the knee joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69611 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70435\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70435 \">picture 3</a>). The tibial shaft bridges the distance to the distal tibia which contributes the superior articular surface of the ankle joint at the tibiotalar articulation as well as the medial malleolus. Another key bony landmark is the tibial tuberosity which sits several centimeters below the joint line and the inferior patellar pole and serves as the attachment site for the patellar tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A strong fibrous structure, the interosseous membrane, or syndesmosis, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77999\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77999 \">figure 2</a>) connects the tibia and fibula along the length of the two bones. Proximally, this structure, reinforced by strong anterior and posterior ligaments, forms a synovial joint, the proximal tibiofibular articulation. Distally, the interosseous membrane and three ligaments, the anterior, posterior, and transverse tibiofibular ligaments stabilize the superior ankle joint.</p><p>Another fibrous structure, the crural fascia surrounds the bones and muscles of the lower leg. Fascial extensions and the interosseous membrane separate the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the lower leg into four distinct compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66579 \">figure 3</a>). Three of these, the anterior, posterior, and deep posterior compartments, all border the tibia and can be compromised by tibial injury.</p><p>Nerves and vessels lie within the anterior and the deep posterior compartments, and trauma that causes significant swelling in these compartments can result in neurovascular compromise. The key blood supply of the tibia arises from periosteal vessels and the nutrient artery. The nutrient artery originates from the posterior tibial artery and enters the posterolateral cortex at the middle third of the tibial shaft near the origin of the soleus muscle. Fractures in this region potentially compromise this blood supply.</p><p>The periosteal vessels provide a less vulnerable circulation as they derive an abundant blood supply from the anterior tibial artery, which travels down along the interosseous membrane. Vascular compromise can arise proximally, from marked effusion of the knee joint or trauma that affects the popliteal artery before it branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries or at the level of the anterior tibial artery as it branches off the popliteal artery and passes through a gap in the interosseous membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The tibial nerve and several branches provide the key innervation to the muscles of the lower leg and foot. Nerve roots arise from L4 through S3. The posterior tibial nerve parallels the course of the posterior tibial artery and courses through the deep posterior compartment. In the popliteal space, branches of the tibial nerve provide innervation to the posterior compartment and to the popliteus muscle. The deep peroneal nerve branches and follows the course of the anterior tibial artery providing innervation to muscles in the anterior lower leg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three types of forces lead to most tibial shaft fractures: low-energy, high-energy, and rotational. Low-energy forces, such as those involved in sporting injuries or falls from standing, generally lead to fracture in the distal tibial shaft. Fractures of the thicker proximal shaft typically arise from high-energy impact, as occurs with motor vehicle collisions. Tibial fractures from high-energy trauma are associated with higher complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Rotational forces lead to oblique, spiral, or distal fractures.</p><p>Direct trauma leads to transverse and comminuted fractures with the extent of comminution roughly proportional to the magnitude of force. Fractures from direct blows typically affect the anterior medial tibia, in part because of the lack of soft tissue protection.</p><p>Classifications of tibial fractures based upon specific aspects of the bone injury or by the degree of associated soft tissue injury are used to guide orthopedic decision-making and help to predict outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The classification schemes for tibial shaft fractures used by orthopedists are beyond the scope of this discussion but were discussed in a 2003 review of treatment of closed tibial fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], to which the interested reader is referred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tibial shaft fractures result in localized swelling, pain, and the inability to bear weight. Significantly displaced fractures can lead to a shift in the alignment of the lower leg. Open fractures are common and overlying skin should be carefully examined for small lacerations.</p><p>Severe fractures from high velocity trauma can be associated with neurovascular injury. Therefore, it is important to examine distal pulses and lower extremity motor and sensory function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Displaced tibial shaft fractures and those with considerable soft tissue trauma are at increased risk for developing acute compartment syndrome (ACS), a limb-threatening complication. Symptoms and signs of ACS can include increasing and unrelenting pain, tense swelling, and pain with passive flexion and extension of the toes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain film radiographs to assess tibial shaft fracture include anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. Plain radiographs are generally thought to be highly sensitive and specific for typical tibial shaft fractures, but high quality studies supporting this assertion are lacking. Plain radiographs are less sensitive for detecting subtle metaphyseal fractures, stress fractures, and insufficiency fractures. </p><p>The AP and lateral radiographs obtained should include the entire length of the lower leg from knee to ankle. Radiolucent splinting prevents additional injury and allows proper positioning to best visualize fractures. </p><p>As noted above, the orthopedic literature describes numerous fracture classification systems and radiographic grading criteria that are beyond the scope of this discussion. However, radiographic findings that are important for initial evaluation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomical location of the fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of separation or overlap of fracture fragments in order to distinguish displaced from nondisplaced fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fracture pattern (eg, transverse, oblique, comminuted)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degree of angulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of malrotation</p><p/><p>These radiographic features help to determine whether conservative or operative treatment is preferred (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85950 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F85951\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef85951 \">image 1</a>). Significant malrotation, malalignment (angulation), and displacement for tibial shaft fractures are defined as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malrotated fractures have &ge;10 degrees of rotation in any plane</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malaligned fractures are angulated &ge;10 degrees</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displaced fractures have &ge;5 mm of displacement</p><p/><p>Research into the use of ultrasound to diagnose long bone fractures is ongoing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in adults&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H500560726\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Definitive diagnosis of a tibial shaft fracture is made by plain radiograph.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H500560733\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation and diagnosis of tibia fractures resulting from high-energy trauma is straightforward. However, the presentation of tibia fractures caused by low-energy trauma may be similar to a number of other conditions. In the large majority of cases, a history of trauma combined with clinical findings of significant pain, focal tenderness, and an inability to ambulate will prompt the clinician to obtain plain radiograph and diagnose the tibia fracture. However, similarities in the initial presentation may cause confusion in some instances. Conditions to consider in the setting of low-energy trauma include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medial tibial stress syndrome</strong> <strong>(&ldquo;shin splints&rdquo;)</strong> &#8210; Medial Tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is relatively common among runners, who present with a gradual increase in pain that is present diffusely most often along the posterior medial border of the tibia extending from the middle to the distal third of the shaft. Typically, there is no history of acute trauma, no focal tenderness, and no difficulty with simple ambulation. The key distinguishing feature beyond history and examination is the absence of any radiographic abnormality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity#H24287212\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) and tibial stress fractures'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tibial stress fracture</strong> &#8210; Patients with a stress fracture of the tibial shaft develop pain gradually over several weeks that occurs only during activity (eg, running), but a sudden increase in pain may prompt them to seek medical attention. Typically, there is no history of acute trauma, and while there may be some pain there is no difficulty with simple ambulation. Radiographs are often unremarkable but may reveal a stress fracture. When positive, the radiograph findings of a stress fracture are more subtle and often focal, which help to distinguish them from a traumatic fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-tibia-and-fibula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the tibia and fibula&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insufficiency fracture due to osteoporosis or other bone disease</strong> &#8210; Insufficiency fractures can occur without trauma but manifest similar clinical findings (eg, focal tenderness, inability to ambulate) and are diagnosed by plain radiograph. Management is likely to be more complex than similar fractures in the absence of underlying bone disease. A key radiographic feature suggesting insufficiency fracture is relative osteopenia along the entire tibia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microtrabecular fracture</strong> <strong>(&ldquo;bone bruise&rdquo;)</strong> &#8210; Microtrabecular fractures, or bone bruises, frequently occur in conjunction with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries but also with posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), meniscus, and other intra-articular injury. These fractures typically occur on the femoral condyles or on the medial or lateral tibial plateaus. Rarely, these lesions, which are seen only with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), develop on the tibial shaft and cause symptoms classically associated with a tibial fracture, including pain and inability to bear weight. If such lesions are found in the shaft of the tibia, clinicians should assess the patient for metabolic bone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The absence of cortical change on radiograph or MRI, combined with the presence of bone marrow edema on MRI, is diagnostic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subperiosteal hematoma</strong> &#8210; Blunt trauma, particularly along the course of the anterior tibial artery, can lead to a significant hematoma with enough pain to mimic fracture. Pseudo-aneurysm of the tibial artery occurs in rare situations of blunt trauma and may caused delayed pain and swelling. While all contact sports pose a risk, snowboarding and alpine sports are performed at high velocity and contusions to the tibia and lower extremity are among the commonest injuries sustained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Soft tissue swelling, pain, and tightness may suggest fracture, but radiographs are unremarkable. Musculoskeletal ultrasound can confirm the presence of hematoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone tumor</strong> &#8210; Tumors in long bones generally become symptomatic over months. However, pain frequently begins after an injury, may wax and wane, and persists at night in some cases. Systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and malaise are often absent. Examination often reveals focal tenderness and a soft tissue mass. The proximal tibial shaft is a relatively common site for osteosarcoma. Some tumors present as pathologic fractures following trauma. Diagnosis is made by radiograph. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteosarcoma-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteosarcoma: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-bone-tumors-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign bone tumors in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute compartment syndrome</strong> &#8210; Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) most often develops soon after significant trauma, particularly involving long bone fractures, but nontraumatic conditions may play a role. Important clues to the development of ACS include rapid progression of symptoms and signs over a few hours and the presence of multiple findings consistent with the diagnosis in a patient at risk. Notable findings include pain out of proportion to apparent injury, pain with passive stretch of muscles in the affected compartment, and a tense compartment with a firm &quot;wood-like&quot; feeling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ORTHOPEDIC REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many physicians refer traumatic tibial fractures to orthopedists for definitive care. Rare exceptions to this would be minor, non-displaced fractures. Physicians managing such fractures must be proficient in the application and management of long-leg casts.</p><p>Emergent surgical referral is required for open (compound) fractures, fractures with evidence of neurovascular injury or compartment syndrome, and fractures associated with dislocation of the knee or ankle (which must be reduced immediately). Time to operative intervention correlates with the risk of infection in open tibial fractures: a delay greater than six hours increases the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Urgent referral, within a day or two of injury, is needed for severely comminuted fractures and markedly displaced fractures (assuming there is no neurovascular compromise). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-tibiofemoral-dislocation-and-reduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee (tibiofemoral) dislocation and reduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Orthopedists do not agree on how much displacement is acceptable or when to proceed with intramedullary nailing. Early assessment by the orthopedist helps to determine the treatment strategy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment is focused on symptomatic relief and preventing further injury. Stabilization of the fracture is accomplished with a long leg posterior splint. Ice, elevation, and light compression minimize swelling and, along with analgesics, help to control pain (issues surrounding the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with fractures are reviewed separately). These treatments continue for 48 to 72 hours, or until definitive management begins. Close monitoring during the initial treatment phase must allow clinicians or caretakers to detect any emerging compartment syndrome or change in neurovascular status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Possible effect on fracture healing'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to adequate protein and calcium intake, vitamin D supplementation is a reasonable intervention to help ensure proper fracture healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Research demonstrates that vitamin D levels fall during the early weeks of tibial fracture healing. As vitamin D plays a role in the mineralization and formation of callus, many physicians prefer to supplement vitamin D during the healing phase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-definitive-fracture-management#H64687106\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of definitive fracture management&quot;, section on 'Adjunctive therapy for fracture healing'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIVE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Closed, well-aligned, nondisplaced tibial shaft fractures may be definitively treated with a long leg cast. Optimal management of displaced tibial shaft fractures has not been definitively determined, but intramedullary nailing is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Long leg casting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to effectively protect the tibia following fracture, a long-leg cast is applied that incorporates the knee and ankle joint, thus preventing excess motion above and below the fracture. The cast extends from the metatarsal heads to the upper thigh. The ankle is positioned in neutral with no dorsal or plantar flexion. Knee position allows up to 5 degrees of flexion. The steps for applying this type of cast are described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lay out all the necessary equipment, including appropriately sized stockinette and casting material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108900\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108900 \">picture 4</a>). It is important to position the leg properly with the preferred angles for knee and ankle flexion and maintain these while the under layers and casting material are applied. Assistance is necessary. The first layer applied is the stockinette (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108901\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108901 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Next, apply the padding for the cast (eg, Webril) by rolling it onto the extremity from distal to proximal; each layer should overlap the preceding layer by about 50 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108903\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108903 \">picture 6</a>). Three or four layers of padding are used for the lower extremity. Add extra padding over any bony prominences (eg, medial and lateral malleoli), and avoid any folding of the padding material to prevent pressure sores from developing below the cast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the padding is in place, apply the cast material, either fiberglass cast tape or plaster (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108904\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108904 \">picture 7</a>). The cast material is applied to the lower leg first, moving distal to proximal and ensuring approximately a 50 percent overlap with the previous layer. Before the final layer is applied, fold the distal end of the stockinette back over the cast material and then add the final layer. Folding back the stockinette prevents the cast tape or plaster from touching the patient&rsquo;s skin. A total of 5 to 6 layers of fiberglass tape, or 8 to 12 layers of plaster, is applied. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the casting material applied to the lower leg has set (usually 5 to 10 minutes), apply casting material to the thigh (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108905 \">picture 8</a>). Again, a 50 percent overlap of layers is appropriate, and before the final layer is applied, the stockinette should be folded back over the cast material at the proximal thigh and the final layer of casting material applied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F108906\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108906 \">picture 9</a>). Once the casting material is applied, but before it sets, the clinician can use the flat surface of their palms to mold the cast to the contours of the bones.</p><p/><p>This type of cast permits limited weight bearing to begin when clinically feasible. Plaster casts mold more closely to the leg and are preferred for the first few weeks of treatment. At the first cast change a switch to fiberglass material allows the patient a much lighter cast and easier ambulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-definitive-fracture-management#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of definitive fracture management&quot;, section on 'Casting'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Operative interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If long leg casting fails to achieve or maintain adequate reduction of tibial shaft fractures, the patient needs operative intervention.</p><p>It remains uncertain whether operative interventions, such as intramedullary nailing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50245\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50245 \">image 2</a>) or external fixation, result in better outcomes than closed management with casting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. A meta-analysis of studies that compared cast treatment to open reduction and internal fixation or intramedullary nailing of closed tibial shaft fractures found insufficient evidence to support the superiority of any approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another review that pooled data from prospective studies of cast versus operative treatment in 895 fractures was also inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Several trials involving cast braces have reported satisfactory outcomes supporting the notion that conservative care is adequate for many tibial shaft fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. </p><p>An observational study, performed in a developing country, of 68 patients with tibial fractures treated alternately with cast bracing or intramedullary nailing reported no major differences in functional outcomes but lower treatment costs in the cast bracing group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While commercial products made from synthetic materials are available, the traditional cast brace is made by covering the entire leg and foot with stockinette and then applying two plaster casts, one to the lower leg and one to the thigh (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97678\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97678 \">picture 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97679\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97679 \">picture 11</a>). These two casts are connected on the medial and lateral aspects of the knee by attaching two hinged medal braces to each plaster cast segment. This construct provides for some degree of knee flexion when patients begin progressive weight bearing (generally not for several weeks, depending upon the injury). Thus, cast bracing may offer advantages in areas with limited resources and less access to surgical services. </p><p>The following observations may be pertinent to decision-making regarding management in an individual patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative treatment leads to lower rates of non-union or malunion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cast treatment entails a lower risk of superficial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p>However, if long leg casting fails to achieve or maintain adequate reduction of tibial shaft fractures, the patient needs operative intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loosening of the cast typically occurs as swelling decreases. Thus, the cast is likely to need changing every two to three weeks. Plaster casts mold more closely to the leg and are preferred for the first two to three weeks of treatment. Subsequently, a switch to lighter fiberglass material allows for easier ambulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The patient should remain non-weight bearing for the first one to two weeks in the long leg cast, and then progress gradually to partial and then full weight bearing. Serial radiographs are obtained at weekly follow-up visits to identify any loss of reduction or change in position. After approximately four weeks, visits are extended to every two weeks and these continue until evidence of satisfactory bone healing occurs, as demonstrated by callus formation and filling in of the fracture line on radiograph. Radiographic union scales are being developed to help clinicians determine the adequacy of healing, but further study is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The author obtains radiographs at each follow-up visit until healing is evident. Thereafter, radiographs are obtained only if there is new trauma or new or unusual pain develops at the site. </p><p>Most nondisplaced tibial shaft fractures heal within 10 to 14 weeks. Definitive treatment entails four to six weeks of immobilization in a long leg cast. The cast is exchanged for a short leg walking brace (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86895 \">picture 12</a>) when satisfactory bone healing is documented. Newer, lightweight walking appliances with air or other cushioned padding allow more aggressive rehabilitation once the patient progresses enough to use them.</p><p>Although prolonged absences from sedentary work are unnecessary, many patients with tibial shaft fractures experience persistent pain and have difficulty returning to full activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Clinicians should caution patients that healing takes time and that some symptoms may persist. (See <a href=\"#H2147279\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2147279\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the days following injury, patients with tibial shaft fractures are at relatively high risk of developing acute compartment syndrome (ACS), a limb-threatening complication. Patients must be monitored closely for signs of ACS during this period. Early symptoms of ACS include progressive pain out of proportion to the injury; signs include tense swollen compartments and pain with passive stretching of muscles within the affected compartment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.) </p><p>Other potential short-term complications include infection, which occurs more frequently with open fractures and those requiring surgical fixation, and loss of alignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Possible longer-term complications include malunion and nonunion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fat embolism syndrome occurs following high energy trauma, particularly fractures to long bones or the pelvis. The condition can be life-threatening. Common manifestations include signs of respiratory distress, including hypoxemia, dyspnea, and tachypnea, followed by neurologic abnormalities, frequently involving confusion and depressed mental status. The condition can occur before or following surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fat-embolism-syndrome#H5337817\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fat embolism syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Observational studies suggest that patients treated with intramedullary nailing regain function but often experience chronic sequelae, including knee pain, leg swelling, reduced ankle mobility, thigh and calf muscle atrophy, and osteoarthritis of the knee or ankle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The percent of patients experiencing pain at 3 to 12 months following surgery ranges from approximately 40 to 65 percent, and pain may persist much longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. Although most patients experience mild to moderate pain (in one small observational study, approximately 90 percent rated their pain as 1 to 5 on a 10-point visual analog scale), a substantial percentage experience more severe pain. Many patients also experience some degree of hyperalgesia. </p><p>Injury to the peroneal nerve occurs more often with fractures managed surgically, but the resulting deficit is usually sensory and temporary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Athletes recovering from tibial shaft fractures should be aware that calf atrophy can persist for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>A small number of patients with tibia fractures sustained from high-energy trauma also incur proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation, which may manifest as instability during recovery after surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This uncommon problem may be overlooked, but should be investigated in patients who experience feelings of instability in the area of the proximal tibiofibular joint during their recovery. </p><p>Cigarette smoking increases the risk of nonunion and malunion with all fracture types, but multiple observational studies report an association between smoking and impaired healing of tibial fractures in particular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether a patient can return to full activity depends upon the severity of the tibial fracture and concomitant injuries, the activity, and patient characteristics (eg, age, comorbidities). In general, if patients' occupations require minimal walking or standing, they can often return to work once they progress out of a long leg cast. For most athletes, cross-training in non-weight bearing activities begins at approximately four to six weeks following the injury.</p><p>Retrospective studies have examined the recovery time for tibial shaft fractures in soccer athletes. The following observations are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 50 consecutive adult soccer athletes with tibial shaft fractures, all reported good or excellent outcomes with treatment but only 54 percent returned to competitive soccer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review of 31 athletes with lower leg fractures found a significant delay in return to sport. For tibial fractures the return time averaged 35 weeks but if both tibia and fibula were fractured the athletes needed 40 weeks.</p><p/><p>Even though athletes rate outcomes highly, the severity of a tibial fracture indicates that they face a protracted recovery time before highly competitive activities can resume. A systematic review that included 16 studies but only three randomized trials reported greater delays and a lower rate of return to sport in those treated nonsurgically: 92 percent of athletes treated surgically returned to full sport compared to only 67 percent in the nonsurgical cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Retrospective data on United States professional football players with a tibial shaft fracture showed that better than 90 percent returned to sport following intramedullary nailing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. While their performance remained impaired during the first year following injury, players returned to their baseline during the second year of recovery. </p><p>Prevention of tibial fractures in athletes is a worthy goal. However, a simple measure, shin guards, shows little effect on these injuries as 90 percent of soccer players experienced the injury while wearing them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Although operative and non-operative care leads to complete healing in the vast majority of tibial shaft fractures, residual symptoms are common. In a study of patients treated with intramedullary nailing or plate fixation, 61 of 64 (95 percent) returned to work, but 20 (31 percent) had to modify their work duties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Residual ankle pain developed in 30 to 40 percent of patients, while knee pain developed in 20 to 30 percent.</p><p>For many patients who undergo surgery to treat a tibial shaft fracture, the injury has life-long consequences. In a retrospective series of 223 patients with a mean follow up of 7.9 years, 60 percent reported limitations in their activity and 44 percent reported chronic knee pain, leading to a drop in quality of life scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Particularly worrisome is that younger patients (18 to 34 years) reported the most difficulties. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Low-energy injuries more often lead to distal tibial fractures, while rotational injuries (foot planted and leg twists) cause spiral, oblique, or distal fractures. Diagnosis is made by plain radiograph. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presentation of tibia fractures caused by low-energy trauma may be similar to a number of other conditions. These are described in the text. In most such cases, radiographs allow the clinician to distinguish a fracture from alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H500560733\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most physicians refer traumatic tibial shaft fractures to an orthopedist for definitive management. Fractures with comminution, significant angulation, or significant displacement must be referred. Significant malrotation, malalignment (angulation), and displacement for tibial shaft fractures are defined as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Malrotated fractures have &ge;10 degrees of rotation in any plane</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Malaligned fractures are angulated &ge;10 degrees</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Displaced fractures have &ge;5 mm of displacement (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic referral'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergent surgical referral is required for all open fractures, fractures associated with neurovascular injury or suspected acute compartment syndrome, and fractures associated with dislocation of the knee or ankle. Tibial shaft fractures carry a relatively high risk for acute compartment syndrome (ACS), a potentially limb-threatening complication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management includes use of a posterior long leg splint, analgesia, light compression, analgesics, and non-weight bearing status with crutches. Supplementation with vitamin D is a reasonable intervention. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minor, nondisplaced, well-aligned tibial shaft fractures may be managed conservatively by physicians who are skilled at the application of a long leg cast and with monitoring for complications, such as neurovascular injury and acute compartment syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Definitive treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial splint is exchanged for a long leg cast after 48 to 72 hours once acute swelling has subsided. A plaster cast is preferred at the initial exchange. The plaster cast may be exchanged for a lighter weight fiberglass cast after two to three weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If radiographic healing is progressing normally six weeks following the initial injury, the long leg cast is exchanged for a short leg walking cast, or a commercial cushioned lower leg walking splint. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of nonunion, malunion, and delayed fracture healing. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2147279\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term follow up of tibial shaft fractures suggests that many patients experience some limitation of activity and often develop knee or ankle pain.
