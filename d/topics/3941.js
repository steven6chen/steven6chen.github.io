Once the presence of prolactin excess is identified, further evaluation to establish the underlying cause is usually straightforward. The clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia are reviewed here. The causes and treatment of hyperprolactinemia are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperprolactinemia causes typical symptoms in premenopausal women and in men but not in postmenopausal women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Premenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperprolactinemia in premenopausal women causes hypogonadism, with symptoms that include infertility, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] and less often galactorrhea. In a retrospective study of 104 patients with hyperprolactinemia ages 30 to 44 years, the most commonly reported symptoms were infertility, headache, and oligomenorrhea in 48, 39, and 29 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Galactorrhea was slightly less common (24 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Menstrual cycle dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excluding pregnancy, hyperprolactinemia accounts for approximately 10 to 20 percent of cases of amenorrhea. The mechanism appears to involve inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH), and perhaps follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion, via inhibition of the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). As a result, serum gonadotropin concentrations are normal or low, as in other causes of secondary hypogonadism.</p><p>The symptoms of hypogonadism due to hyperprolactinemia in premenopausal women correlate with the magnitude of the hyperprolactinemia. In most laboratories, a serum prolactin concentration above 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units) is considered abnormally high in women of reproductive age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serum prolactin concentration greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units) is typically associated with overt hypogonadism, subnormal estradiol secretion and its consequences, including amenorrhea, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate degrees of hyperprolactinemia, eg, serum prolactin values of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units), cause either amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild degrees of hyperprolactinemia, eg, serum prolactin values of 20 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (20 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units), may cause only insufficient progesterone secretion and, therefore, a short luteal phase of the menstrual cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Mild hyperprolactinemia can cause infertility even when there is no abnormality of the menstrual cycle; these women account for approximately 20 percent of those evaluated for infertility.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438374791\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone density</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with amenorrhea secondary to hyperprolactinemia have a lower spine and forearm bone mineral density compared with normal women or women with hyperprolactinemia and normal menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Restoration of menses following therapy results in an increase in bone density, although it may not return to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Adolescents, when compared with adults with prolactinomas, have lower bone density at the time of diagnosis and less improvement after two years of dopamine agonist therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Galactorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperprolactinemia in premenopausal women can also cause galactorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], but most premenopausal women who have hyperprolactinemia do not have galactorrhea (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Premenopausal women'</a> above). Many women who have galactorrhea have normal serum prolactin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Galactorrhea without hyperprolactinemia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nipple-discharge\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nipple discharge&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Postmenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postmenopausal women, by definition, are already hypogonadal, and hyperprolactinemia does not change that situation. Because postmenopausal women are also markedly hypoestrogenemic, galactorrhea is rare. Hyperprolactinemia in these women is recognized only in the relatively unusual situation when a lactotroph adenoma becomes so large as to cause headaches or impair vision or is detected as an incidental finding when a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed for an unrelated reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperprolactinemia also causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men, which is manifested by decreased libido, impotence, infertility, gynecomastia, or rarely, galactorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As in women, there is a rough correlation between the presence of any of these symptoms and the degree of hyperprolactinemia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism &ndash; Hyperprolactinemia causes decreased testosterone secretion and low serum testosterone concentrations that are not associated with an increase in LH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As in women, the effect of prolactin must be on the pituitary or hypothalamus. The consequences of the hypogonadism are similar to those of hypogonadism due to other causes and include, in the short term, decreased energy and libido, and in the long term, decreased muscle mass and body hair, and osteoporosis. In one study of 20 men, for example, 16 had osteopenia in the spine and six in the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males&quot;, section on 'Hyperprolactinemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erectile dysfunction &ndash; Hyperprolactinemia appears to cause erectile dysfunction by a mechanism unrelated to hypogonadism because correcting the hyperprolactinemia with a dopamine agonist drug corrects the impotence. One report suggests that correcting the hypogonadism by the administration of testosterone does not correct the impotence, which corresponds to the author's anecdotal observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction#H2096023\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of male sexual dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Endocrine disorders'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infertility &ndash; Although hyperprolactinemia can cause infertility in men, probably by decreasing LH and perhaps FSH secretion, it is not a common finding among men who present for evaluation of infertility. In a study of 171 infertile men, as an example, only seven (4 percent) had hyperprolactinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-male-infertility#H1073539431\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of male infertility&quot;, section on 'Endocrine and systemic disorders (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Galactorrhea &ndash; Men with hyperprolactinemia may develop galactorrhea. This occurs less often than in women, presumably because the glandular breast tissue in men has not been made sensitive to prolactin by preceding stimulation by estrogen and progesterone.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125670483\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made by a serum prolactin concentration that is well above the normal range (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L])</span>. If an initial serum prolactin concentration is only slightly elevated (21 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [21 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units]), the test should be repeated before the patient is considered to have hyperprolactinemia. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Hyperprolactinemia is a potential cause of oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility in women, and hypogonadism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erectile dysfunction in men. Therefore, serum prolactin should be measured in a patient who presents with any of these symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125670444\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum prolactin concentrations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual normal range for serum prolactin is approximately 5 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (5 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span>. The measurement can be performed at any time since usual daily activities have little effect on prolactin secretion. However, serum prolactin concentrations may increase slightly during sleep, strenuous exercise, and occasionally with emotional or physical stress, intense breast stimulation, and high-protein meals. Therefore, if an initial prolactin level is only borderline high, the test should be repeated (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia'</a> below). Normal values are higher in women than men, and dynamic testing is not needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529482178\"><span class=\"h2\">Pitfalls in diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529482184\"><span class=\"h3\">Hook effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caution should be exercised in interpreting serum prolactin concentrations between 20 and 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units) in the presence of a macroadenoma because of possible artifactually low values due to the &quot;hook effect&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. This effect occurs when a very high serum prolactin, eg, 5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units), saturates both the capture and signal antibodies used in immunoradiometric and chemiluminescent assays, preventing the binding of the two in a &quot;sandwich.&quot; The result is an apparent prolactin concentration that is only modestly elevated, suggesting that the macroadenoma is clinically nonfunctioning. The artifact can be avoided by repeating the assay using a 1:100 dilution of serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529482190\"><span class=\"h3\">Macroprolactin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two causes of hyperprolactinemia due to decreased clearance of prolactin include chronic renal failure and macroprolactin. The latter is prolactin bound to immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is usually 150 to 170 kDa in size, compared with 23 kDa for monomeric prolactin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This entity is not of clinical significance directly, but patients can be misdiagnosed and treated as ordinary hyperprolactinemia. Misdiagnosis can be avoided by asking the laboratory to pretreat the serum with polyethylene glycol to precipitate the macroprolactin before the immunoassay for prolactin. This entity is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;, section on 'Macroprolactinemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF HYPERPROLACTINEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an initial serum prolactin concentration is only slightly elevated (21 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [21 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units]), the test should be repeated before the patient is considered to have hyperprolactinemia. If serum prolactin is elevated on the second sample, hyperprolactinemia is confirmed, and the next step is to determine the cause. Most patients with hyperprolactinemia have a lactotroph adenoma. Therefore, the evaluation is aimed at (1) exclusion of pharmacologic or extrapituitary causes of hyperprolactinemia and (2) neuroradiologic evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A search for the cause of the hyperprolactinemia should begin with the history. One should inquire about pregnancy (nonpathologic hyperprolactinemia) and medications that can cause hyperprolactinemia (such as estrogen, neuroleptic drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, antidepressant drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>). One should also inquire about headache, visual symptoms, symptoms of hypothyroidism, and a history of renal disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should be directed toward testing for a chiasmal syndrome (eg, bitemporal field loss) and looking for chest wall injury and signs of hypothyroidism or hypogonadism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory/imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies should be performed to test for hypothyroidism and renal insufficiency.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head should be performed in a patient with any degree of hyperprolactinemia to look for a mass lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary region, unless the patient is taking a medication known to cause hyperprolactinemia.</p><p>If a mass lesion is found in the region of the sella turcica, secretion of other pituitary hormones should also be evaluated. Only a pituitary adenoma can cause hypersecretion of other pituitary hormones, but any mass lesion in the area of the sella can cause hyposecretion of one or more pituitary hormones. We therefore suggest measurements of serum prolactin (lactotroph adenomas), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (somatotroph adenomas), and 24-hour urinary free cortisol (corticotroph adenomas). Additional endocrine testing is needed when a gonadotroph or thyrotroph adenoma is suspected (luteinizing hormone [LH], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], total or free thyroxine [T4], and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], respectively). Although not generally useful in the differential diagnosis of a sellar mass, the possibility of hormonal hyposecretion should be evaluated in all patients who have a sellar mass in order to identify and replace hormone deficiencies.(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;, section on 'Hormonal evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for hypopituitarism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the MRI shows a normal hypothalamic-pituitary region and there are no obvious causes of hyperprolactinemia, the diagnosis of idiopathic hyperprolactinemia is made. This syndrome may, in some patients, be due to microadenomas that are too small to be seen on imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438375078\"><span class=\"h3\">MRI in drug-induced hyperprolactinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of elevation that can be attributed to a drug depends upon the drug. Most drugs do not cause an elevation to over 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> but the antipsychotic drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> can cause an elevation up to 300 or even 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Therefore, we recommend ordering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if the serum prolactin concentration is greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in patients taking a drug known to elevate the prolactin concentration but greater than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in those taking risperidone. There are no stimulatory or suppressive endocrine tests that distinguish between the causes of hyperprolactinemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">GALACTORRHEA WITHOUT HYPERPROLACTINEMIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum prolactin concentration is often normal in women who present with galactorrhea. In the largest series of patients presenting with galactorrhea, prolactin was normal in 46 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-hyperprolactinemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The likelihood that the prolactin is normal is even higher if menses are normal. No cause of this phenomenon has been documented, but often it represents persistent milk secretion following correction of elevated prolactin, most commonly after nursing or drug-induced hyperprolactinemia. Galactorrhea in the absence of hyperprolactinemia is not the result of any ongoing disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nipple-discharge\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nipple discharge&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in diagnosis is to be sure the breast secretion is clear or milky. Green or black fluid also usually represents milk, which can be confirmed by staining the fluid for fat. Blood in the fluid is a reason for referral for evaluation of a breast tumor. If the fluid is milk, the next step is to measure the serum prolactin concentration. If the prolactin is elevated, the cause should be sought, as described above. If the prolactin is not elevated, there is no ongoing disease, and no further tests are needed. Other causes of nipple discharge are discussed elsewhere.

For the unusual patient whose galactorrhea occurs spontaneously and to a degree that causes staining of the clothes, treatment with a low dose of dopamine agonist, such as 0.25 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> twice a week, will reduce the prolactin concentration to below normal and reduce or eliminate the galactorrhea.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Postmenopausal women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Men:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperprolactinemia also causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men, resulting in decreased libido and infertility. Other manifestations of hyperprolactinemia are erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia, and rarely, galactorrhea. As in women, there is a rough correlation between the presence of any of these symptoms and the degree of hyperprolactinemia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Men'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, or galactorrhea, and men with symptoms of hypogonadism, impotence, or gynecomastia should have a serum prolactin determination. The usual normal range for serum prolactin is 5 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (5 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the prolactin concentration is only slightly high (21 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [21 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> SI units]), it should be repeated before the patient is considered to have hyperprolactinemia. If the repeat value is still elevated, the next step is to determine the cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum prolactin values above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> usually indicate the presence of a lactotroph adenoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72540 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H125670444\" class=\"local\">'Serum prolactin concentrations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI of the head should be performed in patients with any degree of hyperprolactinemia to look for a mass lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary region, unless the patient is taking a medication known to cause hyperprolactinemia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory/imaging tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend ordering an MRI if the serum prolactin concentration is greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in patients taking a drug known to elevate the prolactin concentration but greater than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in those taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a>. (See <a href=\"#H438375078\" class=\"local\">'MRI in drug-induced hyperprolactinemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a mass lesion is found in the region of the sella turcica, secretion of other pituitary hormones should also be evaluated. Only a pituitary adenoma can cause hypersecretion of other pituitary hormones, but any mass lesion in the area of the sella can cause hyposecretion of one or more pituitary hormones.
