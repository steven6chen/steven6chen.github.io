Regardless of the cause, the response to liver injury includes collapse of hepatic lobules, formation of fibrous septae, and hepatocyte regeneration with nodule formation. Extracellular matrix components accumulate in the liver as a result of imbalances in their production, deposition, and degradation. This diffuse process may ultimately progress to cirrhosis, with its accompanying consequences of portal hypertension and impaired hepatic function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hepatic-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Hepatic fibrosis was originally thought to be irreversible, but it is now recognized as a dynamic process with the potential for significant resolution. New molecular insights into fibrogenesis and fibrosis regression offer potential targets for antifibrotic therapy and increase the need for noninvasive means to measure changes in fibrosis.</p><p>Conventional biochemical and serological tests, when examined alone, are of little value for the assessment of fibrosis. As a result, histopathological examination of a liver biopsy specimen is currently the gold standard for staging hepatic fibrosis. However, a liver biopsy has many limitations. Because it is invasive, it may be associated with complications, and it is usually not welcomed by patients. In addition, it can only sample a small portion of the liver and is thereby susceptible to sampling variation and inter- and intraobserver variability. These issues have led to the development of noninvasive means to estimate the amount of hepatic fibrosis present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-liver-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to liver biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the serologic and radiographic tests used for the noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis. Ultrasound-based elastography is discussed in more detail separately. The histologic assessment of hepatic fibrosis is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-ultrasound-based-elastography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: Ultrasound-based elastography&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-scoring-systems-for-chronic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic scoring systems for chronic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59529636\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGES OF FIBROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive tests of hepatic fibrosis attempt to predict the stage of hepatic fibrosis that would be seen histologically. There are several histologic scoring systems for chronic liver disease. Many use five-point scales such as the METAVIR score. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-scoring-systems-for-chronic-liver-disease#H23839890\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic scoring systems for chronic liver disease&quot;, section on 'METAVIR score'</a>.):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F0: No fibrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F1: Portal fibrosis without septa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F2: Few septa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F3: Numerous septa without cirrhosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F4: Cirrhosis</p><p/><p>Patients are typically considered to have significant fibrosis if their fibrosis score is &ge;F2. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H235749293\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive tests of hepatic fibrosis are primarily used for staging of fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease. We typically consider noninvasive testing for patients with chronic viral hepatitis at the time of initial evaluation to determine the likelihood of advanced liver fibrosis. In patients who are not successfully treated, subsequent testing is useful to determine if there is progression of fibrosis. The tests are also being used in patients with other chronic liver diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults#H75323532\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2223140\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Transient elastography'</a>.)</p><p>The tests are often used to differentiate patients with significant fibrosis (F2 to F4) from those with minimal or no fibrosis (F0 to F1). Many of the tests have been evaluated in specific populations (often patients with chronic hepatitis C virus [HCV]), which should be kept in mind when attempting to generalize the results to other populations. (See <a href=\"#H59529636\" class=\"local\">'Stages of fibrosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H235753063\" class=\"local\">'Serologic tests'</a> below and <a href=\"#H235753281\" class=\"local\">'Imaging tests'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with chronic HCV, the assessment of fibrosis progression can be valuable for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis) guides certain decisions regarding treatment, including optimal regimen and duration, and is a key factor that determines urgency of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H59529636\" class=\"local\">'Stages of fibrosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment may be delayed or deferred if little fibrosis progression has occurred over a long interval although guidelines recommend treating all patients with HCV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approximate time to the development of cirrhosis can be estimated.

In a study of 24 patients who were taking methotrexate and had undergone a liver biopsy, elastography correctly identified 88 percent of patients who did not have significant fibrosis, and FibroTest identified 83 percent of the patients who had significant fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H69601958\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound-based elastography'</a> below and <a href=\"#H235753455\" class=\"local\">'FibroTest, FibroSure, and ActiTest'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity associated with chronic low-dose methotrexate for nonmalignant disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61007147\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF TEST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two general categories of noninvasive tests for fibrosis: serologic panels of tests and radiologic tests. Serologic testing is more widely available. However, while tremendous progress has been made in improving the accuracy of serum markers of hepatic fibrosis, they cannot yet supplant direct histologic analysis. When available, radiologic measurement of elasticity can be used alone or in combination with serologic testing. We typically use a combination of serologic testing and ultrasound-based transient elastography. The specific tests chosen will depend on local availability. We often use the Hepascore panel as we have found it to be widely available and reliable. (See <a href=\"#H235754538\" class=\"local\">'Combining tests'</a> below.)</p><p>There are four commercial serum marker systems that have been extensively validated: <span class=\"nowrap\">FibroTest/FibroSure</span> (marketed in the United States by LabCorp), Hepascore (Quest Diagnostics), FibroSpect (Prometheus Corp), and the European Liver Fibrosis Study Group panel (not available in the United States). In addition, the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio (APRI) has also been studied extensively. The APRI has the advantage of being easily calculated using data available from routine laboratory tests. In the case of proprietary panels, the blood samples may need to be sent out for analysis. (See <a href=\"#H235753063\" class=\"local\">'Serologic tests'</a> below.)</p><p>All the serum tests have limitations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They typically reflect the rate of matrix turnover, not deposition, and thus tend to be more elevated when there is high inflammatory activity. By contrast, extensive matrix deposition can go undetected if there is minimal inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>None of the markers are liver-specific, and concurrent sites of inflammation may contribute to serum levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum levels are affected by clearance rates, which may be impaired either due to sinusoidal endothelial cell dysfunction or impaired biliary excretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are surrogates, not biomarkers.</p><p/><p>Radiologic methods for assessing hepatic fibrosis include ultrasound-based transient elastography, magnetic resonance elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, and cross-sectional imaging. Ultrasound-based transient elastography is the most widely used. Where available, these tests are often used in conjunction with serologic panels. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H235753063\"><span class=\"h1\">SEROLOGIC TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of serologic markers have been evaluated to predict the degree of fibrosis in the liver, and panels have been developed that combine assays of multiple markers to improve predictive ability. The most studied panels are the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio (APRI), <span class=\"nowrap\">FibroTest/FibroSure,</span> Hepascore, and FibroSpect. Overall, studies of the various panels suggest that they have good ability to differentiate patients with significant fibrosis (F2 to F4) from those without significant fibrosis (F0 to F1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A disadvantage of these panels is that they are not able to reliably differentiate between the different stages of fibrosis, and indeterminate outcomes are common (up to 50 percent with the FibroTest). No panel has yet emerged as the standard of care, and the choice of panel is often dictated by local availability.</p><p>Serologic markers of hepatic fibrosis can broadly be categorized as indirect or direct:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect markers reflect alterations in hepatic function, but do not directly reflect extracellular matrix metabolism. Examples include the platelet count, coagulation studies, and liver aminotransferases. (See <a href=\"#H235750743\" class=\"local\">'Panels of indirect markers of fibrosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct markers of fibrosis reflect extracellular matrix turnover. Examples include procollagen types I and III, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74005\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74005 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H235750827\" class=\"local\">'Direct markers of fibrosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The ability of panels of these markers to detect patients with significant fibrosis was examined in a systematic review of 14 studies of fibrosis panels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The median area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.82, suggesting good predictive ability. However, the tests were not able to reliably differentiate between the different stages of fibrosis, and the authors estimated that only 35 percent of patients would be classifiable as either having significant fibrosis or not having significant fibrosis. The remaining patients would have test results that were indeterminate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-diagnostic-tests#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating diagnostic tests&quot;, section on 'Receiver operating characteristic curves'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to detecting significant fibrosis, the panels may also be able to monitor changes in fibrosis over time. This monitoring over time may be more important than assessing the stage of disease at one particular time point since hepatic fibrogenesis is a dynamic process. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59530487\"><span class=\"h2\">Indirect markers of fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indirect markers of hepatic fibrosis include serologic biochemical tests that reflect alterations in hepatic function but do not directly reflect extracellular matrix metabolism. The individual markers include serum aminotransferase levels, platelet count, coagulation parameters, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and alpha-2-globulin (haptoglobin). These individual markers have been combined into serologic panels to predict the presence of hepatic fibrosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H235750743\"><span class=\"h3\">Panels of indirect markers of fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpretation of serum aminotransferase levels, coagulation parameters, and platelet count have been used in clinical practice to predict the presence or absence of cirrhosis. Several studies have also evaluated the accuracy of combinations (or ratios) of these measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].

A meta-analysis of 40 studies found that for predicting significant fibrosis (F2 to F4), an APRI cutoff of 0.7 had a sensitivity of 77 percent and a specificity of 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For predicting cirrhosis (F4), an APRI cutoff of 1.0 had a sensitivity of 76 percent and a specificity of 72 percent. However, accuracy was lower in patients coinfected with HIV and HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Thus, the APRI appears most useful for excluding significant fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV.</p><p>APRI has also been looked at in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

It also takes into account the patient's age and sex. Results from the individual assays are combined and are used to classify patients having mild fibrosis (F0 to F1), significant fibrosis (F2 to F4), or an indeterminate stage of fibrosis. The sensitivity for detection of significant fibrosis is approximately 60 to 75 and the specificity is approximately 80 to 90 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/23-26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26,28</a>].

Ultrasound-based elastography fulfills many features desirable of noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis; it is quick, inexpensive, reproducible, painless, and examines a large mass of liver tissue, thereby reducing sampling error. One system for performing ultrasound-based elastography, FibroScan, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. </p><p>Ultrasound-based elastography is discussed in detail elsewhere.

MRE has the advantage of scanning the entire liver and thus does not depend on an acoustic window. It may also detect lesions within the liver, such as hepatocellular carcinoma.

ARFI imaging uses short-duration, high-intensity acoustic pulses to produce mechanical excitation in tissue. This results in localized tissue displacement and shear wave propagation. The velocity of these waves correlates with the degree of fibrosis (the shear wave velocity increases as the amount of fibrosis increases), though optimal cutoff values vary among studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/133-145\" class=\"abstract_t\">133-145</a>]. In a representative study that included a training set of 88 patients, the sensitivity of ARFI imaging for &ge;F2 fibrosis was 85 percent using a cutoff of 1.44 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> and for F4 fibrosis was 92 percent using a cutoff of 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>].

There was no difference between ARFI and ultrasound-based transient elastography for the diagnosis of cirrhosis or severe fibrosis. ARFI performed better in patients who were not obese. Among non-obese patients the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for cirrhosis and severe fibrosis were 0.92 and 0.91, respectively.

However, the resolution of hepatic parenchyma with any of the available modalities is insufficient to detect earlier stages of fibrosis. The main role for imaging is the confirmation of cirrhosis in patients in whom there is a high clinical suspicion of advanced chronic liver disease. In addition, imaging can provide complementary information in patients with indeterminate liver biopsy results or biopsy results that are at variance with the clinical impression.</p><p>Morphologic volume measurements of the liver and spleen measured on abdomen CT with contrast can diagnose advanced fibrosis with reasonable accuracy. In one study, for discriminating &ge;F3 fibrosis, the liver segmental volume ratio (ratio of the volumes of segments I&ndash;III over segments IV&ndash;VIII) and the splenic volume demonstrated sensitivities of 72 percent and 81 percent, and specificities of 88 percent and 85 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>].

When the elastography and FibroTest results agreed, liver biopsy examination confirmed the stage of fibrosis in 84 percent of cases for F &ge;2 fibrosis, in 95 percent for F &ge;3 fibrosis, and in 94 percent for F = 4 fibrosis.
