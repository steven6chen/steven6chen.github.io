In addition, youth with bipolar disorder usually have recurrent episodes of major depression; however, depressive episodes are not necessary for making the diagnosis. Pediatric bipolar disorder severely affects normal development and psychosocial functioning and increases the risk for behavioral, academic, social, and legal problems, as well as psychosis, substance abuse, and suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>].</p><p>Multiple retrospective studies have reported that in up to 60 percent of adults with bipolar disorder, onset of mood symptoms occurred before age 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. However, pediatric bipolar disorder is often not recognized, and many youth with the disorder do not receive treatment or are treated for comorbid conditions rather than bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A retrospective study of 88 pediatric patients with bipolar disorder found that the duration of untreated bipolar disorder, from onset of the first mood episode to first mental health contact, was nearly two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In addition, youth can have difficulties verbalizing their emotions and symptoms, the symptoms of bipolar disorder overlap with symptoms of other psychiatric disorders, and pediatric bipolar disorder is characterized by high rates of comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>Prevalence estimates of pediatric bipolar disorder are based upon community surveys of school-age children as well as adolescents; the youngest age of participants in these studies is seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

However, preliminary studies suggest that neuroanatomical findings may perhaps serve as a diagnostic marker. As an example, a structural magnetic resonance imaging study found that abnormalities in the amygdala could be used to categorize youth with bipolar disorder (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 16), with good sensitivity (81 percent), specificity (75 percent), and positive predictive value (76 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Functional imaging in youths and adults with bipolar disorder suggests that both groups exhibit similar deficits in activation of some brain structures, and dissimilar deficits in other brain areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As an example, a motor inhibition task elicited hypoactivation of the nucleus accumbens in both youths (n = 16) and adults (n = 23); by contrast, the investigators observed hypoactivation of the anterior cingulate cortex in youths and hyperactivation in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Bipolar disorder in youth may be associated with abnormal concentrations of neural metabolites in the brain. As an example, studies that used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify the level of specific molecules have found increased concentrations of brain myoinositol in the prefrontal cortex of youth with bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Myoinositol may be involved in synthesis of myelin, and myoinositol levels may correlate with myelin turnover.

With the exception of other specified bipolar disorder, the prevalence in the United States and the rest of the world appears to be comparable (approximately 2 percent). The prevalence of pediatric bipolar disorder in the community has not increased over time. Clinicians in the United States appear to diagnose pediatric bipolar disorder, particularly other specified bipolar disorder, more often than clinicians in other countries. (See <a href=\"#H1674842762\" class=\"local\">'Definition of bipolar disorder'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1378897348\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of bipolar disorder in youth is not known, but studies suggest that biologic and psychosocial factors are involved. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that several brain networks involved in cognition (eg, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and emotional functioning (eg, amygdala) are affected in youth with bipolar disorder. As an example, the volume of the amygdala is smaller in youth with bipolar disorder than controls. White matter abnormalities have also been observed in youth with bipolar disorder. In addition, psychosocial factors that may be involved in the onset of pediatric bipolar disorder include low socioeconomic status, exposure to negative events (eg, childhood abuse), and high expressed-emotion.
