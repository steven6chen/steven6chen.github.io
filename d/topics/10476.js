The infant is born spontaneously in the vertex position between 37 and 42 completed weeks of pregnancy. After birth, mother and infant are in good condition&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will present a paradigm for intrapartum management of women who are expected to have a normal birth. Many of the options for managing these women have not been studied in clinical trials or the data from clinical trials are insufficient for making strong recommendations for a specific approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Therefore, much of our approach is based upon our clinical experience, data from observational studies, and expert opinion.</p><p>Management of women with complicated labor and delivery is discussed in separate topic reviews (eg, malpresentation, protraction and arrest disorders, preterm labor, operative vaginal delivery, maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/obstetrical</span> disorders, hemorrhage) (refer to individual topic reviews on each subject).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529196103\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1978331963\"><span class=\"h2\">Creating a satisfactory childbirth experience</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four factors important in determining a woman's satisfaction with her childbirth experience are personal expectations, the amount of support she receives, the quality of the caregiver-patient relationship, and her involvement in decision-making. Childbirth education classes inform women and their partners about what to expect during labor and birth and provide a foundation for developing personal plans for the birth experience.

There is consensus that women in active labor should be admitted; regular</p><p>contractions that require the woman&rsquo;s focus and attention, significant effacement (&ge;80 percent), and 4 to 5 cm dilation with documented cervical change are findings suggested by the National Partnership for Maternal Safety, since most women enter the active phase of labor at 4 to 6 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Given that women cannot check their cervical dilation or effacement, many women will present for a labor check before cervical dilation reaches 4 cm. If mother and fetus are well and transport to the hospital is not a concern, should these patients be admitted to the Labor and Delivery Unit or sent home? Both approaches are probably reasonable. Although women admitted before 4 cm cervical dilation are at higher risk for iatrogenic intervention, the maternal and perinatal consequences of sending these patients home have not been studied adequately.</p><p>In Washington State, the Bree Collaborative Obstetrics Care Report attempted to influence clinical practice by recommending admission for spontaneously laboring women at term with uncomplicated pregnancies only when cervical dilation was &ge;4 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The clinician determined whether the pregnancy was low-risk, as well as appropriate counseling and reassessment of women not admitted. Adherence to the recommendation was not mandatory. A retrospective cohort study of over 11,000 singleton, term deliveries in Washington State after this report observed a 10 to 15 percent increase in hospital admission at cervical dilation &ge;4 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Women admitted with cervical dilation &lt;4 cm were more likely to have epidural anesthesia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> augmentation, and a cesarean delivery than women admitted with cervical dilation &ge;4 cm. The authors were unable to identify women evaluated for labor, sent home because of cervical dilation &lt;4 cm, and subsequently admitted, thus the safety and efficacy of this approach could not be evaluated.</p><p>A large study from Texas reported that discharging patients with false labor at term after evaluation was not associated with an increase in adverse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Criteria for discharge were intact membranes, cervical dilation &lt;4 cm, no cervical change or contractions at the end of two hours observation, and normal fetal heart rate tracing. Patients were excluded from the study if they had pregnancy complications or a previous cesarean delivery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H414267876\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the initial examination of the parturient are to review her prenatal record for medical or obstetrical conditions that need to be addressed intrapartum, check for development of new disorders since the last prenatal visit, establish baseline cervical status so that subsequent progress can be determined, and evaluate fetal status.</p><p>On admission to the labor unit, vital signs include the woman's blood pressure; heart and respiratory rates; temperature; weight; frequency, quality, and duration of uterine contractions; and fetal heart rate (FHR).</p><p>Determining whether a woman is in labor is sometimes difficult as painful uterine contractions alone are not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of labor. Typically, the diagnosis is reserved for uterine contractions that result in cervical dilation and effacement over time. A recent history of membrane rupture or bloody show (vaginal discharge of a small amount of blood and mucus [ie, mucus plug]) supports the diagnosis.</p><p>Physical examination is performed with particular emphasis on the cervical examination.

An older system described fetal descent by dividing the distance from the ischial spines to pelvic outlet into thirds. Using this system, station <span class=\"nowrap\">+1/3</span> corresponds to <span class=\"nowrap\">+2/5</span> cm in the centimeter system. This assessment has largely been abandoned because it is even more subjective than the centimeter system and makes it difficult to document small, but clinically significant, degrees of descent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a cervical examination is not performed because of ruptured membranes or vaginal bleeding, fetal descent can also be described in terms of fifths of the fetal head palpable above the symphysis pubis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However, this risk is very low in the current era and restriction of oral intake can lead to dehydration and ketosis. We allow clear liquids to women at low risk of cesarean delivery, but restrict consumption of solid foods in accord with guidelines by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Obstetric Anesthesia that recommend avoidance of solid foods in laboring women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p>We provide maintenance intravenous fluids with 5 percent dextrose or 5 percent dextrose in 0.45 percent saline if oral intake is restricted or otherwise inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Glucose requirements in labor are analogous to the requirement observed with sustained and vigorous exercise, and intrapartum administration of glucose may be important for optimal myometrial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>]. </p><p>Dehydration adversely affects exercise performance and may be a factor contributing to longer duration of labor. Physiologists have shown that hydration improves skeletal muscle performance during prolonged exercise; however, the effects of hydration on smooth muscle are less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Among nulliparous women not allowed oral intake during labor, a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials found that the duration of labor may be shortened by about one hour with administration of intravenous fluids at a rate of 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> rather than 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> (mean difference -64.38 min, 95% CI -121.88 to -6.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The risk of cesarean delivery overall and for dystocia was also reduced (overall: 12.5 versus 18.1 percent; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.92; dystocia: 4.9 versus 7.7 percent; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.97). </p><p>The effect of glucose versus hydration on length of labor is unclear. In one of the only trials that compared length of labor in women randomly assigned to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> of normal saline, 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> of 5 percent dextrose in normal saline, or 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> of 2.5 percent dextrose in normal saline, length of labor was similar for all three groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Oral intake was limited to sips of water and ice chips. Thus, the type and rate of intravenous infusion does not appear to have a significant impact on labor duration in women with restricted oral intake.</p><p>When oral intake is not restricted, the benefit of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids is less clear. A 2017 systematic review of 10 randomized trials comparing less-restrictive food intake policies with more restrictive food intake policies during labor in women with low-risk singleton pregnancies found that less restrictive policies resulted in a slightly shorter duration of labor (-7 to -25 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

However, if the FHR tracing is normal and station is high, we often ask women to delay pushing until the further descent has occurred to reduce the duration of time of maximal maternal exertion (ie, &quot;laboring down&quot;). This decision is based on patient-specific factors, such as whether there is a need to expedite delivery, maternal fatigue, and maternal preference. There are no strong data that one approach is better than another. </p><p>We have the patient push in the position she finds most comfortable. Upright positions where the pelvis is in a vertical plane (eg, walking, standing, sitting, supported kneeling) have several theoretical benefits, such as an increase in pelvic dimensions and good fetal alignment. The supine position should be avoided because of aortocaval compression, but a left or right lateral position avoids this complication and is acceptable. A Cochrane review of randomized trials comparing second stage upright (sitting, squatting, kneeling) versus lying (lateral, semi-recumbent, lithotomy, Trendelenburg) position in women without epidural anesthesia found that no position was clearly superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In women with epidural anesthesia, results of another meta-analysis favored a lateral lying down position because the odds of spontaneous vaginal delivery were lower in women assuming an upright position (odds ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92). A large randomized trial included in the analysis, found no differences between groups for instrumental vaginal delivery, obstetric anal sphincter injury, or newborn outcomes. All trials evaluating labor position are limited by lack of blinding and by crossover between groups.</p><p>The optimum pushing technique is also unclear. We favor allowing the woman to bear down when she feels the need (ie, spontaneous pushing or physiologic pushing), unless epidural anesthesia has inhibited the bearing down sensation. We advise against Valsalva pushing (pushing with a closed glottis), as there is no clinically significant benefit to this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Women are typically told to pull back their knees, tuck in their chin, take a deep breath, bear down at the start of a contraction, and push for 10 seconds with the goal of three pushes per contraction. However, there is no evidence that coaching women in this way has any benefit over allowing them to bear down and push according to their own reflex needs in response to the pain of contractions and the pressure felt from descent of the fetal head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>A 2017 meta-analysis of pooled data from 21 randomized trials of different approaches to pushing reported the following major findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No clear difference in the length of the second stage or duration of pushing when women follow their own instincts about breathing while pushing (spontaneous pushing) versus asking them to take a deep breath at the beginning of a contraction and holding the breath as long as possible while bearing down (directed pushing with Valsalva maneuver)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with epidural analgesia, delayed pushing lengthened the second stage by about one hour and decreased pushing duration by a mean of 19 minutes compared with immediate pushing.

Once the fetal head delivers, external rotation (restitution) occurs spontaneously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71178\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71178 \">figure 8</a>). A meta-analysis of three trials that evaluated manual perineal support found that it did not significantly reduce obstetrical anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) (RR, 1.03, 95% CI 0.32&ndash;3.36), although three nonrandomized studies suggested a benefit (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40&ndash;0.50). Since the techniques for perineal support were not well described, it is difficult to interpret these findings. The role of various obstetric factors on anal sphincter injury and postpartum function are discussed separately.

These movements should be performed with as little downward or upward force as possible to avoid perineal injury <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> traction injuries to the brachial plexus.

However, suctioning immediately after birth is appropriate for newborns with obvious obstruction to spontaneous breathing due to secretions or who are likely to require positive-pressure ventilation. The mouth is suctioned first and then the nares to decrease the risk for aspiration (newborns are obligate nose breathers). Suctioning of the posterior pharynx should be avoided, as it can stimulate a vagal response, resulting in apnea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia.

The American Academy of Pediatrics also endorses this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Although the optimal amount of time before cord clamping has not been studied extensively, we believe data support a minimum delay of at least one minute in term births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. ACOG suggests a delay of at least 30 to 60 seconds; others have suggested a 2- to 5-minute delay (or longer if the mother requests) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Delaying cord clamping should not interfere with timely care of the newborn and should never compromise the safety of the mother or newborn. For example, it is not appropriate when the mother or newborn is unstable or when the newborn-placental circulation is not intact (eg, abruption, previa, cord avulsion). It may not be appropriate in cases of fetal growth restriction with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies, as these newborns may already have polycythemia and hyperviscosity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In term infants, the main advantage of delayed cord clamping is higher infant iron stores at six months of age, which may be particularly advantageous when the mother has a low ferritin level or plans to breastfeed without supplementing with iron or fortified formula. Disadvantages of delayed cord clamping include an increase in hyperbilirubinemia in the immediate newborn period resulting in more phototherapy and an increased risk of polycythemia in growth-restricted neonates. Delaying cord clamping also reduces the volume of umbilical cord blood available for harvesting stem cells; thus, the size and cell dose of collected cord blood units may not be adequate for a future hematopoietic cell transplant if cord clamping is delayed. This should be considered when cord blood collection is planned for this purpose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Collection and storage of umbilical cord blood for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A 2013 meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials including 3911 mothers and their infants evaluated early versus late (two to three minutes after birth) cord clamping in term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Compared with early cord clamping, late cord clamping resulted in higher neonatal hemoglobin levels at 24 to 48 hours after birth (mean difference 1.49 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> but not in subsequent assessments, and a lower proportion of infants with iron deficiency at three to six months of age (14 percent of infants in the early clamping group versus 8 percent in the late clamping group). However, late cord clamping also resulted in a 40 percent increase in newborns needing phototherapy for jaundice (2.74 percent of infants in the early clamping group versus 4.36 percent in the late clamping group).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, the only randomized clinical trial that assessed the effects of delayed cord clamping compared with early cord clamping at four years of age reported a possible benefit in some neurodevelopmental outcomes, particularly in boys, and no harmful effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preterm infants</strong> &ndash; We delay cord clamping for at least 30 seconds in vigorous preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], but available data (discussed below) do not strongly support one approach over another; therefore, physicians should use their judgment about whether and how long to delay cord clamping in individual preterm infants until definitive data are available. Although a benefit has not been demonstrated consistently, delayed cord clamping is unlikely to be harmful. Differences among populations and physician judgment as to whether it was safe to delay cord clamping likely impacted the precision of the following data.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials of delayed (typically &ge;60 seconds) versus early (typically &le;10 seconds) cord clamping in preterm deliveries (18 trials, n =2834 infants), delayed clamping, when safe to do so:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduced neonatal hospital mortality by approximately 30 percent (risk ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.52&ndash;0.90; number needed to benefit 33, 95% CI 20-100).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased peak hematocrit by 2.73 percentage points (95% CI 1.94-3.52) and reduced the proportion of infants having blood transfusion by 10 percent (95% CI 6-13 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased peak serum bilirubin by 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> without increasing morbidity (eg, partial exchange transfusions for polycythemia, exchange transfusions for hyperbilirubinemia).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Did not reduce the incidence of intubation for resuscitation, admission temperature, mechanical ventilation, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, brain injury, chronic lung disease, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, late onset sepsis or severe retinopathy of prematurity, nor did it increase morbidity from these entities (subgroup analysis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In preterm infants, providing more time for the physiological transition from fetal to newborn life is an advantage of delayed cord clamping and possibly accounts for the significant reductions in intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis associated with this intervention seen in some studies. Approximately 75 percent of blood available for placenta-to-fetus transfusion is transfused in the first minute after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Delaying cord clamping increases the volume of placental blood transfused to the fetus and thereby increases neonatal blood volume, improves neonatal and infant iron stores, and decreases neonatal and infant anemia. It also facilitates the fetal to neonatal transition. Clamping the cord before initiation of spontaneous respirations (mean onset of respiration is 10&plusmn;15 seconds after expulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]) appears to adversely affect cardiovascular hemodynamics during the fetal to neonatal transition, likely due to removal of umbilical venous return before dilation of the pulmonary vascular bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/90-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-93</a>]. Lung aeration triggers an increase in pulmonary blood flow, which supplies most of the preload to the left ventricle; if cord clamping precedes onset of respiration, ventricular preload falls because the loss of umbilical venous return is not balanced by an increase in pulmonary venous return [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. This may partially account for some of the non-hematologic benefits reported in trials of delayed cord clamping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6365163\"><span class=\"h2\">Cord milking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not milk or strip the umbilical cord; however, this practice is an alternative to delayed clamping for enhancing blood transfusion. Depending on technique, cord milking may be more efficient than delayed cord clamping for improving neonatal blood volume. A randomized trial in preterm infants found that milking the accessible length of the cord four times at a speed of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/2</span> seconds was equivalent to delaying cord clamping for 30 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. </p><p/><p>Cord milking, like delayed cord clamping, may help stabilize blood pressure and increase urinary output in premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-98</a>], but a theoretic concern is that a non-quantifiable amount of blood will be given to an immature infant in an uncontrolled fashion, which could be harmful. In a 2015 meta-analysis of seven randomized trials (n = 501 infants) of umbilical cord milking versus usual care, umbilical cord milking significantly increased hemoglobin levels without increasing the need for phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. In the 277 infants &lt;33 weeks, however, the need for blood transfusion was not reduced and the intervention did not significantly reduce mortality, hypotension requiring volume expanders or inotrope support, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, or necrotizing enterocolitis rates. These data do not provide convincing evidence for or against umbilical cord milking.</p><p>Delivery should not be unnecessarily delayed to milk the cord in situations where immediate pediatric assistance is needed, such as thick meconium or neonatal depression.

(See <a href=\"#H529196103\" class=\"local\">'Preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of the initial examination of the parturient are to review her prenatal record for medical or obstetrical conditions that need to be addressed intrapartum, check for development of new disorders since the last prenatal visit, establish baseline cervical status so that subsequent progress can be determined, and evaluate fetal status. (See <a href=\"#H414267876\" class=\"local\">'Initial examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Results from the following laboratory tests should be available at delivery, but intrapartum assessment is not always necessary: <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit,</span> blood type and screen, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B antigen, syphilis, rectovaginal group B streptococcus. (See <a href=\"#H414268291\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women who have not had HIV screening or whose HIV status is undocumented should be offered rapid HIV testing in labor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We recommend not performing routine enemas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>) and we suggest not routinely shaving the perineum (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Patient preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus on acceptable maternal oral intake or need for and type of intravenous fluids during an uncomplicated labor. We allow patients at low risk of cesarean delivery to have clear liquids and we place an intravenous line or heparin lock for all women in labor. We administer a glucose containing solution to women receiving intravenous fluids, and provide maintenance fluids when oral intake is restricted or otherwise inadequate to avoid volume depletion and ketosis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Fluids and oral intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal delivery is not an indication for routine antibiotic prophylaxis, even in women with cardiac lesions, since the rate of bacteremia is low. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis to prevent early-onset neonatal GBS infection is indicated for patients who meet standard criteria; the agent of choice is intravenous penicillin. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Systemic antibiotics'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: Prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal preferences can guide maternal activity. Walking during the first stage does not appear to enhance or impair labor progress. Laboring women should assume positions that are comfortable, unless specific positions are needed because of maternal-fetal status and need for close monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H12459586\" class=\"local\">'Maternal activity and position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and anesthetic options are available to help women manage pain during labor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-approaches-to-management-of-labor-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic approaches to management of labor pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic management of pain during labor and delivery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuraxial analgesia for labor and delivery (including instrumented delivery)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not performing amniotomy routinely (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). There is no convincing evidence of benefit in spontaneously laboring women, and rupture of membranes increases the risk of ascending infection and cord prolapse. (See <a href=\"#H333694554\" class=\"local\">'Amniotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with pregnancies at increased risk of fetal compromise during labor, we perform continuous electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring, in agreement with clinical management guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. We also monitor low-risk pregnancies continuously because it is more practical than intermittent monitoring, but we are not rigid about this if the patient understands the risks and benefits of intermittent monitoring and has an uncomplicated pregnancy, normal FHR tracing, and is not resting in bed. Contractions and labor progress are also monitored. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal pushing position technique, position, and duration are unclear. We suggest patients push in the position they find most comfortable and with an open glottis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, if the FHR tracing is normal and station is high, we often ask women to delay pushing until the further descent has occurred to reduce the duration of time of maximal maternal exertion. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Pushing position and technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend not performing episiotomy routinely (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-episiotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to episiotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; technique (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Preventing precipitous expulsion of the newborn can reduce the risk of obstetrical and anal sphincter injury. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Delivery of the newborn'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine oro-nasopharyngeal suctioning of newborns by a bulb or catheter is not beneficial, including those with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Suctioning is appropriate for newborns with obvious obstruction to spontaneous breathing or who are likely to require positive-pressure ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H520853256\" class=\"local\">'Oropharyngeal care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Meconium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In preterm births who do not require resuscitation, we suggest delayed cord clamping (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Benefits may include reduced rates of transfusion, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and hypotension, although a lack of benefit has also been reported. For term infants who do not require resuscitation, we suggest delayed cord clamping (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, not routinely delaying cord clamping is also reasonable as the improvement in iron stores needs to be balanced with the disadvantage of an increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia and more need for phototherapy. We delay clamping at least 30 seconds in preterm infants and at least one minute in term infants. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Cord clamping'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cord milking is an alternative to cord clamping and results in more rapid blood transfusion when time is a factor. (See <a href=\"#H6365163\" class=\"local\">'Cord milking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delaying cord clamping reduces the volume of umbilical cord blood available for harvesting stem cells; therefore, the size and cell dose of collected cord blood units may not be adequate for a future hematopoietic cell transplant if cord clamping is delayed. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Cord clamping'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active management of the third stage reduces maternal blood loss and risk of postpartum hemorrhage compared with expectant management. We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> and apply controlled traction of the umbilical cord. The placenta should be examined to make sure it is intact. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Active management and delivery of the placenta'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Average blood loss at vaginal delivery is estimated to be &lt;500 mL. Excessive bleeding may be related to atony, trauma, coagulopathy, placental abnormalities, or uterine inversion. (See <a href=\"#H414269191\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to recognize and repair a rectal injury can lead to serious long-term morbidity, most notably fecal incontinence. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Repair of lacerations'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">World Health Organization, Maternal and Newborn Health/Safe Motherhood Unit.
