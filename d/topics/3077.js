These abnormalities usually result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism) or disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism). In occasional cases, however, a defect in the ability to respond to testosterone is the cause of hypogonadism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disorders-of-the-androgen-receptor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the androgen receptor&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between primary and secondary hypogonadism is made by measurement of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has primary hypogonadism if the serum testosterone concentration and the sperm count are below normal and the serum LH and FSH concentrations are above normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has secondary hypogonadism if the serum testosterone concentration and the sperm count are subnormal and the serum LH and FSH concentrations are normal or reduced.</p><p/><p>Primary hypogonadism differs from secondary hypogonadism in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary hypogonadism is more likely to be associated with a decrease in sperm production than in testosterone production. Although many testicular diseases damage both the seminiferous tubules and the Leydig cells, they usually damage the seminiferous tubules to a greater degree. As a consequence, the sperm count may be low and the serum FSH concentration normal or high, yet the serum testosterone concentration remains normal. In contrast, in secondary hypogonadism, there is a proportionate reduction in testosterone and sperm production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary hypogonadism is more likely to be associated with gynecomastia, presumably due to the stimulatory effect of the supranormal serum FSH and LH concentrations on testicular aromatase activity. This results in increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol and enhanced testicular secretion of estradiol relative to testosterone.</p><p/><p>The major causes of primary hypogonadism in males will be reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53842\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53842 \">table 1</a>). The causes of secondary hypogonadism and of male infertility, which may or may not be associated with hypogonadism, and the manifestations and diagnosis of hypogonadism in males are discussed separately.

This syndrome is the clinical manifestation of a male who has an extra X chromosome. The most common genotype is <strong>47,XXY</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72095\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72095 \">figure 1</a>), but greater and lesser numbers of X chromosomes have also been reported, resulting in karyotypes such as 48,XXXY and <span class=\"nowrap\">46,XY/47,XXY</span> mosaicism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. 46,XX males also have Klinefelter syndrome; the development of testes in this setting is presumably due to translocation of a small portion of chromosomal material containing the <strong>testis-determining factor</strong> to an X chromosome.</p><p>The 47,XXY genotype results from nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes of either parent during meiotic division, while mosaicism probably results from nondisjunction during mitotic division after conception. The greater the number of extra X chromosomes, the greater the phenotypic consequences, both gonadal and extragonadal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage to the seminiferous tubules and, usually, damage to the Leydig cells as well. The gonadal manifestations include almost invariably small, firm testes; severely subnormal sperm count; infertility; elevated serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations; variably subnormal serum testosterone concentration; and decreased virilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

As an example, in a study of 77 newly diagnosed and untreated Klinefelter patients (48 of whom were hypogonadal), longer CAGn length was associated with taller stature, lower bone mineral density, gynecomastia, and employment not requiring a high level of education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a similar study of 35 patients with Klinefelter syndrome, longer CAGn length was inversely correlated with penile length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome usually can be made by determining the karyotype of the peripheral leukocytes. Testosterone deficiency and the resulting hypogonadism, if present, can be treated with testosterone (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testosterone treatment of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>). Hormone replacement is unlikely to improve the other abnormalities. Fertility has been achieved with assisted reproductive technologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], but there are important genetic implications of these procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;</a>). The clinician should discuss the nature of the problem with the patient, his parents, and his teachers and counselors and should also encourage them to contact a support group.

The gonads vary from streak to dysgenetic to normal testes; as a result, the sexual phenotype varies from complete female to complete male. If the patient has both a streak gonad and a dysgenetic testis (&quot;mixed gonadal dysgenesis&quot;), the risk of gonadoblastoma is approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

These abnormalities usually result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism), disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism), or, more rarely, a defect in the ability to respond to testosterone.
