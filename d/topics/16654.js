Distal pancreatectomy, which removes the body and tail of the pancreas, accounts for approximately 25 percent of all pancreatic resections. Distal pancreatectomy was first performed by Billroth in 1884. Less extensive resections can also be performed in the form of central pancreatectomy, which removes part of the body of the pancreas, or enucleation, which limits the resection to the lesion and immediately adjacent parenchyma. </p><p>The indications, preoperative evaluation and preparation, and techniques for resecting lesions of the body and the tail of the pancreas will be reviewed here. Resection of the head of the pancreas requires concomitant resection of the duodenum (ie, pancreaticoduodenectomy) and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-head-of-the-pancreas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical resection of lesions of the head of the pancreas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H754640779\"><span class=\"h1\">PANCREATIC ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pancreas is a compound exocrine and endocrine gland located in the retroperitoneum at the level of the second lumbar vertebrae. Exocrine pancreatic secretion is composed of enzymes, water, electrolytes, and bicarbonate, which are delivered to the duodenum via the pancreatic duct of Wirsung and aid with digestion. Endocrine secretions include insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin from the islets of Langerhans, A cells, and D cells, respectively. Removal of up to 90 percent of the mass of the pancreas can be performed without resulting in diabetes. </p><p>The pancreas is divided into five parts including the head, uncinate process, neck, body, and tail (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F108050\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108050 \">figure 1</a>). The head of the pancreas lies to the right of the superior mesenteric artery. The uncinate process is a variable posterolateral extension of the head that passes behind the retropancreatic vessels and anterior to the inferior vena cava and aorta. The neck is defined as the portion of the gland overlying the superior mesenteric vessels. The body and tail lie to the left of the mesenteric vessels; there is no meaningful anatomic division between the body and tail. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H754640866\"><span class=\"h2\">Ductal anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pancreatic duct, located at the posterior (dorsal) aspect of the gland, joins the common bile duct to drain into the duodenum via the major papilla (ampulla of Vater) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78786 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63728\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63728 \">picture 1</a>). The anatomy of these ducts can vary. In 85 percent of individuals, the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct enter the duodenum through a common channel. In 5 percent of patients, both ducts enter the duodenum through the same ampulla but via separate channels. In the remaining 10 percent of patients, each duct enters the duodenum through a separate ampulla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The entry of the common bile duct into the pancreatic tissue posteriorly can also vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52079 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H754640873\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurovascular supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arterial supply to the duodenum and pancreas is derived from the celiac artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60042\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60042 \">figure 4</a>), providing the superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (anterior and posterior branches), and the superior mesenteric artery, providing the inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (anterior and posterior branches) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53700\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53700 \">figure 5</a>). The splenic artery supplies primarily the body and tail of the pancreas. The venous drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65365\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65365 \">figure 6</a>) follows the arteries to provide tributaries to the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein, which drain into the portal vein.</p><p>The pancreas is innervated by sympathetic fibers from the splanchnic nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73063\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73063 \">figure 7</a>) and parasympathetic fibers from the vagus, both of which give rise to intrapancreatic periacinar nerve plexuses. The parasympathetic fibers stimulate exocrine and endocrine function, whereas the sympathetic fibers have an inhibitory effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR DISTAL PANCREATECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal pancreatectomy is performed primarily for malignant and premalignant diseases of the pancreas, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cystic neoplasms, neuroendocrine tumors, and, rarely, isolated metastasis to the gland. In one series of 232 distal pancreatectomies, of which 164 were performed for pancreas-specific disease, malignant or premalignant disease was resected in 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Benign indications for distal pancreatectomy include chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocysts, and trauma associated with pancreatic ductal disruption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with adenocarcinoma in the body and tail of the gland have historically presented with more advanced disease because lesions in this area can become larger before patients develop symptoms, the most common of which is pain. Body and tail lesions tend to be less resectable and are associated with shorter survival than adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head, even though the biology of the tumors is the same [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Improved high-resolution pancreatic-protocol computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques have improved the early recognition of lesions involving the body and tail of the pancreas. As a result, distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is becoming more frequently performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroendocrine tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroendocrine tumors within the body and tail of the pancreas can be resected or enucleated depending upon the size and relationship of the tumor to the pancreatic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Nonfunctioning tumors that are large or preoperatively confirmed (via endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy) as high grade using the World Health Organization Classification system should be resected rather than enucleated to achieve a margin-negative resection and appropriate lymph node harvest. Likewise, lesions close to the main pancreatic duct should also be resected, rather than enucleated, to minimize the potential for a postoperative pancreatic leak and fistula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-localization-and-staging-of-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, epidemiology, clinical presentation, localization, and staging of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is ongoing debate regarding the resection of primary malignant neuroendocrine tumors in the face of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Resection may be appropriate if the primary site of the tumor is causing symptoms, or when primary tumor and associated liver metastases are each amenable to potentially curative resection. Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines suggest that tumors 1 cm or less may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

MCNs and SPENs are most commonly located in the body and tail of the gland, serous cystadenomas have equal distribution throughout the gland, and IPMNs (main duct, branch duct, and mixed types) are primarily located in the head of the gland but can be found throughout the gland.

Indications for treatment include rapidly enlarging or symptomatic cysts. Treatment options include percutaneous drainage, endoscopic drainage, internal surgical drainage, or resection, including distal pancreatectomy. Distal pancreatectomy is usually reserved for cases where disruption of the main pancreatic duct (with or without a failed attempt at stenting) has occurred, or if there has been significant involvement of an adjacent structure (eg, splenic artery pseudoaneurysm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

High-resolution abdominal imaging is needed to determine the size, location, and relation of any masses or cysts to surrounding structures, and for patients with disruption of the pancreatic duct, to assess the location and amount of peripancreatic fluid, including potential fluid in the lesser sac. </p><p>Following the injection of IV contrast, 2- to 3-mm images of the pancreas are obtained during the &quot;pancreatic arterial phase,&quot; and then 5-mm images are later captured during the &quot;venous phase.&quot; During the pancreatic phase, the pancreatic parenchyma, celiac axis, and superior mesenteric artery are enhanced with contrast, while during the venous phase, the superior mesenteric vein, portal vein, and splenic vein are enhanced. If the institution does not have a well-established pancreas CT protocol, then high-resolution CT with IV contrast may be sufficient. </p><p>Some surgeons prefer a magnetic resonance imaging and cholangiopancreatogram (MRCP) instead of a pancreas CT protocol or high-resolution CT scan.

The liver surface and peritoneum should first be inspected for distant disease. Any suspicious nodules should be biopsied and sent for frozen section analysis. Next, the transverse colon should be lifted anteriorly to inspect the mesocolon for direct extension. The lesser sac can be explored by dividing the gastrocolic ligament, but this is rarely needed for diagnostic purposes. Vascular involvement can be assessed by direct inspection or by using a laparoscopic Doppler probe, although this technique is probably more useful for periampullary tumors where vascular involvement frequently determines resectability.

An attempt at splenic preservation can be made when treating small neuroendocrine tumors in the body and tail of the pancreas that are likely benign, and premalignant cystic lesions without any objective signs of advanced pathology (eg, large size, mural nodules, or solid component) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. However, splenic salvage may not be technically possible for lesions that involve the splenic vessels, for large cysts or tumors, or lesions associated with significant inflammation that obscure the borders of the distal pancreas. Whether or not to preserve the spleen should be decided on a case-by-case basis. Distal pancreatectomy with splenic preservation can be accomplished using an open or laparoscopic approach. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopic approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/2,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,40,41</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>] series have demonstrated benefits to splenic preservation, including lower perioperative infectious complications. A systematic review that included 11 observational studies for a total of 897 patients identified a significantly lower incidence of intra-abdominal abscess for spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (open, laparoscopic) compared with distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy (5.1 versus 11.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The rate of splenic infarction with splenic salvage was 2.5 percent. No differences were identified for operative time or the incidence of bleeding, pancreatic fistula, wound infection, or thrombosis. However, splenic preservation can lead to splenic enlargement, hypersplenism, and gastric varices if the splenic vein is sacrificed at the time of pancreatic resection. Some surgeons advocate maintaining vascularization to the spleen via the splenic artery and vein, while others resect these vessels and maintain only the short gastric vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. We preserve at least one-half of the short gastric vessels during mobilization of the pancreas in case splenic vein preservation, which requires meticulous and tedious dissection of enumerable small and fragile venous tributaries, cannot be achieved. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129385914\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic transection and closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transection of the pancreas can be performed using a variety of methods, including sharp division and subsequent oversewing of the transection line, or using stapling devices (with or without staple line reinforcement) that simultaneously divide and close the cut end. Alternative techniques include a handsewn closure, placement of a seromuscular patch, reinforcement with mesh, ultrasonic dissection, use of bipolar scissors, sealing the end with fibrin glue, and creating a pancreaticoenteric anastomosis. General issues related to creating a pancreaticoenteric anastomosis, which is more commonly used for gastrointestinal reconstruction following pancreaticoduodenectomy, are discussed elsewhere.

We generally use a stapled technique for distal pancreatectomy, regardless of whether the approach is open or laparoscopic. A systematic review that included two trials and eight observational studies found a trend toward a lower pancreatic leak rate with stapled closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

A later trial (DISPACT [DIStal PAnCreaTectomy] trial) randomly assigned 177 patients to stapled closure and 175 patients to handsewn closure and found no significant difference in incidence of pancreatic fistula rate between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

In a trial that randomly assigned 100 patients to mesh or no mesh, the incidence of clinically important leaks, defined as ISGPF (International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula) grade B and C, was significantly lower in the staple line mesh compared with the nonmesh group (20 versus 1.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative pancreatic fistula'</a> below.)</p><p>Although drain placement after pancreatic resection remains commonplace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], the role of routine drainage after distal pancreatectomy remains ill defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. The use of abdominal drains, in general, is highly controversial, and evidence supports the limiting use of prophylactic intra-abdominal drainage for many procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]. A multicenter randomized trial that included 344 patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy showed no difference in the rate of grade 2 or higher complications (44 versus 42 percent), pancreatic fistulas (18 versus 12 percent), and mortality (0 versus 1 percent), with or without intraperitoneal drainage.

These include endocrine neoplasms, cystadenomas, noninvasive intraductal mucinous tumors, solid cystic papillary tumors, and other less common benign lesions. Central pancreatectomy has a limited role in the treatment of malignant lesions, although it may be an option in the palliative treatment of metastatic disease to the pancreas (eg, renal carcinoma). </p><p>A systematic review identified 94 studies involving 963 patients and compared outcomes for patients undergoing central pancreatectomy versus distal pancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Central pancreatectomy was associated with a significantly higher overall incidence of postoperative morbidity (46 versus 29 percent) and a higher incidence of pancreatic fistula (31 versus 14 percent) compared with distal pancreatectomy, but a lower risk of endocrine insufficiency (4 versus 23 percent).

Somatostatin and its analogues may have an overall benefit in reducing morbidity following pancreatic operations, but the variable methods by which the agent is administered, outcomes reported, and definitions of complications, and particularly the definition of a pancreatic fistula, make it difficult to compare studies, or clearly identify a subgroup for whom prophylactic treatment might be considered, and the optimal means by which it should be administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].

The overall rate of the secondary endpoint of grade B or C postoperative pancreatic fistula was also significantly reduced in the pasireotide group (7.9 versus 16.9 percent).

These include pancreatic adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors, premalignant and cystic tumors, pseudocyst, pancreatic trauma, and chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for distal pancreatectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nature of the lesion determines the extent of resection (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Distal pancreatectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H129385199\" class=\"local\">'Central pancreatectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H124021226\" class=\"local\">'Enucleation procedures'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distal pancreatectomy involves resecting the body and tail of the pancreas with or without splenectomy. This is typically accomplished using a retrograde anatomic approach, but the radical antegrade modular pancreaticosplenectomy (RAMPS) procedure is an alternative approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Central pancreatectomy removes a limited portion of the pancreas, sparing the tail. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Enucleation is used to remove focal (&lt;2 cm) benign lesions, depending upon their relationship to the pancreatic duct. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to elective resection of the distal pancreas, all patients should undergo pancreatic imaging to determine the size, location, and relationship of the suspect lesion to surrounding structures, and for patients with disruption of the pancreatic duct, to assess the location and amount of peripancreatic fluid. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing elective resection of the distal pancreas, we recommend antimicrobial prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Patients for whom antibiotics have been initiated to manage established preoperative infection should be re-dosed prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-lesions-of-the-body-and-tail-of-the-pancreas/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

We also place intermittent pneumatic compression devices prior to induction and continue their use until the patient is ambulatory. (See <a href=\"#H754640728\" class=\"local\">'Thromboprophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients#H267528883\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;, section on 'Selecting prophylaxis options'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing resection of the distal pancreas for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, we suggest staging laparoscopy immediately prior to proceeding with the pancreatic resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Staging laparoscopy identifies occult peritoneal metastases or local invasion that contraindicates resection. (See <a href=\"#H754641087\" class=\"local\">'Staging laparoscopy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H1618421\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Staging laparoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most pancreatic lesions, the extent of resection of pancreatic tissue should be sufficient to achieve a disease-free margin on intraoperative frozen section analysis. An exception may be main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), where low-grade dysplasia at the margin is acceptable. (See <a href=\"#H754641241\" class=\"local\">'Extent of resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When performing pancreatectomy for a lesion of the distal pancreas that is biopsy-proven or highly suspicious for cancer, we perform concomitant splenectomy. Splenectomy ensures better local control and peripancreatic lymph node sampling. Splenic preservation is acceptable when treating small neuroendocrine tumors that are likely to be benign, and premalignant cystic lesions with no signs of advanced pathology. For patients in whom splenectomy is anticipated, preoperative immunization should be given prior to surgery, or postoperatively if vaccination was not possible prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H124021342\" class=\"local\">'Splenectomy and lymphadenectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H754640242\" class=\"local\">'Immunization'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pancreatic transection and closure technique chosen should be based upon the character of the pancreatic tissue and the experience of the surgeon. There is no convincing evidence to support any one technique over another. Among the available techniques, we prefer a stapled pancreatic closure. (See <a href=\"#H129385914\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic transection and closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative mortality is overall low at high-volume centers but increases with more aggressive resections for cancer. Complications following distal pancreatectomy are common, occurring in up to 40 percent of patients, primarily related to the sequelae of pancreatic leak. Other surgical complications include splenic vein thrombosis, new-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, intra-abdominal abscess, and postoperative bleeding.
