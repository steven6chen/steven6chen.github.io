It is most effective for stones in the renal pelvis and upper ureter, and it is less effective for larger stones (&gt;1.5 cm), stones of harder composition (cystine, calcium oxalate monohydrate), and stones in complex renal or ureteral locations (lower pole calyx or middle or lower ureter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Although ESWL is highly effective in appropriately selected patients, a number of urinary tract complications can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The renal complications of ESWL will be reviewed here. The role of ESWL and other modalities in the treatment of nephrolithiasis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options in the management of renal and ureteral stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Shock wave lithotripsy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ureteral-calculi#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ureteral calculi&quot;, section on 'Shock wave lithotripsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four potential renal and urinary tract complications of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incomplete stone fragmentation, which can lead to urinary tract obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal parenchymal injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevation in blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159459600\"><span class=\"h2\">Incomplete stone fragmentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incomplete stone fragmentation leading to residual stone fragments is a limitation of ESWL and, as noted above, is most common with larger stones and stones of harder composition. The stone fragments can usually pass (though usually accompanied by typical symptoms including pain) if they are less than 4 to 5 mm in diameter, but even fragments as small as 2 to 3 mm can cause pain. In a multicenter study of 925 patients (1157 procedures), the rate of ureteral obstruction rate when ESWL was used to treat single stones &le;2 cm in diameter was 2.1 percent for kidney and upper ureteral stones and 2.5 percent for middle and lower ureteral stones at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incidence of ureteral obstruction varies with the type of machine and the number of shocks. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159459607\"><span class=\"h2\">Parenchymal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The shock waves can reversibly damage all parenchymal components, particularly the blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. The degree of injury is related to the number of shocks, the level of energy delivered, and, in experimental models, the size of the kidney, with smaller kidneys being at greater risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These changes are often asymptomatic, but subcapsular or perinephric hemorrhage with ipsilateral pain can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. A perinephric hematoma can lead to modest and reversible elevations in serum creatinine, although more severe injuries have been reported as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Other forms of parenchymal injury following ESWL include damage to renal tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>] and glomeruli. The potential long-term implications of tubular injury are unclear, but some data suggest that acidification defects may develop, which can promote calcium phosphate stone formation. In 1201 patients with calcium kidney stones, higher number of ESWL treatments was associated with higher fraction of kidney stone calcium phosphate, after adjustment for age, sex, number of stones, and years of stone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Finally, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is a rare complication of ESWL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6667956\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on GFR and renal plasma flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In view of the risk of parenchymal injury, there has been concern that overall renal function as estimated from the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) might be impaired. An initial prospective study of 16 patients who underwent ESWL in 1984 found that, at 18 month follow-up, four had more than a 10 percent reduction in renal plasma flow (range 12 to 28 percent), an effect that persisted at four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, later studies did not confirm these findings, perhaps due to technical improvements in ESWL, as illustrated by the following observations in adults, children, and patients with a solitary kidney:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effect of ESWL on the GFR in the involved and contralateral kidney was evaluated in a review of 100 consecutive patients who were treated with ESWL for unilateral, nonobstructing kidney stones; the patients had a normal urinary tract, no or controlled infection, and a normal serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The GFR was measured with a radioisotope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among the 84 patients with an unobstructed kidney after the procedure, the GFR in the involved kidney was similar to baseline at one week after the procedure at 53 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and significantly increased to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> at three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among the 16 patients who had an obstructed kidney one week after the procedure, the GFR in the involved kidney fell from 48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> at presentation to 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> at one month, but had returned to baseline at three months. There were no significant changes in GFR in the contralateral kidney. Similar findings were seen with effective renal plasma flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The authors concluded that ESWL has no direct short-term adverse effect on renal function. Post-ESWL obstruction markedly reduces renal function in the treated kidney and should be treated urgently. However, the urgency of treatment of post-ESWL obstruction depends upon the size and location of the obstructing stone fragment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of an adverse effect on GFR was also noted in a later prospective study of 100 children who underwent treatment of renal stones with a modern lithotriptor and radioisotopic measurement of GFR and DMSA scans of renal parenchyma before ESWL and six months after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Children with renal scarring due to prior surgery or vesicoureteral reflux were excluded. At six months, none of the patients had a statistically significant decline in GFR or renal parenchymal defects. Another study evaluated 70 children with mean age of 6.5 years at the time of ESWL for 5.2 years after the procedure and found no effects on either renal growth or the development of hypertension or diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar lack of deterioration of GFR was found in a report of 65 patients with a <strong>solitary kidney</strong> (approximately one-third congenital, two-thirds acquired) who underwent ESWL, either alone or combined with percutaneous nephrolithotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The median follow-up was four years and the outcome was the same in patients with a serum creatinine concentration less than or greater than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6667998\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible increase in blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have evaluated the effect of ESWL on blood pressure or the development of new hypertension at follow-up periods ranging from 90 days to 19 years. The data are conflicting as to whether ESWL is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/13,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18-21</a>] or is not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/3,17,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,22,23</a>] associated with a long-term increase in blood pressure. The following observations from some of the largest studies illustrate the range of findings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 578 patients who had undergone ESWL, 59 percent answered a questionnaire and the results compared to a cohort of patients matched for age, sex, and year of presentation who had nephrolithiasis that was treated without surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 19 years, hypertension was significantly more prevalent in the ESWL group (odds ratio 1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.10).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective cohort study evaluated 4782 patients with kidney stones who were not hypertensive at presentation and were followed for an average of nine years; 400 (8.4 percent) were treated with ESWL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. ESWL therapy was not associated with an increased risk of new-onset hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio 1.03). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7793363\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the widespread use of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for stone treatment in both children and adults, the literature delineating the potential long-term deleterious effects on the renal parenchyma remains limited. Various studies in children are reassuring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], but similar long-term studies in adults must be undertaken. The risk of long-term complications such as hypertension and possibly diabetes mellitus have been raised but not consistently seen. Further studies that are long term, prospective, and ideally randomized should be carried out to clarify these issues.</p><p>Given the reduced hospitalization time and general safety of the procedure, there are insufficient data available to warrant discouraging clinicians and patients from choosing ESWL as an initial therapy when stone removal is clinically indicated and the nature and the site of the kidney stone are amenable to ESWL treatment. However, repeated ESWL for the same stone is unlikely to be successful; failure of the first treatment should prompt consideration of alternate urologic intervention. Prevention of new stone formation should be a priority after the procedure.
