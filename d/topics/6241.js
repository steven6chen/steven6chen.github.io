The etiology, epidemiology, and progression of CKD in children will be reviewed here. The clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of CKD in children are discussed separately.

Based on this broad definition, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease revised the 2002 classification of pediatric CKD by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guideline for Chronic Kidney Disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The KDIGO classification includes etiology, renal function based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and the presence and rate of urinary albumin excretion. It is the standard nomenclature used in clinical practice, research, and public health in the care of children with CKD and will be used throughout this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1031686965\"><span class=\"h2\">KDIGO pediatric definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The KDIGO diagnosis of pediatric CKD is based on fulfilling <strong>one</strong> of the following clinical criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GFR of less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for greater than three months with implications for health regardless of whether other CKD markers are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GFR greater than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> that is accompanied by evidence of structural damage or other markers of kidney function abnormalities including proteinuria, albuminuria, renal tubular disorders, or pathologic abnormalities detected by histology or inferred by imaging.

Staging is based on the cause of the disease (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> below), GFR, and the presence and rate of urinary albumin excretion. Risk stratification guides the intensity of monitoring and management for comorbid conditions associated with CKD.

GFR increases with maturation from infancy and approaches the adult mean value by two years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116099 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. As a result, the above classification is not applicable to children less than two years of age because their GFR is normally lower than the values of GFR of older patients and would incorrectly place them in a stage of disease characterized by greater renal impairment than their actual renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, a six-month-old infant with normal kidney function would be incorrectly classified as having GFR category G2 disease, because the mean GFR for this age is normally below 89 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Although the above schema cannot be used, an estimated GFR based upon serum creatinine can be compared with normative age-appropriate values to detect renal impairment in toddlers and infants with CKD. An age-specific GFR value between one and two standard deviations (SD) below the mean is considered a moderate reduction in GFR. Values that are more than two SD below the mean are classified as a severe reduction in GFR. The KDIGO guideline suggests that a GFR value more than one SD below the mean should raise concern and prompt more intensive monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3545389317\"><span class=\"h3\">Albuminuria and proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The KDIGO guidelines recommend adding albuminuria categories expressed as a ratio of urinary albumin to creatinine excretion to the staging of pediatric CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A1 &ndash; Normal to mildly increased (&lt;30mg <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/gram</span> creatinine)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A2 &ndash; Moderately increased (30 to 300mg <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/gram</span> creatinine)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A3 &ndash; Severely increased (&gt;300mg <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/gram</span> creatinine)</p><p/><p>The rationale for this addition is based on data that the level of albuminuria is predictive of mortality and kidney outcomes in adults with CKD. Although similar direct data in children are lacking, there is good evidence that the presence and severity of proteinuria (as measured by urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio) are predictive of declining renal function in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] and that urinary albumin excretion has a similar ability as urine protein-to-creatinine ratios to predict CKD progression in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Further study is needed to determine the pediatric-specific outcomes using both CKD stage and levels of proteinuria and albuminuria. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Progression of chronic kidney disease'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H27259169\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Albuminuria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121902985\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal failure/ESRD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term renal (kidney) failure refers to stage G5, a GFR below 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. At this level of kidney function, a patient is generally referred for renal replacement therapy (RRT) (dialysis or renal transplantation). Patients with CKD stage 5 are also characterized as having end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). These terms refer to a state of permanent loss of kidney function generally requiring long-term dialysis or kidney transplant to sustain life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99304709\"><span class=\"h2\">Glomerular filtration rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The GFR is equal to the sum of the filtration rates in all of the functioning nephrons. Thus, GFR provides an approximation of the number of functioning nephrons. A reduction in GFR implies a decrease in the number of functioning nephrons due to underlying <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/injury,</span> which may or may not be reversible.</p><p>Clinically, GFR is estimated from the urinary clearance of a filtration marker. The gold standard of filtration markers is inulin, a physiologically inert substance that is freely filtered at the glomerulus. Historically, using this exogenous agent requires a continuous intravenous infusion, multiple blood samples, and, at times, bladder catheterization. The GFR can also be determined via serum creatinine and a timed urine collection for creatinine clearance; however, the collection is often inconvenient for families and inaccurate due to missed samples, episodes of incontinence, or voiding problems. Hence, determination of GFR by timed urine collection can be time-consuming, costly, and difficult to perform for routine clinical care in children. Other methods include single-injection techniques for plasma disappearance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iohexol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">iohexol</a>, inulin, and other exogenous filtration markers.

Formulas based on serum creatinine are typically used in the clinical setting as it is a more accurate assessment of renal function than serum creatinine alone. </p><p>In children with CKD, the general formula used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) depends on the child's height, serum creatinine, and a constant &quot;k&quot; that is based on the creatinine assay used by the clinical laboratory performing the test (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-glomerular-filtration-rate-estimate-for-children-by-schwartz-formula\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;eGFR = k x height in cm <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> serum creatinine </p></div></div><p>The equation to estimate GFR in a child is dependent on the type of laboratory assay used for the determination of serum creatinine. If the serum creatinine is determined by Jaffe reaction, the Schwartz equation is used where the value of &quot;k&quot; is directly proportional to the muscle component of body, and varies with age, and in adolescents, with the sex of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. If the serum creatinine is determined by enzymatic reaction by isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), the simplified equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study should be used, where the value of &quot;k&quot; is equal to 0.413. However, the use of the formula using IDMS measurement is limited as it has only been validated for a range of GFR between 15 and 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Further work is needed to assess the accuracy of the latter equation in children with higher or normal levels of GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Data supporting the clinical utility of measuring cystatin C is limited in children and general recommendations for its use clinically cannot be made at this time. </p><p>In clinical research settings, equations utilizing both serum creatinine and cystatin C have been shown to be more accurate and precise compared with an eGFR using serum creatinine alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

These include patients with an unusual dietary intake (eg, vegetarian diet or creatinine supplements) or in those with decreased muscle mass (eg, amputation, malnutrition, or muscle wasting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The reported number of children with pediatric CKD is likely underestimated because earlier stages of CKD are usually asymptomatic and lead to underdiagnosis. Additionally, there may be underreporting due to inadequate health services in resource-limited areas. It is difficult to compare rates of childhood CKD throughout the world due to the variability of available health resources both for the care of children with CKD as well as for tracking and collecting accurate population-based data, and the use of different definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Furthermore, published information is often based on reports from major referral centers, and it is uncertain whether these data truly reflect population-based risks.</p><p>These limitations were noted in a review article that also provided the following population-based estimates of moderate to severe CKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Europe, an estimated median annual incidence of pediatric stage 3 to 5 CKD is 11.9 cases per million of age-related population (pmarp).

For some children, there is an ongoing progressive loss of function leading to CKD and in some cases to end-stage renal disease (ESRD); in others, there is recovery with little or no apparent sequelae. It is important to understand the factors associated with progression of CKD, in order to identify management strategies to prevent or slow the decline of kidney function to ESRD. Furthermore, it is essential to treat comorbid complications and to recognize the effect of CKD on growth and development and other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease. However, large knowledge gaps remain in understanding pediatric CKD progression, its effects, and optimal treatment approaches. Several multicenter pediatric CKD trials and cohort studies have been established to improve our understanding of pediatric CKD progression. The work of these research consortia has furthered our understanding of risk factors associated with higher rates of progression and have provided insights into potentially modifiable risk factors. The ongoing work of these groups will hopefully translate these discoveries into new therapeutic measures to slow or halt CKD progression.</p><p>It is thought that the progression of CKD is, in part, due to a final common mechanism of intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy. The increase in intraglomerular pressure results from systemic hypertension or via glomerular-specific processes, which contributes to increased filtration in the remaining functional nephrons and an increase in glomerular size. Over time, the increased transglomerular ultrafiltration and pressure leads to glomerular damage and leakage of protein resulting in interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. This is characterized histologically by glomerulosclerosis, vascular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, referred to as secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and clinically by proteinuria and loss of renal function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In children, several other factors, in addition to those that are commonly observed in adults with CKD (systemic hypertension and proteinuria) impact CKD progression:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal factors &ndash; The long-term effects on renal function need to be elucidated when renal injury occurs in the neonatal period. Prematurity and fetal growth restriction are both risk factors for CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth &ndash; The rate of CKD progression is usually greatest during the periods of rapid growth (infancy and puberty) when the sudden increase in body mass results in a rise in the filtration demands of the remaining nephrons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-in-children-definition-epidemiology-etiology-and-course/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As a result, children with CKD should be closely monitored during these two periods for an accelerated progression of CKD. In addition to the increase in body mass, hormonal changes during puberty may also contribute to the rapid decline in renal function seen in adolescence. It remains to be seen if effective interventions can be identified to modify the acceleration of CKD decline during these periods of rapid growth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Etiology &ndash; Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are a major cause of pediatric CKD.
