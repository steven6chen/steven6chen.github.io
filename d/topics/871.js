The severity of hematologic disease is related to the ability of the parasites to invade and grow in different red cell populations as well as the intrinsic growth rate of the parasite.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. vivax</em> and <em>P. ovale</em> have a strong preference to infect only young red cells (reticulocytes), thereby limiting parasitemia levels to approximately 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Anemia due to hemolysis does occur and may be severe, but there is no peripheral sequestration of parasitized red cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. malariae</em> invades red cells of all ages, but parasite multiplication during each cycle is relatively low.

These variant antigens enable late blood-stage infected red cells to sequester in post-capillary venules. Parasitemia is often high, occasionally exceeding 50 percent, and the potential for severe anemia, systemic disease, and death is considerable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>P. knowlesi</em> was originally described as a malarial infection of macaque monkeys. Morphologically it resembles <em>P. malariae</em> and it can cause significant and severe human infection, previously misdiagnosed as <em>P. malariae</em>, in Borneo, Malaysia, and in other areas of Southeast Asia. It has even been reported in travelers returning from those locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence of anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe malarial anemia (SMA) is seen most frequently in areas of very high malarial transmission and most commonly in young children and pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The prevalence of anemia, defined as a hematocrit &lt;33 percent, in malarial endemic areas of Africa varies between 31 and 91 percent in children, and between 60 and 80 percent in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In a typical study of children living a malarial endemic area in Uganda from 2015, the prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin &lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [&lt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L])</span> was over 60 percent in children less than five years old, and half of these children tested positive for malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In areas of high endemicity for malaria, the prevalence of anemia is the highest in the six-month-old to one year age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In epidemiologic studies it is difficult to determine the number of cases of severe anemia attributable to malaria as the World Health Organization definition of SMA is quite strict:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin concentration &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span> or hematocrit &lt;15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parasitemia with &gt;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/microL</span> of blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normocytic blood film (thus excluding thalassemia as well as iron, B12, and folate deficiencies)</p><p/><p>In individual cases, it may be difficult to attribute anemia to a single cause, although randomized placebo-controlled trials of malaria chemoprophylaxis and iron supplementation in infants have consistently shown that malaria infection was the main etiologic factor underlying anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Similarly, intermittent anti-malarial treatment in pregnant women can substantially reduce the prevalence of severe maternal anemia and use of an effective anti-malaria regime using artemisinin combination therapy in areas of high drug resistance to malaria may improve outcomes for women and reduce maternal anemia and low birthweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The precise etiology of anemia is often complex in endemic areas since nutritional deficiencies, genetic traits, and intercurrent infection may all contribute to the anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. It seems likely that etiology of SMA in endemic areas is likely to be multifactorial and variable in both time and place. This was illustrated in a case control study of severe anemia in hospitalized children in Malawi, in which severe anemia was associated with the following conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malarial infection (odds ratio [OR] 2.3; 95% CI 1.6-3.3)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV infection (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.0-3.8)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hookworm (OR, 4.8; 95% CI 2.0-12)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremia (OR 5.3; 95% CI 2.6-11)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G6PD deficiency (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.3-4.4)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deficiencies of vitamin A (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.3-5.8) and vitamin B12 (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.4-3.6).</p><p/><p>In this population, folate deficiency and sickle cell disease were uncommon. Iron deficiency was not prevalent and was negatively associated with bacteremia (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.22-0.60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In community surveys, young age and asymptomatic malaria infection are strong risk factors for anemia. The youngest children are at risk of iron deficiency anemia while in older children malaria and many other infections present a more complex, multifactorial etiological picture of anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Iron deficiency may be protective against malaria infection; it has been associated with reduced parasitemia, reduced incidence of severe malaria (38 percent decrease), and reduced all-cause mortality (60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, iron supplementation in endemic areas may increase malaria morbidity and mortality in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There is less concern for adverse effects of daily oral iron in pregnancy, and a 2015 systematic review concluded that iron supplementation may reduce the risk of maternal anemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy, possibly also reducing the incidence of low birthweight and preterm births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The incidence of malaria and severe malarial anemia has fallen in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa following widespread application of public health measures (eg, impregnated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, intermittent preventive treatment), with concomitant reductions in malaria-specific admission rates, use of blood transfusions, and malaria specific in-patient mortality of 50 percent or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FEATURES OF MALARIAL ANEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spectrum of the clinical presentation and severity of <em>P. falciparum</em> infection is broad. In endemic areas many malarial infections present in semi-immune and immune children and adults as an uncomplicated febrile illness. Fever develops with the release of merozoites from ruptured, infected red cells. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly (occasionally massive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]), hepatomegaly, and jaundice can develop, and splenic rupture can occasionally occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the clinical setting of SMA is varied and complex. Not only may acute infection present with anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebral malaria, respiratory distress and hypoglycemia, but chronic, repeated malarial infection may also lead to severe anemia. In either case, there may be a background of a low hemoglobin level due to the presence of other factors, as noted above, and malaria itself can predispose to bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe malarial anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>New malarial infections are often associated with a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration associated with increased hemolysis and bone marrow suppression. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Non-immune patients may exhibit a number of clinical syndromes including anemia, coma, respiratory distress, and hypoglycemia, and may have a high frequency of concurrent bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Children may present with mild, moderate or even severe anemia with or without other syndromes of severe disease (eg, malaise, fatigue, dyspnea, or respiratory distress as metabolic acidosis supervenes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/28,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30-32</a>].</p><p>The age distribution of the syndromes of severe disease is striking, but poorly understood. Children born in endemic areas are largely protected from severe malaria during the first six months of life by the passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulins and by the presence of fetal, rather than adult hemoglobin. Further discussion of how fetal hemoglobin is relatively resistant to digestion of malarial proteases and slows parasite growth can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protection against malaria in the hemoglobinopathies&quot;, section on 'Neonatal red cells and hemoglobin F'</a>.)</p><p>The presentation of disease changes from severe anemia in children aged between one and three years in areas of high transmission to cerebral malaria in older children in areas of lower transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As transmission intensity declines, severe malaria is most frequently found in older age groups.</p><p>There has been evidence of an increased incidence of anemia after malarial challenge in vaccine studies in non-human primates and also in field trials of blood stage vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The significance of these findings remains uncertain, but there appears to be an increase in clearance of uninfected red blood cells during blood-stage infection in vaccinated individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anemia is also present in those with chronic malarial infection. Many children may present with severe anemia and a blood smear negative for malaria parasites, but will respond to antimalarial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In an Indian series of children with chronic falciparum malaria, those with moderate to severe anemia and hepatosplenomegaly had a greater degree of hemolysis, neutropenia, atypical lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, but a lower level of parasitemia than patients with acute malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Reduced production, increased clearance of cells and hypersplenism may be responsible for the neutropenia and thrombocytopenia seen in such cases. It is now recognized that low levels of parasitemia in otherwise asymptomatic children may be associated with raised levels of hepcidin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. High hepcidin levels restrict iron absorption and also transfer of iron from bone marrow macrophages to developing red cells during chronic disease or inflammation and in malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>], and may therefore contribute to chronic anemia secondary to malaria infection.

Microcytosis and hypochromia may be present due to the very high frequency of thalassemia trait <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> iron deficiency in many, but not all, of the endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Blackwater fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Blackwater Fever&quot; (BWF) is an uncommon form of anemia in malaria characterized by intravascular hemolysis, sudden appearance of hemoglobin in the urine, and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and red cell fragmentation may accompany this presentation.</p><p>BWF may be difficult to correlate with malarial infection; parasitemia may not be detected due to synchronous lysis of all infected red cells. Cases series of BWF in Africa and Southeast Asia have noted an association between that sudden hemolysis and malarial infection, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>]. Among European expatriates living in Africa, BWF has been associated with use of the antimalarial agents halofantrine, quinine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefloquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefloquine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A causal association between BWF and quinine is supported by the virtual disappearance of BWF from Africa in the period leading up to 2010, following replacement of quinine with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>More recently, there has been a series of reports of BWF after treatment with artemisinin derivatives. Artemisinin derivatives were first reported to be associated with transient reticulocytopenia. However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artesunate-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artesunate</a> has also been associated with delayed-onset hemolytic anemia sometimes requiring transfusion. Prospective studies in Europe showed that delayed hemolysis is seen in 25 to 30 percent of travelers treated for malaria with intravenous artesunate and may be severe in up to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. There have been reports of similar intravascular hemolysis in children treated with artesunate-based therapies in regions of Africa including Ghana, Gabon, and Eastern Uganda [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Additional information about delayed hemolytic anemia following treatment with artemisinins is presented separately.

Possible mechanisms are oxidative stress, a primary autoimmune process, or drug-dependent autoantibodies. The relative contributions of these processes have not been systematically studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia in P. vivax malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most work describes the association of <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria with anemia, infection with P vivax can, on occasion, cause severe disease, including anemia and severe hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. <em>P. vivax</em> malaria has been clearly associated with anemia during pregnancy, along with low birth weight of the children of these infected mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Indeed, some studies in rural India suggest that severe disease is associated with <em>P. vivax</em> infection more frequently than with <em>P. falciparum</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Anemia has been associated with increased red cell clearance, reticulocytopenia, and dyserythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PARASITE LIFE CYCLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To understand the mechanism of hemolysis in malaria, it is helpful to briefly review the life-cycle of the malarial parasite. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The asexual life cycle begins when sporozoites from the saliva of a female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito taking a blood meal enter the circulation and invade hepatocytes. After one to two weeks, up to 10,000 merozoites are formed. Following rupture of the hepatocyte, infective merozoites are released into the circulation and invade red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Red cell entry occurs via binding of the malarial parasite to specific receptors on the red cell surface, including glycophorin A for <em>P. falciparum</em> and the Duffy blood group antigen for <em>P. vivax</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/16,17,61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,61-64</a>].

Mature schizonts burst to release merozoites which invade new red cells.</p><p>A small proportion of merozoites in red cells transform into male and female gametocytes which are ingested by the mosquito following a subsequent blood meal. Male and female gametes fuse and transform into an o&ouml;cyst which divides asexually into many sporozoites that migrate to the salivary gland of the infected mosquito, from which site they are released during the next blood meal.</p><p><em>P. falciparum</em> has additional unique characteristics that help to explain its distinct potential to cause severe or fatal disease. As <em>P. falciparum</em> parasites mature within red cells, they induce the formation of &quot;knobs&quot; on the surface of erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].

While some studies observe moderate increases in IL-12 and IL-18 in patients with severe anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/142,143\" class=\"abstract_t\">142,143</a>], others report decreases in IL-12 in patients with severe anemia (Hb &lt;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> compared with uncomplicated controls (Hb &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L),</span> or no significant increases in patients with severe disease compared with uncomplicated malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/144,145\" class=\"abstract_t\">144,145</a>].</p><p>The glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor for the merozoite proteins, MSP-1, MSP-2 and MSP-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>], the parasite product found in plasma during malaria infections, may be implicated in the pro-inflammatory cytokine effects on SMA. GPIs may induce the release of TNF-alpha from human macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>], which could contribute to the pathology of SMA. The pro-inflammatory response from human monocytes is through interaction of GPIs with TLR2, and TLR4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. Antibodies to GPIs are found in sera of adults from endemic regions in Kenya, but at reduced levels in children who, in general, have more severe disease and anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>].</p><p>The heme degradation product hemozoin may also be more intimately linked to an innate immune response, and thus pro-inflammatory cytokine release, than previously thought. In humans, some studies have shown that synthetic hemozoin pigment induces expression of TNF-alpha, which has been linked to the ability of hemozoin to induce the metalloproteinase MMP-9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/150-152\" class=\"abstract_t\">150-152</a>]. Data from murine models of malaria have suggested that hemozoin stimulates an innate pro-inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>] via a MyD88-dependent TLR9 pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. It now appears that stimulation of TLR9 may be through DNA associated with hemozoin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered iron metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired utilization and recycling of iron may contribute to the severity of disease in children presenting with SMA, which shares many similarities with the anemia of (chronic) inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. The peptide hormone hepcidin has been implicated in mediating the anemia of chronic inflammation by reducing the availability of iron stores for erythropoiesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;, section on 'Hepcidin'</a>.)</p><p>Hepcidin is regulated by pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor and IL-6 which are elevated in both murine infections and in patients presenting with severe falciparum malaria, although other parasite-derived and host factors may be involved in stimulating hepcidin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/37-39,145,155-157\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39,145,155-157</a>]. Hepcidin levels fall in the most severely ill children as hypoxia inhibits hepcidin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. High hepcidin levels stimulated by blood stage malaria infection are associated with inhibition of liver stage malaria infection in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>] and reduced incorporation of iron into red cells in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Evidence from murine malaria suggests that low serum iron caused by elevated hepcidin reduced parasite growth and progression to severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. These experimental and clinical findings are consistent with a role for iron as a growth factor for malaria parasites and a role for raised hepcidin and reduction in available iron as a protective innate response to malaria infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6112693\"><span class=\"h3\">Concomitant iron deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been considerable interest in the relationship between iron deficiency and malaria and the question of whether to treat iron deficiency if it coexists with malaria. This is an important issue for the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron deficiency is widespread across malaria-endemic areas and is particularly common among children &lt;5 years of age, who are most vulnerable to malaria. A trial in Tanzania demonstrated excess morbidity and mortality among children under five who received iron supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low serum iron may reduce growth of the malaria parasite <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce the progression to severe disease. In a study including 727 Malawian children, baseline iron deficiency was correlated with a significantly lower incidence of parasitemia (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41-0.74) and clinical malaria (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.33-0.73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>].</p><p/><p>The complex links between iron metabolism, iron deficiency, and malaria infection and lack of a simple, effective, and inexpensive point-of-care test to identify those who would benefit from iron supplementation have precluded community-wide iron supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/163,164\" class=\"abstract_t\">163,164</a>]. Determining the need for iron supplementation depends on individual clinical circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>When not to treat</strong> &mdash; Oral iron given during active malaria infection is not efficiently absorbed because hepcidin, which reduces iron absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, is present at high levels during malaria infection. In addition, administered iron may cause gastrointestinal inflammation, cause oxidative stress and tissue damage, and act as a growth factor for parasites, bacteria, and viruses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>When to treat</strong> &mdash; Oral iron administered after clearance of parasitemia is absorbed efficiently because hepcidin levels are low after clearance of infection and at the end of the malaria season. Iron supplementation is appropriate in the absence of other infection and if iron stores are low, as evidenced by low serum ferritin level. Serum hepcidin levels may be a useful indicator for whether iron supplementation is needed, as well as when iron may be efficiently absorbed, although this test remains a research tool at present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythropoietin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fall in circulating hemoglobin levels and subsequent tissue hypoxia should normally stimulate elevated levels of erythropoietin (Epo). However, the clinical evidence for appropriately raised levels of Epo in SMA is somewhat contradictory. Studies in adults from Thailand and Sudan have suggested that Epo concentrations, although raised, were inappropriately low for the degree of anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/166,167\" class=\"abstract_t\">166,167</a>]. However, several studies of malaria in African children suffering from SMA have shown appropriately raised Epo concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/42,168-170\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,168-170</a>]. In fact, Epo levels in SMA are more than threefold higher when compared with anemic children without malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p>Experimental evidence in murine malaria suggests that exogenous Epo can downregulate inflammatory responses induced by T cells and myeloid cells, reduced endothelial activation and improved integrity of the blood-brain barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/171,172\" class=\"abstract_t\">171,172</a>].</p><p>Although ineffective or inadequate Epo synthesis may contribute to SMA in some settings, in African children with malaria Epo synthesis is elevated more than expected. It is more likely that a reduced response to Epo, as seen in the anemia of chronic inflammation, and not an inappropriately low level of Epo, is the more significant contribution to pathology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826156\"><span class=\"h2\">Deficiencies of folate and vitamin B12</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although dietary deficiencies are widespread in malarial endemic regions, the influence of reduced folate levels are not thought to be major contributors to the dyserythropoiesis seen during SMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. The finding of low vitamin B12 levels in malaria suggests that subclinical deficiency of B12 may play a hitherto unrecognized contribution to severe anemia or may reflect altered vitamin B12 metabolism or transport during infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT ON PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Falciparum malaria in pregnancy is more likely to be severe and complicated as the placenta contains high levels of parasites. The diagnosis of malaria can be difficult if parasites are concentrated in the placenta and scanty in the blood.</p><p>Pregnant women may experience a variety of adverse consequences from malarial infection. These include maternal anemia, placental accumulation of parasites via attachment to chondroitin sulfate A in the placental intervillous space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>], low birth weight from prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation, fetal parasite exposure and congenital infection, and increased infant mortality. It has been estimated that 75,000 to 200,000 infant deaths are associated with malarial infection in pregnancy each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>].</p><p>Imported cases of malaria in pregnancy may present with severe anemia, and the somewhat heterogeneous case series suggest that these infections not infrequently lead to spontaneous abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>].</p><p>In one study, high levels of maternal IgG antibodies against a variant surface antigen (VSA) expressed on pregnancy-associated <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria (PAM)-infected red cells protected against low birth weight and maternal anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-malaria/abstract/176\" class=\"abstract_t\">176</a>].
