Clinical trials have found mixed results for devotional meditation compared with control conditions. </p><p>As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 36 college-age students to devotional meditation training, progressive muscle relaxation, or a no-treatment control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-physical-cognitive-and-spiritual-interventions/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

Special attention is given to posture, breath, and the space one occupies. Similar to mindfulness meditation, the goal of centering prayer is not to empty the mind, but rather to exercise a willingness to let thoughts come and go, while using a sacred word as a refocusing tool. Centering prayer differs from secular forms of meditation because the emphasis is on &quot;intention&quot; (a shared experience with God&rsquo;s presence) rather than attention or concentration. </p><p>Uncontrolled trials found several weeks of daily centering prayer to be associated with decreased anxiety in small samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-treatments-for-anxiety-symptoms-and-disorders-physical-cognitive-and-spiritual-interventions/abstract/90,96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,96-98</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5472412\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixty-two percent of adults in the United States utilize some form of complementary and alternative medical treatments; the most commonly used are mind-body therapies. Individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric illness may be more likely to use these therapies compared with the general population, especially patients with anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H5265086\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yoga, a practice of breathing, mindfulness, spirituality, and body, has been shown in multiple clinical trials to reduce anxiety in practitioners compared with non-practitioners. Its effects compared with stretching and other physical exercise is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H5470617\" class=\"local\">'Yoga'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tai chi is a form of mind-body exercise that originated in China and involves martial arts, meditation, and dance-like movements that focus on the mind and body connection. A meta-analysis concluded that tai chi reduced anxiety in trial participants compared with active and inactive controls. (See <a href=\"#H5470952\" class=\"local\">'Tai chi'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine physical exercise is recommended for all adults by the US Department of Health and Human Services, among other groups, citing research findings of its beneficial health effects. (See <a href=\"#H5471155\" class=\"local\">'Physical exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mindfulness meditation has been defined as paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally. Basic elements include self-regulation of attention and taking a nonjudgmental stance towards one&rsquo;s experience. A meta-analysis of 47 trials with 3515 participants found that mindfulness meditation programs had moderate evidence of reducing anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H30700436\" class=\"local\">'Mindfulness meditation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transcendental meditation and qigong meditation are forms of spiritual meditation that have been shown in clinical trials to reduce anxiety. There are fewer clinical trials of devotional meditation and anxiety; study of centering prayer and anxiety is limited to case <span class=\"nowrap\">reports/series</span>. (See <a href=\"#H5472438\" class=\"local\">'Spiritual meditation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of efficacy for the interventions above has significant methodologic limitations. Further clinical trials are needed with larger sample sizes, more appropriate control groups, standardized interventions, and participants with higher levels of anxiety and diagnosed anxiety disorders at enrollment. (See <a href=\"#H5265086\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We are generally supportive of the physical, meditative, and <span class=\"nowrap\">spiritual/religious</span> activities described in this topic. They may be helpful and are unlikely to be harmful. We would not encourage their use as a substitute for psychiatric treatment for anxiety disorders, because evidence of their efficacy is generally much weaker. These activities may be of use as adjunctive treatments or primary treatments in patients with relatively low anxiety (eg, beneath the diagnostic threshold of anxiety disorder diagnoses).
