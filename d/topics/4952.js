There are four dengue virus (DENV) types (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), all of which are capable of inducing severe disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever <span class=\"nowrap\">[DHF]/dengue</span> shock syndrome [DSS]). Dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries in tropical and subtropical regions and causes an estimated 390 million infections annually worldwide, of which 96 million are clinically apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The likelihood for development of severe dengue is highest among individuals who are infected a second time by a different DENV type from the first infection (known as secondary or heterotypic infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, severe disease occurs primarily among individuals in areas where multiple serotypes circulate simultaneously. Infection with DENV provides long-term protection against disease caused by reinfection with that particular type, supporting the feasibility of developing an effective vaccine. However, infection provides only short-lived cross-protection to the other three DENV types.</p><p>There are numerous documents providing guidance on the optimal approaches to managing dengue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Data from well-designed randomized controlled trials are limited. The guidance in this document largely agrees with published guidelines and is also based on the contributors' clinical experience in management of complex DENV infections.</p><p>Measures to prevent DENV infection and supportive treatment following infection and the development of disease will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dengue-virus-infection-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dengue virus infection: Epidemiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dengue-virus-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dengue virus infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dengue virus (DENV) transmission occurs when susceptible hosts, DENVs, and mosquitoes capable of transmission are co-located in space and time. Infection risk exists for anyone living in or traveling in a dengue-endemic region, especially in tropical Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. In most of these regions, DENV transmission occurs year-round. However, the greatest risk of infection tends to be seasonal or during a recognized outbreak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Endemic areas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approaches for the prevention of DENV infection and disease in endemic areas include mosquito control, personal protective measures, and vaccination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Mosquito control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mosquito control is effective but is difficult to resource and sustain. Approaches to mosquito control for prevention of DENV infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing breeding sites &ndash; Community-based education to reduce breeding sites that accumulate standing water (such as discarded tires and other containers) have shown some promise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Larva control &ndash; Seeding water vessels with copepods that feed on mosquito larvae was successful in eliminating <em>A. aegypti </em>and dengue transmission in one study including 32 rural communities in Vietnam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], although this strategy is difficult to apply in urban areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of insecticide &ndash; Distribution of insecticide-treated curtains was successful in reducing populations of <em>A. aegypti</em> mosquitoes for up to 18 months in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] and was associated with reduced human and mosquito infections with DENV in one region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], although use of the curtains declined with time. Insecticide spraying in response to dengue outbreaks is not highly effective, since <em>A. aegypti</em> mosquitoes frequently breed inside houses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endosymbiotic control &ndash; A novel strategy consists of releasing mosquitoes infected with the intracellular endosymbiotic bacterium <em>Wolbachia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Such mosquitoes could reduce DENV transmission via several mechanisms, including reducing mosquito lifespan and inhibiting viral replication; these effects could be propagated into later generations of mosquitoes via ongoing transmission of <em>Wolbachia</em>.</p><p/><p>Programs in the 1940s through 1970s targeting the <em>A. aegypti</em> mosquito via aggressive surveillance and insecticide use for elimination of urban yellow fever in the Americas were successful at reducing transmission of yellow fever as well as the DENVs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Lack of funding and attention for these programs led to reemergence of <em>A. aegypti</em> and corresponding reemergence of dengue.</p><p>Issues related to mosquito vector control are discussed further separately.

Following infection with one type, there is short-lived immunity and cross-protection against disease caused by the other three DENV types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In view of the association between previous exposure to DENV types and severe disease and the recognition that all four DENV types are capable of causing severe disease, ideally any candidate vaccine should produce protective immunity against all four DENV types (tetravalent immunity). Since waning immunity might also increase the risk for severe disease in vaccine recipients, vaccine-induced protective immunity should be long lived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Given that rate of clinically relevant third or fourth DENV infection is low, it is unclear whether tetravalent immunity is required for efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A number of dengue vaccine candidates are in development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. One vaccine, CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia), has been licensed in several countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia (but not in the United States) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. CYD-TDV should be administered only to individuals with history of previous dengue virus infection or laboratory evidence of previous dengue virus infection.</p><p>CYD-TDV is a formulation of four chimeric yellow fever 17D-dengue vaccine viruses, where the premembrane and envelope proteins from each of the four DENV types replaces the same proteins in a yellow fever 17D backbone virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The basis for licensure was two large phase III randomized controlled trials of CYD-TDV; results were reported in 2014 to 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. One trial was conducted in five countries in the Asia-Pacific region and enrolled children aged 2 to 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; the other trial was conducted in five countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and enrolled children aged 9 to 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The age groups were chosen based on likely target populations for vaccination and epidemiologic data of clinical attack rates.</p><p>In both trials, the CYD-TDV vaccine was administered in three doses at months 0, 6, and 12. Results from the two trials were comparable; in the primary per-protocol analysis, vaccine efficacy was 57 and 61 percent against virologically confirmed dengue of any severity caused by any DENV type that occurred between 28 days and 13 months after the third vaccine dose. Vaccine efficacy was higher against dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue infection requiring hospitalization (80 to 95 percent). Vaccine efficacy varied by serotype and was significantly higher for DENV-3 and DENV-4 (approximately 75 percent) than DENV-1 (50 percent) and DENV-2 (35 to 42 percent). Vaccine efficacy was lower (34 to 36 percent) in children 2 to 5 years of age and in children who did not have detectable dengue-neutralizing antibodies prior to vaccination. The safety profile was considered good, and there was no indication of more severe dengue disease in breakthrough cases in vaccine recipients that occurred over the 25 months of active case surveillance.</p><p>Follow-up analyses of these vaccine trials have confirmed limitations of the vaccine and a safety signal in individuals who did have evidence of a previous dengue virus infection prior to vaccination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An interim analysis published in 2015 noted that the vaccine was associated with an elevated relative risk for dengue infection requiring hospitalization during the third year of the trial (between one and two years after the last dose of the vaccine) among children younger than nine years and particularly in children two to five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The elevated risk has declined over successive years of follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis including 3736 study participants, 443 had asymptomatic dengue infection (67 had virologically confirmed asymptomatic infection and 376 had serologically confirmed infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic dengue infection was 33 percent overall (38 among recipients &ge;9 years of age and 9 percent among recipients 2 to 9 years of age).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In November 2017, the vaccine manufacturer announced that, based on six years of clinical data, the vaccine had a persistent beneficial effect in individuals who had been previously infected with dengue prior to vaccination. In individuals with no prior episode of dengue virus infection, however, vaccination was associated with an increased risk of severe disease and hospitalization. Therefore, the manufacturer updated the label, advising that individuals with no prior dengue virus infection forgo vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In December 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement indicating that the vaccine is protective against severe dengue for individuals with dengue seropositivity at the time of first vaccination, but that the risk of severe dengue is significantly increased for individuals with dengue seronegativity at the time of first vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p>The reason for the increased risk of severe dengue in seronegative individuals is uncertain. Only a limited number of individuals underwent scheduled serologic monitoring prior to and following vaccination, so analysis of the immune profiles associated with various outcomes is not possible on a meaningful scale.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Travelers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary approach to prevention of dengue virus infections in travelers consists of avoiding exposure to infected <em>A. aegypti</em> mosquitoes, which predominantly live in urban areas (in and around houses) and are most active during the daytime as well as at twilight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Remaining in well-screened or air-conditioned buildings during the day can reduce the risk of exposure. When outside during the day, individuals should wear clothing that reduces the amount of exposed skin and should use an effective mosquito repellent, such as N,N-diethyl-metatoluamide (DEET). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-arthropod-and-insect-bites-repellents-and-other-measures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of arthropod and insect bites: Repellents and other measures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most travelers from nonendemic countries are at exceedingly low risk for severe dengue in the absence of prior dengue virus exposure; potential exceptions include frequent international travelers, expatriates, frequently deploying military personnel, and immigrants from endemic areas returning to their countries of origin.</p><p>People with history of dengue infection need not avoid subsequent travel to dengue-endemic regions. Severe dengue occurs in a small number of secondary infections (2 to 4 percent), so the risk of severe dengue in travelers is very low.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no direct antiviral therapy available against the dengue viruses (DENVs). Management is supportive, which largely consists of maintaining adequate intravascular volume.</p><p>Treatment guidelines have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO; 2009) and the WHO South-East Asia Regional Office (SEARO; 2011); there are variations between these guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. These are discussed in the following sections, which follow the framework of the revised dengue case classification. Where relevant, significant differences in the recommendations are noted in the discussion below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dengue-virus-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dengue virus infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus far, there has been no prospective validation of the approaches summarized in the WHO guidelines. The areas of greatest uncertainty are the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria used for hospitalization and for initiation of fluid therapy. Some additional clinical approaches that have been successful in endemic areas are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H13085392\" class=\"local\">'Additional approaches to management'</a> below.)</p><p>A definitive laboratory diagnosis of dengue is often not available at the point of care; therefore, it is also important to consider other treatable diagnoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dengue-virus-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H4157314730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dengue virus infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13084971\"><span class=\"h2\">Phases of infection and clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dengue virus infection has three phases: a febrile phase, a critical (plasma leakage) phase, and a convalescent (reabsorption) phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The febrile phase is characterized by a sudden high-grade fever and dehydration typically lasting two to seven days. The critical phase is characterized by plasma leakage, bleeding, shock, and organ impairment; it usually starts around the time of defervescence (typically days 3 to 7 of infection) and lasts for 24 to 48 hours. The convalescent phase may be characterized by fatigue that can last for days to weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dengue-virus-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2508477551\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dengue virus infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Phases of infection'</a>.)</p><p>The WHO classification schemes for dengue virus infection are summarized separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>].

Early recognition of progression to severe disease and patients at increased risk for severe disease is essential, with prompt initiation of more aggressive therapy when necessary.</p><p>Outpatient management is appropriate for patients with presumptive diagnosis of dengue infection in the absence of warning signs or coexisting conditions (pregnancy, infancy, old age, diabetes, renal failure, underlying hemolytic disease, obesity, or poor social situation); such patients should be able to tolerate oral fluids, urinate at least once every six hours, and have near normal blood counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Inpatient management is warranted for patients with dengue and warning signs of severe infection, severe dengue infection, or dengue infection with coexisting conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109849\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109849 \">algorithm 1</a>). Dramatic plasma leakage can develop suddenly; early identification of patients at increased risk for shock and other complications is critical. The period of maximum risk for shock is between the third and seventh day of illness, which typically coincides with resolution of fever. In general, plasma leakage first becomes evident between 24 hours before and 24 hours after defervescence.</p><p>Laboratory abnormalities include derangements in blood counts and liver function tests. An elevated hematocrit is an indication that plasma leakage has already occurred and that fluid repletion is required. Confounding factors should be considered when interpreting the hematocrit, including dehydration (associated with increased hematocrit) and hemorrhage (associated with reduced hematocrit). Marked thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">(&le;100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> is a criteria for dengue hemorrhagic fever and usually precedes overt plasma leakage. Mild elevations in serum transaminases are common in the setting of dengue infection; transaminase levels are significantly elevated in patients with DHF. In addition, elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) levels are common relatively early in the course of illness; in one Thai study, a normal AST level was a strong negative predictor of DHF (negative predictive value 0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Most patients with dengue do not develop severe illness and can be safely managed in the outpatient setting. (See <a href=\"#H13084971\" class=\"local\">'Phases of infection and clinical assessment'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients should be instructed regarding the warning signs of severe dengue infection and the critical phase that follows defervescence (which lasts for 24 to 48 hours); during this period, patients may deteriorate rapidly. During the febrile phase (lasting two to seven days) and the subsequent critical phase (lasting one to two days), the patient should be evaluated daily from the third day of illness through the end of the critical phase for signs of dehydration and other warning signs of severe dengue. Serial blood counts should be followed to evaluate for interval increases in hematocrit concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count, indicating presence of plasma leakage and increased risk of bleeding complications.</p><p>Fever may be controlled with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin-based products should not be used out of concern for their effect on platelet function and the potential increased risk for bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Management of fever'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients should be instructed to take plenty of fluids and watch for signs of dehydration (decrease in urination, few or no tears, dry mouth or lips, sunken eyes, listlessness or confusion, cold or clammy extremities, sunken fontanel in an infant); these findings warrant prompt clinical evaluation. As fever declines (three to eight days after onset of symptoms), patients should be instructed to seek prompt attention for any of the following: severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, skin rash, bleeding from nose or gums, vomiting blood, dark stools, drowsiness or irritability, pale or cool skin, and difficulty breathing.</p><p>Patients in endemic areas should take measures to prevent dengue virus transmission. If possible, all mosquitoes in the house should be eliminated, screens should be placed on windows and doors to prevent mosquitoes from coming into the house, and containers holding standing water should be emptied. To avoid infecting mosquitoes (which can in turn infect others in the household), if possible the patient should sleep under a bed net and use insect repellant while ill.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3395080\"><span class=\"h3\">Inpatient management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inpatient management is warranted for patients with dengue and warning signs of severe infection, severe dengue infection, or dengue infection with coexisting conditions (pregnancy, infancy, diabetes, poor social situation, old age, or renal failure).

There are a number of acceptable approaches to management of shock associated with dengue, and there are no clinical trial data favoring one approach over the other. The process of frequent clinical assessment is critical to ensure judicious fluid resuscitation and detection of hemorrhage if present.</p><p>Initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid is appropriate; there is no clinical advantage of colloid over crystalloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. In one randomized trial including 512 Vietnamese children with moderate dengue shock syndrome, outcomes were similar with Ringer's lactate, 6% dextran 70, and 6% hydroxyethyl starch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], establishing that Ringer's lactate is a safe, effective, and inexpensive crystalloid solution for initial resuscitation of patients with moderate shock. In patients with severe shock, dextran and starch performed similarly, although dextran was associated with more hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p>Intravenous colloid solution is warranted for patients with intractable shock resistant to crystalloid resuscitation; in such cases, we favor 10% dextran 40 in normal saline. Patients with persistent hypoperfusion and falling hematocrit require blood transfusion and should be evaluated for occult or overt bleeding. Other possible complications (such as acidosis, hypoglycemia, and hypocalcemia) should be investigated and corrected as needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypovolemic shock in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once hemodynamic stability has been restored, intravenous fluids should be continued with gradual reduction of the infusion rate over the next 24 to 48 hours. There have been no controlled comparisons of infusion regimens; we typically reduce the infusion rate as follows: 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over the first hour, then 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for 1 to 2 hours, 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for 4 to 6 hours, and 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for 6 to 12 hours. This gradual reduction is intended to minimize the risk of recurrent shock and volume overload. The patient's clinical status (including vital signs, urine output, and hematocrit) should be evaluated prior to each infusion rate adjustment.</p><p>Close clinical observation is essential even after restoration of normovolemia; the 24 hours following initial resuscitation is a period of increased vascular permeability, and patients can develop recurrent shock during this period. Fluid lost into potential spaces (pleura, peritoneum) during the period of plasma leakage is reabsorbed rapidly. Therefore, intravenous fluid supplementation should be discontinued following the period of increased vascular permeability; excessive fluid administration after this point can precipitate hypervolemia and pulmonary edema.</p><p>In the absence of complications from prolonged hypotension, most patients with severe dengue infection recover within a few days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dengue-virus-infection-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Discharge from the hospital is appropriate when patients have been afebrile for at least 24 hours or have passed two days after an episode of shock, are clinically well, and have normal appetite, urine output, and hematocrit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88969804\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal bleeding, epistaxis, or menorrhagia may be severe enough to warrant blood transfusion. Significant internal bleeding should be suspected in patients with signs of intravascular hypovolemia without elevation of hematocrit. In these circumstances, blood transfusion should be performed (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of packed red blood cells or 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> whole blood in children; 1 unit of packed red blood cells or whole blood in adults). The clinical response and posttransfusion hematocrit should be monitored.

The likelihood for development of severe dengue is highest among individuals who develop a second dengue infection caused by a different virus type from the first infection. Thus, severe disease occurs primarily among individuals in areas where multiple serotypes circulate simultaneously. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approaches for prevention of dengue infection in endemic areas include mosquito control and vaccine development. Mosquito control is effective but is difficult to sustain. The vaccine that is most advanced in development is CYD-TDV, a formulation of four chimeric yellow fever 17D-dengue vaccine viruses. It has been licensed in several countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia (but not the United States). CYD-TDV should be administered only to individuals with history of previous dengue virus infection or laboratory evidence of previous dengue virus infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Endemic areas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most travelers from nonendemic countries are at low risk for severe dengue in the absence of prior dengue virus exposure; potential exceptions include frequent international travelers, expatriates, frequently deploying military personnel, and immigrants from endemic areas returning to their countries of origin. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Travelers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected dengue should be assessed carefully and directed to the appropriate care setting. Early recognition of severe disease and patients at increased risk for severe disease are essential, with prompt initiation of more aggressive therapy when necessary. (See <a href=\"#H13084971\" class=\"local\">'Phases of infection and clinical assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outpatient management is appropriate for patients with presumptive diagnosis of dengue in the absence of warning signs or coexisting condition (pregnancy, infancy, old age, diabetes, renal failure, underlying hemolytic disease, obesity, or poor social situation). Patients should be instructed to take plenty of fluids and watch for signs of dehydration. Inpatient management is warranted for patients with dengue and warning signs of severe infection, severe dengue infection, or dengue infection with coexisting conditions. (See <a href=\"#H3395051\" class=\"local\">'Outpatient management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3395080\" class=\"local\">'Inpatient management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients warranting inpatient management should be assessed for signs of shock (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109848 \">table 1</a>).
