Primary infection with VZV results in varicella, also known as chickenpox, characterized by vesicular lesions in different stages of development on the face, trunk, and extremities. Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, results from reactivation of endogenous latent VZV infection within the sensory ganglia. This clinical form of the disease is characterized by a painful, unilateral vesicular eruption, which usually occurs in a restricted dermatomal distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-herpes-zoster-in-the-immunocompetent-host/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although herpes zoster can occur at any age, it is mainly a disease of adults &gt;60 years of age. </p><p>The treatment of herpes zoster will be reviewed here.

As an example, there are no definitive data to suggest that tricyclic antidepressants in patients with herpes zoster prevent PHN from developing, and the risk of adverse events with tricyclic antidepressants is increased in elderly patients.
