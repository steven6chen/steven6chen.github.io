Cholestasis results from diminished bile formation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excretion, which can be caused by a number of disorders. Neonatal cholestasis lasting more than two weeks affects approximately 1 in 2500 births (excluding infants with intestinal failure-associated liver disease), but estimates vary depending on the definition used to define cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic review provides an approach to patients with neonatal cholestasis. The pathogenesis and management of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and common causes of neonatal cholestasis are discussed separately.

The biochemical features of cholestasis reflect the retention of components of bile in the serum (eg, bilirubin, bile acids, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cholesterol). The pattern and severity of each of these abnormalities varies with the underlying disorder. Elevated conjugated bilirubin is the predominant characteristic in most of the causes of neonatal cholestasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia &ndash; </strong>The terms &quot;conjugated bilirubin&quot; and &quot;direct bilirubin&quot; are often used interchangeably because conjugated bilirubin can be estimated by the &quot;direct&quot; reaction with a diazo reagent (van den Bergh reaction). However, direct-reacting bilirubin includes both the conjugated bilirubin and the delta fraction, which represents bilirubin covalently bound to albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

If conjugated bilirubin is measured, the upper limit of normal is about 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. An elevation above these levels is an abnormal finding and requires additional evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The threshold is somewhat higher, usually a serum direct bilirubin greater than 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (34.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> for defining clinically significant hyperbilirubinemia in infants with intestinal failure-associated liver disease (which is also known as parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neonatal cholestasis</strong> &ndash; The term &quot;neonatal cholestasis&quot; is often used to refer to cholestatic liver disease that is present at birth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> develops within the first few months of life, rather than referring strictly to the neonatal period (the first 28 days of life). In clinical practice, these disorders usually become apparent within the first three months of life, which is the critical period for identifying infants with biliary atresia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64995 \">table 1</a>). However, similar diagnostic considerations apply for infants whose cholestasis is identified after three months of age. Although the cholestasis caused by these disorders is persistent, infants should be evaluated as soon as the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is identified, to avoid delay in diagnosis. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any infant noted to be jaundiced at the two-week well child visit should be evaluated for cholestasis (ie, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This is because physiologic jaundice (characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) resolves by 14 days of age in at least 85 percent of infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Although most infants who are still jaundiced at two weeks of age have benign causes (breastfeeding, breast milk, or hemolytic jaundice), a few will have biliary atresia or other diseases that require prompt diagnosis and treatment to optimize outcomes. Initiating evaluation at the two-week visit is important because some of these infants may not have another health care visit until they are two months old. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and etiology of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-atresia#H19842428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary atresia&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.) </p><p>This approach results in screening between 60 and 375 healthy infants to detect one case of neonatal cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. To reduce the screening burden, the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) suggests the following approach in jaundiced infants who are most likely to have breast milk jaundice because they are exclusively or near-exclusively breastfed: the evaluation for cholestasis may be delayed until three weeks of age in such infants if they have a normal physical examination, no history of dark urine or light stools, and can be reliably monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12394983\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in evaluating a jaundiced infant for possible cholestasis is to measure the serum concentrations of both total and conjugated bilirubin. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the infant has <strong>unconjugated</strong> hyperbilirubinemia (&gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [34.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> at two weeks of age), this is often caused by breast milk jaundice, but other causes also should be considered, particularly if the total bilirubin is markedly elevated.

Most patients should be evaluated with abdominal ultrasonography. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy may be of use in some cases. It is important to complete these studies expeditiously, as outcomes after Kasai portoenterostomy are improved with earlier intervention. Many patients will also require liver biopsy to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Additional tests'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-atresia#H19842428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary atresia&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest abdominal ultrasonography as the initial test because it is noninvasive, easily available, and can identify structural abnormalities of the hepatobiliary tract and abdominal organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The main utility of this test is to exclude other anatomic causes of cholestasis (ie, choledochal cyst). However, certain findings may suggest the diagnosis of biliary atresia, including absent (or nonvisualized) gallbladder and the presence of the triangular cord sign (triangular or bandlike periportal echogenic density &gt;3 mm in thickness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Ultrasound may also identify situs abnormalities, polysplenia, or vascular anomalies that could be associated with biliary atresia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Scintigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (sometimes known as a &quot;HIDA scan&quot;) is an optional second step performed at institutions where this test is readily available, provided that it does not delay subsequent diagnostic steps. It provides useful information about biliary obstruction. However, the test is associated with substantial numbers of false-positive results and occasional false-negative results (ie, excretion of tracer into the bowel despite biliary atresia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As a result, scintigraphy should be used only for supportive information and not to independently confirm or exclude the diagnosis of biliary atresia. </p><p>The test is performed by administering a technetium-labeled iminodiacetic acid analog intravenously and monitoring uptake by the liver and subsequent excretion into the biliary tree and intestine. Infants with biliary atresia usually have normal uptake of the isotope but absent excretion into the bile and intestine, whereas those with neonatal hepatitis typically have delayed uptake but appropriate excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, if scintigraphy demonstrates patency of the biliary tract, biliary atresia is unlikely, except in very young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, nonvisualization of the gallbladder or lack of excretion can occur in patients without biliary atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The test depends upon adequate hepatocellular function, and pretreatment for five days with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) increases the accuracy of this test by enhancing isotope excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, in most cases we do not use phenobarbital because it will delay diagnosis and does not obviate the need for liver biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-atresia#H19845741\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary atresia&quot;, section on 'Hepatobiliary scintigraphy'</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity of scintigraphy in detecting biliary obstruction is approximately 99 percent, and the specificity ranges from 69 to 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The results can help to support the diagnosis of biliary atresia before moving on to an open cholangiogram, or help to differentiate this disorder from intrahepatic causes of cholestasis that might not require surgical exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. The biopsy should be interpreted by a pathologist with expertise in pediatric liver disease. If the results are equivocal and biopsy was performed when the infant was &lt;6 weeks of age, repeat biopsy may be necessary.

The first step is an intraoperative cholangiogram, which is the gold standard in the diagnosis of biliary atresia. If the intraoperative cholangiogram demonstrates biliary obstruction (ie, if the contrast does not fill the biliary tree or reach the intestine), the surgeon should perform a hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai procedure). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biliary-atresia#H15007525\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biliary atresia&quot;, section on 'Cholangiogram'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2237786\"><span class=\"h3\">ERCP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an alternative technique available at a few select tertiary care centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It involves endoscopic intubation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts through the ampulla of Vater with a small catheter and injection of contrast material to facilitate radiologic visualization of the ductal systems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP for biliary disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ERCP appears to be a sensitive and specific means of detecting biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15-20</a>]. However, its utility in neonates is limited by the availability of appropriately-sized endoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], the need for deep sedation or general anesthesia in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and the lack of validation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-pediatric-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Pediatric liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any infant who is noted to be jaundiced at two weeks of age should be evaluated for cholestasis by measuring total serum bilirubin and conjugated (or direct) bilirubin. The laboratory evaluation of breastfed infants who have a normal physical examination, normally colored stools and urine, and can be closely monitored may be delayed until they are three weeks of age. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conjugated or direct hyperbilirubinemia is typically defined as conjugated or direct bilirubin &gt;20 percent of the total if the total bilirubin is &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. If the total bilirubin is &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> then lab-specific norms should be used but conjugated hyperbilirubinemia would typically be defined by conjugated bilirubin &gt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and direct hyperbilirubinemia by direct bilirubin &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants include several types of biliary obstruction, hepatic or systemic infection, metabolic diseases, and toxic or alloimmune insults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64995 \">table 1</a>). Biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis account for most cases of cholestasis in term infants. In premature infants, cholestasis more frequently results from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) or sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Stages of evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants after two weeks of age should be undertaken in a staged approach, guided by a focused history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111411 \">table 3</a>), physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111410 \">table 4</a>), and laboratory evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111409 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Stages of evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The initial step is rapid diagnosis and early initiation of therapy of treatable disorders (eg, sepsis, hypothyroidism, inborn errors of metabolism). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The next step is to distinguish biliary atresia from other causes of neonatal cholestasis because early surgical intervention for biliary atresia before 60 days of age results in improved outcome. Key steps are ultrasonography and liver biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2616402644\" class=\"local\">'Liver biopsy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Additional testing is directed at the diagnosis of specific conditions and evaluation of associated complications (eg, coagulopathy). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If jaundice fails to resolve in an infant in whom a treatable condition is diagnosed (eg, urinary tract infection or galactosemia) and treated, further evaluation should be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the evaluation of an infant with cholestasis of unknown etiology, ultrasonography of the liver is almost always included and liver biopsy is often indicated. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2616402644\" class=\"local\">'Liver biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatobiliary scintigraphy provides supportive information about biliary obstruction and can be performed if the test is readily available and does not delay subsequent diagnostic steps. However, the test is associated with substantial numbers of both false-positive and false-negative results, so it should not be used solely to either confirm or exclude the diagnosis of biliary atresia. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Scintigraphy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is not routinely recommended. However, if expertise in neonatal ERCP is available, this procedure can be used to detect extrahepatic obstruction, including biliary atresia or cholelithiasis. (See <a href=\"#H2237786\" class=\"local\">'ERCP'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1488783728\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Robert J Shulman, MD, and Stephanie H Abrams, MD, MS, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dick MC, Mowat AP.
