It is like morning sickness, except the symptoms are much more severe.</p><p>Morning sickness is the nausea and vomiting that many women have during pregnancy. Even though it is called &quot;morning&quot; sickness, symptoms can happen any time of day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6752378\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with hyperemesis gravidarum vomit every day, often many times a day. Women can lose weight and get dehydrated because they are vomiting so much.</p><p>Symptoms of dehydration include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinating less often than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having dark yellow urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy when standing up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p>Symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum usually start during the first 2 to 3 months of pregnancy. Most women feel better by the middle of their pregnancy. But some women feel sick until late in the pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6752393\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I find out if I have hyperemesis gravidarum?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have hyperemesis gravidarum by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6752410\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse might do tests to see if the vomiting is hurting your body and to make sure another condition isn't causing your symptoms. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ultrasound to check your baby</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6752425\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To feel better, you can try the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat as soon as you feel hungry, or even before you feel hungry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Snack often and eat small meals. The best foods to eat are high in protein or carbohydrates, and low in fat. These include crackers, bread, pretzels, nuts, and low-fat yogurt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid foods that are spicy, greasy, or acidic (such as oranges).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink cold, clear beverages, such as sports drinks and ginger ale. Avoid coffee. Also, try to drink between meals, rather than with a meal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suck on popsicles or ginger-flavored lollipops.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brush your teeth right after you eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid lying down right after you eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take your vitamins at bedtime with a snack, not in the morning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid things in your environment that upset your stomach, such as stuffy rooms, strong smells, hot places, or loud noises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have someone make your meals for you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear &quot;acupressure&quot; bands on your wrists. These are special bands that can help with morning or motion sickness.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6752440\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant, see your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of the symptoms listed above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6752455\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hyperemesis gravidarum treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on how severe your symptoms are. If you are dehydrated or have lost a lot of weight, you will probably need to be treated in the hospital with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids that go into your vein through a tube called an &quot;IV&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to help stop your nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p>If this treatment doesn't work, your doctor can feed you through a tube that goes in your nose and down into your stomach or through a vein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6752470\"><span class=\"h1\">Can hyperemesis gravidarum be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors strongly recommend that all women who might get pregnant or who are pregnant take vitamins. The vitamin should contain at least 400 micrograms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">folic acid</a>. Taking vitamins before pregnancy and in early pregnancy might help prevent nausea and vomiting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6752485\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby be healthy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Babies born to women with hyperemesis gravidarum for the entire pregnancy are a little more likely to be smaller than average. But otherwise, the condition doesn't seem to cause problems. Taking medicines for nausea and vomiting during the pregnancy should not affect the baby either.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6752502\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=morning-sickness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Morning sickness (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-before-and-during-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nutrition before and during pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
