A cell of origin has been proposed for each type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) based upon morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic features of the malignant cells. However, in many cases this is not clear cut. Some NHLs classified as the same NHL subtype may be derived from cells at different stages of maturation (eg, germinal center B cell like diffuse large B cell lymphoma versus activated B cell like diffuse large B cell lymphoma). Other NHL subtypes do not have an easily identified cell of origin (eg, hairy cell leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia).

Normal B cell development can be divided into three main stages (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development#H1229513\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;, section on 'B cell development'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-germinal center &ndash; Normal early B cell development takes place in the bone marrow and results in the transformation of a B progenitor cell (pre-pro B cell) into a mature B cell. Mature B cells have undergone immunoglobulin VDJ gene rearrangement and express a complete IgM antibody molecule on the cell surface. After release from the bone marrow, antigen-na&iuml;ve mature B cells are exposed to antigen in the interfollicular area of the secondary lymphoid tissues (eg, lymph nodes, spleen). After this exposure, the majority migrate into the germinal center. A small population of antigen-na&iuml;ve mature B cells circulates in the peripheral blood or resides in primary lymphoid follicles and follicle mantle zones. These cells provide the initial IgM antibody response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51396\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51396 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Na&iuml;ve mature B cells in the mantle zone are thought to give rise to mantle cell lymphoma.

In addition, the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable region genes and other genes that are off-targets for somatic hypermutation (eg, BCL-6) undergo mutation in the germinal center and act as markers of germinal center transit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Centroblasts are thought to give rise to Burkitt <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoma/leukemia</span> and germinal center B cell (GCB) diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

Antigen exposure stimulates their transformation into T lymphoblasts which then become effector cells, memory cells, or follicular helper T cells of germinal centers. In contrast, <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/delta</span> T cells undergo little cellular expansion within the thymus, but may expand considerably in the periphery. NK cells develop in the bone marrow and travel to the spleen, mucosa, and peripheral blood without maturing in the thymus.

In some cases there is a genetic predisposition for the development of certain non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes (eg, familial chronic lymphocytic <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/small</span> lymphocytic lymphoma <span class=\"nowrap\">[CLL/SLL])</span>. In addition, the lymph node microenvironment, which includes stromal cells, macrophages, regulatory T cells, and the lymph node vasculature, has been implicated in the promotion of lymphomagenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Several important features distinguish the mechanism and type of genetic alterations associated with lymphoma from those associated with solid tumors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During most stages of NHL, the genome of the malignant cells is relatively stable. This is in contrast to the generalized random instability typical of many solid tumors, especially those of epithelial origin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoma cells generally lack microsatellite instability, the hallmark of molecular defects in DNA mismatch repair genes observed in some hereditary syndromes leading to a predisposition to developing cancer, as well as in most sporadic tumor types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Microsatellite instability has been described in a small percentage of lymphomas, specifically those arising in the context of immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At current levels of characterization, the genome of most lymphoma types is characterized by few, sometimes single, non-random chromosomal abnormalities, commonly represented by balanced chromosomal translocations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition to these translocations, the advent of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) allowed the identification of a greater number of unbalanced chromosomal alterations in lymphomas than previously thought. Although often present at diagnosis, these unbalanced abnormalities increase with disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One notable exception to the frequency of balanced translocations is <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL,</span> which typically has unbalanced genetic abnormalities, and in which an increasing number of such abnormalities is associated with a progressively worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Mutations activating the B cell receptor and NFKB pathway in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are not surprising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. More unexpected pathways include RNA splicing mutations in <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], NOTCH pathway mutations in <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] and marginal zone lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and frequent mutations of genes that regulate histone modifications, including MLL2, MEF2B, EZH2, and CREBBP in DLBCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], and CREBBP, EP300 and MLL2 in follicular lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p>At the molecular level, the genetic lesions identified thus far in the lymphomas include the activation of oncogenes by chromosomal translocations, as well as the inactivation of tumor suppressor loci by chromosomal deletion or mutation. Of importance, the genome in certain lymphoma subtypes has been altered by the introduction of exogenous genes via a number of oncogenic viruses. Point mutations may also result in the changes in the epigenetic control of transcription (eg, TET mutations, DNMT3A mutations) or process of translation (eg, spliceosome mutations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/11,12,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,19,20</a>]. The full spectrum of somatic mutations has yet to be defined. (See <a href=\"#H38689727\" class=\"local\">'Viral genome integration'</a> below.)</p><p>Deletions and mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which may represent the most common genetic alteration in human cancer, are relatively restricted to specific subsets of NHL, including late stages of follicular lymphoma, <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL,</span> mantle cell NHL, and Burkitt lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The mechanisms of p53 inactivation in NHL are similar to those detected in human neoplasia in general, occurring through point mutation of one allele <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chromosomal deletion of the second allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The occurrence of NHL variants associated with specific chromosomal deletions also suggests the loss of currently unknown tumor suppressor genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The most frequent of these deletions involves the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The observations that 6q deletions may occur as the sole cytogenetic abnormality in some NHL cases, and are associated with poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], strongly support a pathogenetic role for these alterations. Deletions of chromosome 13q14 represent the most frequent lesion in <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL,</span> occurring in more than 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Mapping studies have determined that the minimal region of deletion does not include the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene, which is also located on chromosome 13q14, but rather is focused on MIR15-16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These micro-RNA genes, such as miR-15a or miR-16-1, may also act as tumor suppressors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. MicroRNAs are small conserved noncoding RNAs that downregulate their target genes by specifically decreasing their mRNA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> 2 (Bcl-2) gene is thought to be a target of <span class=\"nowrap\">miR-15a/miR16-1</span>.

These aberrations might also represent mistakes within the mechanisms involved in antigen receptor gene rearrangements in lymphoid cells. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that most translocations in NHL involve chromosomal breakpoints within immunoglobulin (Ig) loci in B cell NHL and within T cell receptor (TCR) loci in T cell NHL. In B cell NHL, breakpoints within the Ig loci are often located precisely within joining (J) and switch (S) sequences, which normally mediate Ig gene rearrangements during B cell development. Thus, translocations resulting from errors of the enzymatic machinery mediating Ig or TCR recombinations pathologically join sequences from different chromosomes instead of sequences within the same antigen receptor locus. These errors become apparent only when the consequences of the abnormal recombination provide a selective growth advantage to the cell. In addition, the genome in certain lymphoma subtypes has been altered by the introduction of exogenous genes via a number of oncogenic viruses.</p><p>The following sections will review the mechanisms by which antigen receptor gene rearrangements and viral infections may increase the risk of lymphoma development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38689713\"><span class=\"h2\">B cell germinal center reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of B cell lymphomas are derived from germinal center or post-germinal center B cells. During the normal germinal center reaction, there are two major genetic modifications, each of which are required for normal immune development, but also place the cell at risk of acquiring additional mutations that may be oncogenic:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class-switch recombination changes the immunoglobulin heavy-chain from IgM to IgG, IgA, or IgE.

The genomic instability created by this somatic hypermutation process may also be responsible for the generation of chromosomal translocations between oncogenes and the immunoglobulin loci in human B cell lymphomas (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Chromosomal translocations'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>BCL-6 is thought to be the critical mediator that allows germinal center B cells to tolerate the DNA strand breaks required for SHM and class switching without triggering apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathobiology-of-the-non-hodgkin-lymphomas/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
