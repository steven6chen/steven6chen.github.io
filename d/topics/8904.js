It usually affects the big toe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580285\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an ingrown toenail?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include pain, redness, and swelling where the nail has grown into the flesh.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580300\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for an ingrown toenail?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580315\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some people feel better if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a small piece of a cotton ball or some dental floss underneath the nail to take pressure off the toe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soak the foot in warm, soapy water. Do this for 10 to 20 minutes, 2 to 3 times a day for 1 to 2 weeks. You can also use 1 to 2 teaspoons of Epsom salts (available in drug stores) in the water instead of soap.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580330\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if redness and swelling become worse and there is pus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3580344\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an ingrown toenail treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the treatments you have tried on your own don't help, your doctor might cut away part of your toenail. He or she will first inject a medicine to numb your toe. Afterwards, you will need to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean the area 2 to 3 times per day. Make a mixture of equal parts of water and hydrogen peroxide and dab it on your toe with a cotton swab.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put antibiotic ointment on your toe.
