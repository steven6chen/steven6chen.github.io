Left untreated, H. pylori infection leads to life-long chronic active gastritis, which is a risk factor for both intestinal and diffuse gastric adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, H. pylori-associated preneoplastic lesions are a feature of intestinal-type gastric cancer and not the diffuse-type. The diffuse type is more likely to have a primary genetic etiology, and the involvement of H. pylori is probably limited to a subset of sporadic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Outcomes of H. pylori infection vary individually, and only a small minority of infected subjects develop gastric cancer (estimated at approximately three cases per year for every 10,000 infected persons). There are approximately 1,000,000 gastric cancer cases per year and 3.25 billion people infected with H. pylori worldwide. It is thought that modulation of the effects of H. pylori by genetic susceptibility, external (mostly environmental) forces, and possibly bacterial strain differences influence its evolution into a neoplastic or nonneoplastic process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-gastrointestinal-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastrointestinal malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epstein&ndash;Barr virus (EBV) is detected in 2 to 16 percent of gastric adenocarcinomas worldwide; there is a higher frequency in tumors of the proximal and middle portion of the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Several EBV-related genes (including EBER-1, EBER2, EBNA1, LMP2A, BARF0, and BARF1) are expressed in gastric cancers. However, in contrast to H. pylori, their role in gastric carcinogenesis is not yet established.</p><p/><p>The incidence of gastric cancer has been steadily declining in many countries, following a birth cohort pattern. However, this trend has been interrupted and replaced by an upward trend in young patients in recent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The causes of this phenomenon are unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-gastric-cancer#H91192772\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal versus diffuse types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two distinct types of gastric adenocarcinoma, intestinal (well-differentiated) and diffuse (undifferentiated), which have distinct morphologic appearance, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and genetic profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The morphologic differences are attributable to intercellular adhesion molecules, which are well preserved in intestinal-type tumors and defective in diffuse carcinomas. In intestinal tumors, the tumor cells adhere to each other, and tend to arrange themselves in tubular or glandular formations, similar to adenocarcinomas arising elsewhere in the intestinal tract (hence their designation as intestinal-type). In contrast, a lack of adhesion molecules in diffuse carcinomas allows the individual tumor cells to grow and invade neighboring structures without the formation of tubules or glands.</p><p>A molecular basis for this difference is now apparent. The main carcinogenic event in diffuse carcinomas is loss of expression of E-cadherin, a key cell surface protein for establishing intercellular connections and maintaining the organization of epithelial tissues. Biallelic inactivation of the gene encoding E-cadherin, <em>CDH1</em>, can occur through germline or somatic mutation, allelic imbalance events (eg, loss of heterozygosity), or epigenetic silencing of gene transcription through aberrant methylation of the CDH1 promoter. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diffuse type cancers'</a> below.)</p><p>Gene expression studies have identified two molecularly distinct types of gastric carcinoma: intestinal (G-INT) and diffuse (G-DIF). The two subgroups correlate partially with the classical intestinal and diffuse morphologic types according to Lauren&rsquo;s histopathological classification described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, the concordance between the genomic and the histopathologic classifications is only 64 percent. The genomic classification appears to be superior to the histopathological in separating the two nosologic entities in terms of prognostic stratification. Kaplan-Meier curves clearly indicate better prognosis for G-INT than G-DIF. Furthermore, molecular classification avoids the need to resort to terms such as&nbsp;&quot;mixed&quot; or &quot;unclassifiable&quot; to classify tumors histologically.&nbsp;Genomic variants also have therapeutic implications. G-INT tumor cells may be more susceptible to 5-FU and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> while G-DIF cells appear to be more susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>.</p><p>In direct contrast, the pathogenesis of intestinal-type gastric cancers is less well defined. However, it appears to follow a multistep progression that is usually initiated by H. pylori infection.</p><p>Some tumors display areas of both intestinal and diffuse phenotypes. In such cases, <em>CDH1</em> mutations and loss of expression of E-cadherin are seen only in the diffuse component of the tumor, suggesting that E-cadherin loss may be the genetic basis for the divergence of a diffuse-type clone from an intestinal-type gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The following sections describe the histologic appearance, presence of preneoplastic lesions, and molecular pathogenesis for the intestinal and diffuse subtypes of gastric cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INTESTINAL TYPE CANCERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intestinal type of gastric adenocarcinoma is most common in high-risk populations, more likely to be sporadic than inherited, and related to environmental factors such as diet, cigarette smoking and alcohol use. It is also the type that has decreased most markedly over the past several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In low-risk populations, the frequency of intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinomas more closely approximates the incidence of diffuse-type tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">H. pylori and the preneoplastic cascade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal-type tumors are causally related to H. pylori. While the infection usually starts in infancy or early childhood, there is a long latency period, and cancers are clinically diagnosed four or more decades later. During this period, a prolonged precancerous process takes place, represented by a &quot;cascade&quot; of events with the following well-characterized, sequential histopathologic stages: chronic active non-atrophic gastritis; multifocal atrophic gastritis; intestinal metaplasia (complete, then incomplete); dysplasia; and invasive carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>While there is a steady progression from infection to invasive cancer, there may be temporary episodes of regression to a less advanced stage. The manner in which environmental risk factors contribute to or influence the progression of H. pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-atrophic gastritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first stage, non-atrophic gastritis, predominates in the gastric antrum and is characterized by an interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53009\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53009 \">picture 1</a>). Occasionally, lymphoid follicles are formed. The term &quot;activity&quot; has been coined to specify the presence of focal acute inflammation (infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMNs] in the stroma and epithelial layer) in a background of chronic gastritis. For unknown reasons, the PMNs tend to be more abundant in the gland necks, where active epithelial replication takes place. Occasionally, collections of PMNs (microabscesses) are seen in the glandular lumen. The presence of PMNs correlates closely with active colonization of the gastric lumen by H. pylori organisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrophic gastritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrophic gastritis is characterized by multifocal loss of the original gastric glands, including mucus secreting glands in the antrum, and parietal and chief cells in the corpus. In some patients, active gastritis does not lead to gland loss. Non-atrophic antral gastritis is the predominant finding in patients who have an H. pylori-associated duodenal peptic ulcer. Such patients do not have an increased cancer risk, when compared to the general population. This finding supports the view that atrophy (gland loss) is the first histopathologic lesion of the preneoplastic cascade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62367\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62367 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-gastrointestinal-malignancy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastrointestinal malignancy&quot;, section on 'Importance of other factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Intestinal metaplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multifocal atrophy involving the gastric mucosa may be followed by the appearance of glands having an intestinal phenotype, termed intestinal metaplasia. These glands are first seen at the junction of the antrum and the corpus (ie, oxyntic) mucosa, especially in the area of the incisura angularis. The foci of metaplasia become larger and more numerous over time, extending to the antrum as well as to the corpus of the gastric mucosa. The larger the atrophic and metaplastic area, the greater the cancer risk.</p><p>As atrophic and metaplastic glands replace original glands, the normal gastric secretions decrease, leading to hypochlorhydria and low levels of pepsinogen I (produced by the chief cells of the corpus) and gastrin 17 (produced by antral G cells). These markers can be measured in the serum and can be used as an indicator of gastric atrophy and cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-gastritis-and-gastropathy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of gastritis and gastropathy&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The first metaplastic glands seen in the gastric mucosa phenotypically resemble those of the small intestine, with eosinophilic absorptive enterocytes with a brush border (multiple microvilli), alternating with mucus-producing goblet cells. This is the type I, complete, or small intestinal metaplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81064 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>More advanced stages are characterized by phenotypic changes that are more similar to colonic mucosa with the glands becoming lined by irregular goblet cells (type III, incomplete or colonic metaplasia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77310\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77310 \">picture 4</a>). Colonic metaplasia is frequently found around small (early) gastric carcinomas. Some consider colonic metaplasia to represent an early stage of dysplasia, deserving closer endoscopic surveillance than type I (small intestinal) metaplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysplasia (also called intraepithelial neoplasia) is the next step in the progression of the precancerous process. Although dysplastic cells have a neoplastic phenotype (ie, they are large, hyperchromatic, and have disorganized nuclei) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79435\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79435 \">picture 5</a>), they are confined to the glandular structures and do not penetrate the basement membrane.</p><p>Dysplasias are classified as low-grade or high-grade, according to the degree of nuclear and architectural atypia and disorganization. Rates of progression to invasive carcinoma from low-grade dysplasia are 0 to 23 percent, while the corresponding rates for high-grade dysplasia are 60 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H646035135\"><span class=\"h4\">Asian versus Western nomenclature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nomenclature of advanced premalignant lesions in Japan differs considerably from that of Western countries. In the West, gastric cancer is defined by stromal invasion, while in Japan, severe nuclear and architectural abnormalities, even if confined to glandular structures, are considered sufficient to classify a lesion as a carcinoma. Japanese pathologists use the term &quot;adenoma&quot; to describe lesions that, in Western countries, would be labeled low-grade dysplasia. The Padova classification attempts to reconcile the two systems by assigning numerical categories based upon the descriptive findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58718 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>These discrepancies are more semantic than substantial. In Western countries, close endoscopic monitoring is considered appropriate for patients with low-grade gastric dysplasia with intervention only if the lesions progress. On the other hand, the majority of clinicians (although not all) recommend surgical or endoscopic resection for patients with high-grade dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This is because areas of microinvasion can be found in some patients undergoing resection for high-grade dysplasia, although the proportion is not well established. In Japan, most &quot;adenomas&quot; and &quot;early carcinomas&quot; do not undergo surveillance, but are treated with endoscopic resection, a technique that is used much less in the West.

Some have their epicenter in the antrum or the corpus, away from the antrum-corpus junction.</p><p>Proximal carcinomas that are located in the cardia differ in a number of ways from more distal cancers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>From an epidemiologic standpoint, although the incidence of gastric cancer has decreased over the past several decades, this is accounted for almost exclusively by distal cancers. Cancers of the proximal stomach and GE junction have actually increased in frequency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-gastric-cancer#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Change in histology pattern'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardia cancers are also biologically more aggressive, with a worse prognosis, stage for stage, than distal cancers. Cardia cancers have a greater tendency toward deeper wall penetration, lymph node metastases and lymphatic vessel invasion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some have suggested that the genetic alterations seen in cardia cancers more closely resemble those of esophageal rather than distal gastric adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], although this is not a consistent finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship of proximal gastric cancers with H. pylori infection and their association with preneoplastic atrophic <span class=\"nowrap\">gastritis/intestinal</span> metaplasia has been questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p/><p>All of these observations support the view that at least a subset of proximal cancers represent a separate subtype from distal gastric cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>It has been proposed that the specific mucin phenotypes expressed by proximal versus distal gastric carcinomas may provide some indication as to the cell of origin and therefore, the expected biologic behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, the expression of mucins during the precancerous process is variable. MUC2 (an intestinal mucin) predominates in complete metaplasia; incomplete metaplasia, which occurs later in the process, expresses also MUC5 AC (a gastric type of mucin) as well as colonic types of mucins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Thus, the controversial &quot;cell of origin&quot; of gastric cancer is not identified by mucin phenotype, and as will be discussed below, may actually arise from bone marrow. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Migrating bone marrow derived cells'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H646035157\"><span class=\"h4\">Histologic appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57594\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57594 \">table 2</a>) assigns the terms tubular, papillary and mucinous to the histologic varieties of intestinal-type cancers. Rarely, adenosquamous histology is observed. Some intestinal-type tumors do not form tubules and their cells form solid aggregates. They are known as solid tumors because the multiple cell adhesions lead to sheets of cohesive cell aggregates without polarity or gland formation.</p><p>Regardless of the specific variant, the depth of invasion into the stomach wall determines the primary tumor (T) stage. In this regard, there are marked differences between the Western and the Japanese classifications. The Western system follows the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification, as defined by the combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 3</a>).

It represents a comprehensive guide to surgical treatment, linking the topographic location of the primary tumor within the stomach to the specific location of the lymphatic nodes to be resected. The TNM system classifies nodal (N) stage only according to the number of lymph nodes with metastasis, irrespective of location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The relationship between H. pylori infection and gastric carcinogenesis in humans can be illustrated by the following observations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-gastrointestinal-malignancy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastrointestinal malignancy&quot;, section on 'Gastric cancer'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic studies and several meta-analyses demonstrate a strong correlation between H. pylori seropositivity and gastric cancer incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H. pylori can be identified histologically in the uninvolved mucosa from stomachs harboring cancers or precancerous changes such as atrophic gastritis with or without intestinal metaplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p/><p>Regression of premalignant lesions has been demonstrated with eradication of H. pylori [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], although whether progression to invasive gastric cancer can be halted is still unclear. Only one randomized trial was sufficiently powered to demonstrate that invasive cancer can be prevented if anti-Helicobacter treatment is undertaken before the development of gastric precancerous lesions such as atrophy or intestinal metaplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Initiation of the carcinogenesis process has been linked to oxidative stress brought about by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) that is produced by inflammatory cells responding to H. pylori infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Nitric oxides are mutagenic and may induce abnormalities in the DNA of epithelial cells. iNOS has been found in the cytoplasm of dysplastic cells and gastric carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Furthermore, support for the role of oxidative and nitrosative stress in gastric carcinogenesis is provided by the finding that H. pylori isolates from high cancer risk populations have the ability to induce excessive expression of iNOS and spermine oxidase (SM0), enzymes linked to DNA damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>The ancestral origin of H. pylori strains also appears to play an important role in the rates of gastric cancer; this is likely due to the differences in the capacity of different strains to express CagA.

The basics of the <span class=\"nowrap\">beta-catenin/Wnt</span> signaling pathway are as follows.

The lifetime cumulative risk for clinically significant gastric cancer in individuals from these families is &gt;80 percent in both men and women by age 80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].

Because of the difficulty in early detection and the poor prognosis of these tumors when locoregionally advanced, patients with evidence of a <em>CDH1</em> germline mutation in the context of a family history of HDGC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>] are candidates for prophylactic gastrectomy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Abnormalities in <em>CDH1</em> have also been linked to sporadic diffuse (and intestinal) carcinomas. Somatic mutations in the <em>CDH1</em> gene are identified in 40 to 83 percent of sporadic diffuse-type gastric cancers, and promoter hypermethylation is also reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/127-130\" class=\"abstract_t\">127-130</a>]. One analysis of 174 sporadic gastric cancers found that <em>CDH1</em> alterations (both structural alterations such as mutations or loss of heterozygosity and epigenetic alterations) were present in 34 percent of diffuse-type gastric cancers and 26 percent of intestinal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. This analysis found no structural alterations among 19 patients with HDGC, but 53 percent harbored an epigenetic methylation. </p><p>Thus, the <em>CDH1</em> gene appears to function as a tumor suppressor gene and its inactivation follows the classical &quot;two hit&quot; model. While biallelic inactivation can occur through germline or somatic mutation or the <em>CDH1</em> gene or allelic imbalance events (ie, loss of heterozygosity [LOH]), the second allele is commonly inactivated by CDH1 promoter hypermethylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/129,131\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,131</a>].</p><p>Susceptibility to diffuse gastric cancer may also be linked to inherited polymorphisms in the <em>PSCA</em> (prostate stem cell antigen) gene, which is possibly involved in regulating gastric epithelial cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Preneoplastic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to intestinal-type cancers, diffuse carcinomas do not have a clearly defined precancerous lesion, even those that are associated with H. pylori infection.</p><p>Histologic analysis of early HDGC cases has led to a progression model for the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In gastrectomy specimens from members of cancer families, isolated neoplastic signet ring cells are seen at the base of glands, representing an &quot;in situ&quot; carcinoma.

A role for H. pylori in sporadic tumors has been suggested (since infection increases the risk for both intestinal and diffuse histologic subtypes), but no mechanistic studies have been published. As noted above, CagA does damage E-cadherin in experimental animal models, but it does not lead to the diffuse type of gastric carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

An example of a therapeutic gain from progress in knowledge about molecular pathogenesis is the identification of germline CDH1 mutations in families with an inherited propensity to diffuse gastric cancers. At-risk individuals can now be identified and targeted for potentially lifesaving prophylactic total gastrectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The identification of growth patterns and molecular abnormalities has also led to differences in the surgical approach to treatment of invasive gastric carcinomas. While most intestinal-type cancers can be treated with subtotal gastrectomy, total gastrectomy is usually recommended for diffuse cancers because of their tendency to invade locally and extend to the duodenum or lower esophagus. As noted above, for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, the multicentricity and lethal outcome at relatively younger ages has led to the adoption of prophylactic total gastrectomy after age 20 in family members with documented CDH1 mutations.</p><p>The most promising strategy to control gastric cancer mortality worldwide is through prevention, as supported by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H. pylori infection is the primary cause of gastric cancer and is a risk factor for both the diffuse and intestinal types.

Eradication of H. pylori has been proposed as a means to prevent gastric cancer by inducing regression or preventing progression of premalignant lesions (gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia) in infected patients.
