Nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH) is a rare but serious complication of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The most common cause of this type of hypoglycemia is tumoral overproduction of incompletely processed insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2), which results in stimulation of the insulin receptors and increased glucose utilization. Other potential but less common causes include the production of autoantibodies against insulin or the insulin receptor and extensive tumor burden resulting in destruction of the liver or adrenal glands. NICTH occurs more commonly in patients with mesenchymal tumors, fibromas, carcinoid, myelomas, lymphomas, hepatocellular, and colorectal carcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69283 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation of NICTH will be reviewed here. Islet cell tumors (insulinomas), other causes of hypoglycemia, and the diagnostic approach to hypoglycemic disorders in general are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults: Clinical manifestations, definition, and causes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Diagnostic approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first case report of a patient with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and severe hypoglycemia, extensive postmortem examination found no abnormality in the pancreas, extracts from the liver tumor contained no insulin, and the glycogen content was low in the liver (in contrast to the abundant hepatic glycogen in patients with hyperinsulinism) and absent in the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, severe hypoglycemia was mediated by mechanisms other than excess insulin and likely due to extensive tumor burden in the liver.</p><p>Subsequently, severe hypoglycemia has been observed in a small percentage of patients with nonislet cell tumors, usually of mesenchymal (eg, fibrosarcoma), vascular (eg, hemangiopericytoma), or epithelial cell types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69283 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Among tumors of epithelial cell origin, hepatocellular carcinomas are most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. The tumors are usually large in size, weighing on average two to four kilograms; they are located in the chest in approximately one-third and in the retroperitoneal region in two-thirds of cases.</p><p>No single pathogenetic mechanism explains all cases of nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH). However, the major cause of NICTH appears to be increased glucose utilization (particularly in skeletal muscle) and inhibition of glucose release from the liver due to tumoral secretion of incompletely processed insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2), termed &quot;big&quot; IGF-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>], or rarely, IGF-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-insulin-like-growth-factor-1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of insulin-like growth factor-1&quot;</a>). In one series of 28 patients with NICTH, for example, 25 had elevated serum big IGF-2 concentrations; the concentration of normal IGF-2 was reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Big IGF-2 also suppresses <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> and growth hormone release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The net result is continued glucose utilization by skeletal muscle and inhibition of glucose release, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Nonislet tumors can secrete insulin, although it is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In one report of NICTH associated with a cervical cancer, in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of proinsulin mRNA in the tumor, providing evidence for tumoral insulin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Another potential mechanism includes extensive replacement of hepatic tissue by tumor with or without glucocorticoid deficiency due to extensive replacement of the adrenal glands by tumor or hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11465817\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH) may appear ill due to the underlying tumor, particularly when the mechanism of hypoglycemia is extensive tumor burden in the liver. In such patients, common symptoms are weight loss and abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one series of patients with insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2)-producing tumors, however, hypoglycemia was the initial presentation of the tumor in 48 percent (31 of 65 cases), whereas the tumor was present before the onset of hypoglycemia in 52 percent (34 cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Symptoms of hypoglycemia more often occur in the fasting state and may include confusion, lethargy, diaphoresis, or progressive somnolence, with some patients presenting with coma as the initial manifestation of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hypokalemia may be present in patients with IGF-2 secreting tumors, likely secondary to the insulin&ndash;like activity of big IGF-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH) is based upon clinical and biochemical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient with known tumor burden</strong> &ndash; Regardless of the mechanism in any individual patient with NICTH, the identification of this disorder is not usually difficult. When a patient with known tumor burden is found to be hypoglycemic, the cause is typically apparent from the history and physical examination. In these cases, a search for other causes of hypoglycemia is generally unwarranted and fruitless, especially if the tumor type is known to be associated with hypoglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69283 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The causes of hypoglycemia in patients with known tumors include extensive tumor infiltration, resulting in destruction of the liver or adrenal glands; tumoral production of big insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2); or rarely, production of insulin. Dynamic testing can be performed to establish the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in patients in whom hypoadrenalism is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-response-to-acth-in-adrenal-insufficiency#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the response to ACTH in adrenal insufficiency&quot;, section on 'ACTH stimulation tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Well-appearing patient</strong> &ndash; A healthy-appearing person with episodes of hypoglycemia is less likely to have NICTH, although in some cases, hypoglycemia was the initial event that led to the diagnosis of a tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In such cases, a detailed evaluation to determine the cause of hypoglycemia is necessary. The diagnostic approach to hypoglycemia is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Approach to testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The first step is to review the patient's history in detail, including the nature and timing of symptoms (particularly in relationship to meals), existence of underlying illnesses or conditions, medications taken by the individual and by family members, and social history. Clinical evidence for adrenal insufficiency or nonislet cell tumor should be considered. In a patient with documented hypoglycemia, the cause may be apparent from the history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The initial laboratory evaluation includes measurement of glucose, insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and <span class=\"nowrap\">sulfonylurea/meglitinide</span> screening during an episode of hypoglycemia. In contrast to the biochemical findings in individuals with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, patients with NICTH have low serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations during hypoglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, the beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration is also low, consistent with insulin-like activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In patients with low serum insulin, C-peptide, and beta-hydroxybutyrate, the plasma glucose response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> administration can be used to confirm the action of an insulin-like factor. The plasma glucose response to glucagon administration is &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> unless there has been extensive tumoral replacement of hepatic tissue, resulting in low hepatic glycogen stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Although not routinely performed, measurement of serum IGF-1, IGF-2, and big IGF-2 (if available) may be supportive. In patients with NICTH mediated by big IGF-2, serum big IGF-2 and the IGF-2-to-IGF-1 ratio may be elevated. However, the absence of these measures should not deter from the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Diagnostic approach&quot;, section on 'Interpretation of data'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The finding of hypoglycemia with low levels of serum insulin, C-peptide, and beta-hydroxybutyrate (confirmed by repeat testing) in a healthy-appearing person should prompt evaluation for a tumor with cross-sectional imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If a tumor is found, evaluation should proceed as with any newly localized tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1897083342\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few other disorders that cause hypoglycemia with low levels of serum insulin, C-peptide, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. In patients with nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH), the plasma glucose response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> administration is typically &gt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. If the glucose response to glucagon is &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> possibilities include extensive tumoral replacement of hepatic tissue, resulting in low hepatic glycogen stores, or an alternative mechanism. Hypoglycemia associated with some medications, such as opiates or alcohol, can produce similar responses. Although rare in adults, hypoglycemia arising during primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency can present with similar biochemical findings.</p><p>Insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia occurs in patients who have antibodies directed to endogenous insulin. It has been described in patients with multiple myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Symptoms can occur postprandially, fasting, or in both states. Serum insulin and C-peptide levels are usually elevated, however, not low. Insulin antibodies can be measured to distinguish insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia from other causes of hypoglycemia. Insulin antibodies do not need to be drawn during hypoglycemia.

In brief, treatment of severe hypoglycemia, when the patient is unconscious or unable to ingest carbohydrate, requires a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> (0.5 to 1.0 mg). Patients brought to the hospital can be treated more quickly by giving 25 g of 50 percent glucose (dextrose) intravenously. This topic is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypoglycemia during treatment of diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Treatment of hypoglycemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1613276\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of the tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of therapy for NICTH is treatment of the underlying malignancy. When a tumor is producing insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) or insulin, complete removal of the tumor results in cure of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. If surgery is delayed, ongoing management of hypoglycemia includes increasing caloric intake (sometimes via enteral or parenteral feedings) and intravenous glucose or dextrose, if needed.</p><p>If the tumor is not resectable, palliative tumor debulking is usually performed. Depending upon the tumor type, chemotherapy, radiation, or selective embolization of tumor feeding blood vessels may be used to control the tumor and improve hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1613282\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In situations where the underlying malignancy cannot be treated, medical therapy is required to prevent recurrent hypoglycemia symptoms. Selection of glucose-raising drugs must be done in concert with knowledge of the potential interaction with chemotherapy. Thus, NICTH is often a disorder treated by the oncologist. The presence of hypoglycemia in such patients is generally associated with a poor prognosis. In case series and reports, hypoglycemia was controlled with glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> 40 mg daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-growth-hormone-somatropin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human growth hormone</a> (rhGH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/2,3,23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,23,27</a>].

In one review, glucocorticoids were used in 25 percent of the individual cases reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
