Breast masses or testicular tumors were seen in 10 women (42 percent of the female patients) and nine men (56 percent of the male patients, respectively). Data from other studies suggest that two-thirds of the cases of CNC are familial, and although males and females are about equally affected, transmission occurs through an affected female in 80 percent of cases, perhaps in part because of decreased fertility caused by the Sertoli-cell tumors, which are found in one-third of affected men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-due-to-primary-pigmented-nodular-adrenocortical-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Overt Cushing's syndrome caused by PPNAD occurs in 25 to 45 percent of all patients with the CNC; subclinical, atypical, or periodic Cushing's syndrome occurs in others, and histological changes in the adrenal cortex are found at autopsy in almost every patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-due-to-primary-pigmented-nodular-adrenocortical-disease/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>].

Patients with <em>PRKAR1A</em> mutations had more pigmented skin lesions, myxomas, thyroid and gonadal tumors with earlier onset of disease; PPNAD occurred more often in females while other tumors did not have sex predilection.

In addition, patients with suspected CNC should undergo echocardiography to exclude the presence of cardiac myxomas, which may cause significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-due-to-primary-pigmented-nodular-adrenocortical-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Establishing the diagnosis of primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) may be difficult, in particular when it occurs without other clinical manifestations (not as part of Carney complex [CNC]), or when there are no other affected family members. In addition, patients with PPNAD or micronodular adrenal disease (MAD) may have cyclic or episodic hypercortisolism, and radiologic imaging may be normal or show only subtle nodularity. However, the diagnostic steps are the same as for any patient with suspected Cushing's syndrome, including confirming hypercortisolism, determining whether the hypercortisolism is corticotropin (ACTH)-dependent or ACTH-independent, and identifying the cause of the hypercortisolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation will differ when one is investigating family members of patients with PPNAD or CNC as compared to isolated cases. The first step in evaluation of sporadic cases is to confirm the presence of hypercortisolism. There are a number of available tests, including 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion, 1 mg overnight <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> suppression test, and evening salivary cortisol. Cortisol excretion should be unequivocally and reproducibly increased.

In these patients, even subtle changes of cortisol secretion (ie, non-suppressibility with dexamethasone) are abnormal (plasma cortisol &gt;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L]</span> following Liddle's test).

The appearance of the adrenal glands on imaging in patients with PPNAD is often initially interpreted as normal, which is different from other ACTH-independent disorders where relatively large tumors are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-due-to-primary-pigmented-nodular-adrenocortical-disease/abstract/3,11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,18</a>]. In PPNAD, the overall size of the adrenal gland is often not enlarged, but instead is occupied by several small black or brown nodules spread in an otherwise atrophic cortex; this can be seen as a string of beads on thin-section high resolution CT scan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78837\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78837 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>This was illustrated in a series of 88 patients with proven PPNAD, 33 of whom had undergone adrenal imaging.

A unilateral mass was seen in 15 percent and bilateral nodularity was seen in only 12 percent.

In a French cohort of 17 patients, adrenal CT scan findings varied with either normal adrenal, micro, or macronodules. NP-59 scintigraphy was particularly useful in identifying the bilateral nature of the disease, but more than half of the patients with PPNAD had asymmetrical adrenal uptake related to the presence of macronodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-due-to-primary-pigmented-nodular-adrenocortical-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

It is a rare disorder; among patients with Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome, PPNAD is diagnosed in fewer than 1 percent. The hypercortisolism is due to multiple pigmented functioning adrenocortical nodules. It may occur as a sporadic disorder (33 percent), or it may be familial (66 percent), either as part of Carney complex (CNC) or as isolated PPNAD.

The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome may be challenging in some of these cases.
