It happens when your big toe points toward your second toe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16326135\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a bunion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bony bump on the joint at the base of the big toe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain around the big toe joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble moving the big toe</p><p/><p>Your big toe might also turn red and swollen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16326150\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a bunion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. But you might need an X-ray to see if the joint in your toe is damaged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16326165\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes.

Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicine to reduce the pain, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16326180\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a bunion treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the treatments you have tried on your own don't help, you doctor might refer you to a foot doctor, called a &quot;podiatrist.&quot; A podiatrist can fit you with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A special shoe insert (called an &quot;orthotic&quot;) to align and support your toe during the day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A foot splint to help to straighten the toe at night while you sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51796\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51796 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p>If you have severe pain or trouble walking, your doctor can refer you to a foot surgeon.
