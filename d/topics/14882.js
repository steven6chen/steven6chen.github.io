Fetal immune cells (eg, dendritic cells) already respond to maternal, dietary, and microbial antigens but are biased towards suppression of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-of-immunodeficiency-in-the-newborn-period/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. After birth, the newborn acutely faces an environment swarming with microbes. The normal newborn's immune system is anatomically intact, antigenically largely na&iuml;ve, and demonstrates somewhat reduced function of several immune pathways. Reduced proinflammatory responses may facilitate the transition from the intrauterine environment to the outside world, including colonization with the commensal microbiome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-of-immunodeficiency-in-the-newborn-period/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Apart from anatomic characteristics (eg, thin mucosal barriers), impaired proinflammatory and T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cytokine production and diminished cell-mediated immunity render the newborn more vulnerable to infection. However, most infants survive this period without illness due to intact innate immunity, other adaptive defense mechanisms, and maternally transferred immunoglobulin G (IgG).</p><p>Some newborns inherit a genetic immune defect that manifests at birth or early infancy, termed primary immunodeficiency (PID). PIDs are collectively relatively common, occurring in up to approximately 1 in every 1200 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-of-immunodeficiency-in-the-newborn-period/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Initial screening in the <span class=\"nowrap\">newborn/young</span> infant includes a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and immunoglobulin (Ig) levels. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL) 6, may give clues as to active infections; however, CRP and IL-6 levels are physiologically increased in the first hours of life. Measuring quantitative Ig levels (IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE) is less informative in <span class=\"nowrap\">newborn/young</span> infants because young infants produce only small amounts of Igs and much of the IgG present in early infancy is IgG transferred from the mother (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F99496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99496 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, a low IgG level may be due to factors other than low production by the infant. Similarly, antibody titers to vaccines are typically not obtained in infants under seven months of age, since the presence of maternal antibody makes the results difficult to interpret.

Lymphocyte-subset analysis (lymphocyte enumeration by flow cytometry) and other intermediate studies will usually exclude or suggest a diagnosis of newborn immunodeficiency or determine which group of disorders should be explored for a definitive diagnosis. Advanced immunologic tests are best conducted in a graded fashion, and referral to an immunology specialist should be sought early in the process.

Newborns show lymphoproliferation to nonspecific stimuli, such as the mitogen phytohemagglutinin or anti-CD3, but not to most antigens, because of lack of exposure. In addition, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions are decreased to absent in the first year of life. Thus, the lymphoproliferative response to mitogens is the primary test for evaluating T cell function in newborns.

If blood products are needed, they should be irradiated, leukodepleted, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative. Formulae should be sterile. Breast milk (either via nursing or expressed and bottle fed) is probably safe and is preferable given its multiple benefits, with the notable exception of suspected or confirmed maternal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

The diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) is increasingly complex due to the wide range of defects and heterogeneity of their clinical presentations, the increasing sophistication of their potential evaluation (including whole exome sequencing), and an increasing number of immunomodulatory modalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1054779459\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once an immunodeficiency is suspected, the next step is to determine whether the immunodeficiency is likely to be the normal physiologic susceptibility of a <span class=\"nowrap\">newborn/young</span> infant enhanced by additional factors (eg, prematurity, blood loss due to phlebotomy or surgery) that cause a secondary (acquired) immunodeficiency or a primary immunodeficiency (PID) due to an underlying genetic defect that alters the function of the immune system. The clinical features of each type of immunodeficiency are reviewed below, and examples of the most common causes of immunodeficiency in this age group are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100552\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100552 \">table 1</a>).

Many parts of the immune system in the healthy newborn are distinct because it is designed to mediate the transition from intrauterine to outside life.

Maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) is present at birth and wanes over several months (IgG half-life is approximately 30 days), with a gradual maturation of B cells to plasma cells capable of synthesizing immunoglobulins in the infant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F99496\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99496 \">figure 1</a>). This leads to physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, with IgG levels &lt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> from approximately three to six months of age.

In the newborn, a secondary (acquired) immunodeficiency is usually less severe than a PID, and the defect(s) correct(s) over time. However, similar to a PID, it may be accompanied by infection, growth failure, cytopenias, or organ dysfunction. Examples of factors that can cause secondary immunodeficiency include prematurity, blood loss (with resultant hypogammaglobulinemia) due to surgery or frequent phlebotomy, maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">factors/in</span> utero exposures, use of immunosuppressive agents, biochemical abnormalities, environmental exposures, infections, and miscellaneous disorders. The factors most pertinent in newborns and young infants are mentioned here.

Infants with WAS may present with petechiae, melena, soft tissue bruising, or bleeding after circumcision. The T cell deficiency may result in <em>Pneumocystis </em>infection, meningitis, viral infections, or thrush.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is considered the only curative option. Approximately half of patients with IPEX are diagnosed in the neonatal period with the classical triad of enteropathy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and eczema. Later, failure to thrive is a hallmark of the disease. Other manifestations include nephropathy (autoimmune or secondary to malnutrition and medications), hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thyroiditis, and hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-of-immunodeficiency-in-the-newborn-period/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

This disorder is characterized by an ataxic gait, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and sensitivity to radiation with genomic instability. Early recognition is imperative to avoid radiation exposure.

Affected patients are more susceptible to bacterial (eg, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Nocardia asteroides</em>, <em>Salmonella typhi</em>) and fungal (eg, <em>Candida</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em> species) infections but have a normal resistance to viral infections. Response to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) may also be abnormal, particularly in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). The most common sites of infection are the respiratory tract and skin. Tissue and organ abscesses also occur. Other frequent manifestations include abnormal wound healing, <span class=\"nowrap\">dermatitis/eczema,</span> and stomatitis. Many patients have growth failure. Most patients are diagnosed in infancy due to the severity of the infection or the unusual presentation of the organism.

Other clinical manifestations include growth failure, abnormal wound healing, diarrhea, and infected dermatitis. The X-linked form can present in infancy. Autosomal (non-X-linked) variants of CGD exist. Thus, females can be affected.

These disorders are associated with impaired microbe-induced cytokine induction and present as recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe pyogenic infections. The first bacterial infection occurred during the neonatal period in approximately 30 percent of patients with IRAK-4 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-of-immunodeficiency-in-the-newborn-period/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Infections with <em>S.</em> <em>pneumoniae</em>, staphylococcal<em> </em>spp, and <em>P. aeruginosa </em>are most frequent in these patients. Clinical and laboratory signs of inflammation develop slowly in these patients, even in cases of severe infection. Weak inflammatory responses, including modest or absent C-reactive protein (CRP) production and low-grade fever despite severe infection, provide a further clue to these defects.
