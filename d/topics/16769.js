Locally advanced unresectable and metastatic gastroesophageal cancers are not curable conditions, and the goals of therapy include palliation of symptoms and prolongation of survival. Palliative modalities for advanced esophageal or gastric cancer can be either local or systemic. While systemic therapy is the most effective treatment modality for patients with metastatic disease and it may adequately palliate dysphagia, other symptoms such as nausea, pain, obstruction, perforation, or bleeding from a locally advanced or locally recurrent primary tumor often require multidisciplinary management using endoscopic, surgical, radiotherapeutic, or other approaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=local-palliation-for-advanced-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Local palliation for advanced gastric cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-palliation-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic palliation of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will cover systemic therapy for advanced unresectable and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer. Neoadjuvant strategies for locoregionally advanced but potentially resectable esophageal and gastric cancer; the use of chemotherapy with and without radiation for patients with localized, potentially resectable disease; local methods for palliation in patients with advanced disease; and hepatic metastasectomy for the rare patient with isolated gastric cancer liver metastases are discussed separately.

In the 1970s, SCC accounted for approximately 70 percent of all esophageal cancers, and 22 percent of tumors were located in the upper third of the thoracic esophagus or in the cervical esophagus. Since the mid-1970s, the incidence of SCC in the United States has been declining steadily, while the incidence of adenocarcinoma in white males rose by 350 percent from 1974 to 1994. Adenocarcinoma surpassed SCC as the dominant histology in the early 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. At the same time, there has also been a shift in location of esophageal cancers over time. At present, 86 percent of esophageal cancers arise in the distal one-third of the thoracic esophagus, 13 percent in the middle third, and only 1 percent in the upper third or cervical esophagus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathobiology-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More than 90 percent of stomach cancers are adenocarcinomas. In 1930, most cases originated in the distal stomach (gastric body and antrum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79793\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79793 \">figure 1</a>)). Since then, the incidence of distal gastric carcinoma has declined dramatically, while the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and proximal stomach has increased at a rate exceeding that of any other cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The increasing incidence has paralleled the rise in incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The term &quot;EGJ tumor&quot; reflects the frequent difficulty in separating the primary location of distal esophageal and proximal gastric cancers; their natural history, response to therapy, and overall prognosis appears to be similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chemotherapy drugs that were tested for esophageal cancer at a time when SCC was the predominant histology (1970s and 1980s) were those initially developed for SCC of the head and neck, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vindesine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vindesine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>. The combination of FU plus cisplatin (FP) was adopted by many as a safe and effective standard regimen, and studies focused on the benefit of adding a third agent to the FP backbone.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, at a time when distal gastric adenocarcinomas were the most common stomach malignancy, most regimens for advanced gastric cancer were based upon FU plus an anthracycline. Cisplatin-based combinations (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epirubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epirubicin</a>, FU, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> [ECF]) were eventually shown to be superior to noncisplatin-containing regimens and became the reference regimens for advanced gastric cancer. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'ECF'</a> below.)</p><p>Coincident with the epidemiologic changes in histologic and anatomic distribution, the treatment of advanced gastric and esophageal cancers converged, and the majority of clinical trials conducted since the mid-1990s include patients with gastric, esophageal, or EGJ cancer, regardless of histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Although SCCs now represent a small minority of patients enrolled on most clinical trials, histologic subtype did not appear to play a major role in response rate or survival duration in patients treated with a variety of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for metastatic esophagogastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>].</p><p>However, this is changing as differences in genomic alterations in biologic pathways between SCC and adenocarcinoma are beginning to be elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Treatment for SCC and adenocarcinomas has diverged once again with the introduction of molecularly-directed therapy for adenocarcinomas of the stomach and EGJ. Therapies targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a>) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramucirumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramucirumab</a>) are applicable only to adenocarcinomas.

A number of controlled trials and meta-analyses provide evidence for the survival benefit of palliative systemic chemotherapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer/abstract/14-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-21</a>]. In one meta-analysis of three trials comparing chemotherapy with best supportive care, there was a significant benefit in overall survival in favor of chemotherapy compared with supportive care alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.3, 95% CI 0.24-0.55), which translated into an improvement in median survival from 4.3 to 11 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4031960416\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several cytotoxic agents are active against gastric cancer, including fluoropyrimidines, platinum agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>), taxanes (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'HER2-overexpressing adenocarcinomas'</a> below.)</p><p>Despite a large number of randomized trials, there is no globally accepted standard first-line chemotherapy regimen in advanced HER2-negative disease. In general, combination chemotherapy regimens provide higher response rates than do single agents, but this translates into only modestly longer durations of disease control and survival that are measured in weeks to a few months.

Another option for treatment at progression for patients who have advanced tumors with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR), high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) overexpression is immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1; ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a>).

At least in the setting of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), it has been hypothesized that tumors that lack the mismatch repair mechanism (ie, dMMR) harbor many more mutations (ie, they are hypermutated) than do tumors of the same type without such mismatch repair defects, and that the neoantigens generated from mutations such as these have the potential to be recognized as &quot;non-self&quot; immunogenic antigens. The biologic footprint of dMMR tumors is MSI-H. In fact, patients with mCRC whose tumors are MSI-H or dMMR (but not those with proficient mismatch repair [pMMR] tumors) experience clinical benefit from PD-1 inhibitors, and some responses are durable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-completed-clinical-trials#H23252073\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: Completed clinical trials&quot;, section on 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors and mismatch repair deficient tumors'</a>.)</p><p>The hypothesis that <span class=\"nowrap\">MSI-H/dMMR</span> tumors other than mCRC might be particularly susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibition with PD-1 inhibitors was addressed in a study in which 86 patients with 12 different tumor types, including advanced gastroesophageal cancer, whose tumors were dMMR were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-metastatic-esophageal-and-gastric-cancer/abstract/262\" class=\"abstract_t\">262</a>]. Overall, objective radiographic responses were observed in 53 percent of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21 percent. Some of the responses were durable. These data provide proof of principle that dMMR is a biomarker for response to immune checkpoint blockade that targets PD-1. To estimate the fraction of cancer patients to which the results of the study might be applicable, the investigators evaluated 12,019 cancers representing 32 tumor types for dMMR using a next-generation sequencing-based approach. Within this group, approximately 9 percent of the gastric adenocarcinomas and &lt;1 percent of the <span class=\"nowrap\">esophageal/GEJ</span> adenocarcinomas were dMMR or MSI-H.
