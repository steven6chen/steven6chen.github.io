The correlation between symptoms and the presence of prostatic enlargement on physical examination or by transrectal ultrasonographic assessment of prostate size is poor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2137980800\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 percent of men at age 50 and up to 80 percent of men at age 80 have lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) attributable to BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Common manifestations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Storage symptoms</strong> &ndash; Increased daytime frequency, nocturia, urgency, and urinary incontinence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Voiding symptoms</strong> &ndash; Slow urinary stream, splitting or spraying of the urinary stream, intermittent urinary stream, hesitancy, straining to void, and terminal dribbling</p><p/><p>The nature of symptoms reported vary over time and tend to progress gradually over a period of years. The severity of symptoms may not correlate well with prostate size on digital rectal exam in some men with BPH because differential enlargement of the transitional zone, which the urethra transverses, cannot be detected on palpation. (See <a href=\"#H225578892\" class=\"local\">'Progression of symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with BPH may have microscopic or gross hematuria. However, the presence of BPH should not dissuade the clinician from further evaluation of hematuria since older men are also at risk for other genitourinary disorders that can also present with hematuria, such as cancer of the prostate or bladder.

Although individual studies vary, in general, about one-third of affected men have moderate symptoms that ultimately require treatment, one-third remain stable, and one-third have some regression of symptoms in the absence of intervention.</p><p>The natural history of symptomatic BPH was described in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the largest and longest prospective evaluation of LUTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this study, over 25,000 men aged 40 to 75 years submitted an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57680 \">table 1</a>) every two years from 1992 to 2008. Among the 9628 men who initially reported moderate LUTS, about one-quarter progressed to severe LUTS over a mean follow-up of 5.9 years (a rate of 45 cases of progression per 1000 person years). Progression rates rose steeply as men aged. In another prospective study that included 527 men with a diagnosis of BPH, 21 percent underwent prostatectomy during 30 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the Florey Adelaide Male Ageing Study, which followed 780 men aged 35 to 80 years for five years, storage and voiding symptoms progressed in 40 and 32 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Features that have been associated with progression of symptoms include previous diagnosis of BPH or erectile dysfunction, older age, mobility limitations, poor mental health, high body mass index (BMI), hypertension, back pain, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and serum testosterone levels, and lower income [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>LUTS improve spontaneously in a substantial minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In one study, about one-third of men with BPH had a 50 percent reduction in the severity of their symptoms of urinary obstruction when followed with no treatment for 2.5 to 5 years after onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, in the previously described Florey Adelaide Male Ageing Study, 33 percent of men had improvement in storage symptoms and 23 percent had improvement in voiding symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Men with symptomatic BPH who are not treated have about a 2.5 percent per-year risk of developing acute urinary retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Age, symptoms, urinary flow rate, and prostate volume are risk factors for acute urinary retention in population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

BPH occurs primarily in the central or transitional zone of the prostate, whereas prostate cancer originates primarily in the peripheral part of the gland. Determining a causal association between BPH and prostate cancer is difficult because both conditions are common in older men and BPH may increase the likelihood of a patient being assessed for prostate cancer. However, an analysis from the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, where routine biopsies were performed, did not find an association between BPH and prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1240532065\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many other urologic conditions can also present with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urethral stricture</strong> &ndash; Urethral stricture often presents with voiding symptoms, such as slow urinary stream or straining to void. Other patients present with recurrent urinary tract infections, dysuria, or ejaculatory dysfunction. Most men have a history of prior urethral instrumentation or urogenital trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethral-strictures-in-men#H698386\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethral strictures in men&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder neck contracture</strong> &ndash; Bladder neck contracture presents with voiding symptoms, such as slow urinary stream or straining to void. It is generally related to scarring from prior urological surgery (eg, radical prostatectomy or transurethral resection of prostate) or radiation treatment for prostate cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prostate cancer</strong> &ndash; Prostate cancer is usually asymptomatic but can sometimes present with storage, voiding, or irritative symptoms.

The diagnosis does not require histologic confirmation, and prostate biopsy is only warranted if there is concern about prostate cancer. Clinical features that would prompt a prostate biopsy include an asymmetric or nodular gland on digital rectal exam or an increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2115708238\" class=\"local\">'Prostate-specific antigen'</a> below.)</p><p>Because BPH is more common as men age and there is not a high correlation between the presence of an enlarged prostate and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), the possibility of other urologic conditions that can mimic the symptoms of BPH or coexist with it should be assessed by history, physical examination, and a limited number of laboratory tests. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H283131542\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> below.)</p><p>In some patients, additional studies may be appropriate (see <a href=\"#H283131578\" class=\"local\">'Additional tests for selected patients'</a> below). Urology referral is recommended for patients with severe prostate symptoms (see <a href=\"#H41261365\" class=\"local\">'Symptom scoring'</a> below) or urinary retention (post-void residual urine volume &gt;300 mL) or if other urologic diagnoses are suspected.</p><p>Clinical guidelines for the evaluation of BPH were developed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and updated by the American Urologic Association (AUA) in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The European Association of Urology (EAU) and the Canadian Urological Association have also developed guidelines, which differ somewhat from those of the AUA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>].</p><p>Our approach is generally consistent with the AUA guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history may provide diagnostic information about the possibility of other urologic conditions. The patient should be asked about general health (diabetes mellitus is a BPH risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]), family history of BPH or prostate cancer, and the presence of storage, voiding, and irritative urinary symptoms.

The EUA endorses more general use of voiding records in patients with BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A digital rectal exam should be performed to assess prostate size and consistency.</p><p>A normal prostate is approximately the size of a walnut, between 7 to 16 grams, with an average of 11 grams, and is firm and nontender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. While estimates of prostate size are unreliable, most clinicians are able to recognize a very large prostate (&gt;50 grams). An exquisitely tender prostate gland may reflect the presence of prostatitis. The presence of asymmetry or nodules raises suspicion for malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rectal sphincter tone should be assessed, and a neurologic exam should be performed.

It is unclear whether benign hematuria is more common in patients with BPH than in age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, the presence of BPH should not dissuade the clinician from further evaluation of hematuria since older men are also at risk for other genitourinary disorders that can also present with hematuria, such as cancer of the prostate or bladder.

The <span class=\"nowrap\">AUA/IPSS</span> consists of seven questions: frequency, nocturia, weak urinary stream, hesitancy, intermittence, incomplete emptying and urgency, each of which is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 5 (almost always present). Symptoms are classified as mild (total score 0 to 7), moderate (total score 8 to 19), or severe (total score 20 to 35). At the end of the survey is a disease-specific quality-of-life question: &quot;If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition the way it is now, how would you feel about that?&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">AUA/IPSS</span> is a useful way to assess symptoms over time in a quantitative way. In one study, for example, the mean score decreased from 17.6 to 7.1 in four weeks in a group of men who underwent transurethral prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Individuals tend to answer the questions in a reproducible way, and the results appear to be valid when the questionnaire is administered by an interviewer to visually impaired or illiterate men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

However, other studies may be useful in selected cases. These include urinary cytology (if bladder cancer is a concern), genitourinary ultrasonography (for evaluation of renal dysfunction or urinary tract infection), post-void residual volume (if urinary retention is a concern and prior to initiation of an anticholinergic drug), and urethrocystoscopy (for urethral stricture, bladder calculi, and bladder cancer).

Residual urine volume can be determined by in-out catheterization, ultrasonography, or other radiographic methods. The bladder scanner, which can be used in an office setting, has made this measurement simple to obtain because it does not require catheterization or radiologic assistance. Normal men have less than 12 mL of residual urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], but most urologists are not concerned unless the post-void residual volume is greater than 100 to 200 mL. In addition to being a possible indicator of BPH, a large residual volume is probably associated with increased risk of infection and is a precursor to bladder decompensation. Measurement of the post-void residual urine volume is recommended by the European Association of Urology (EAU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In the past, large post-void residual urine volumes were considered to indicate the presence of severe BPH requiring surgery; however, outcome studies supporting this view are lacking. A Veterans Administration Cooperative Study comparing transurethral prostatic resection and watchful waiting in 556 men with moderate symptoms of BPH demonstrated that post-void residual urine volume was not a predictor of surgical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3207193215\"><span class=\"h2\">Urethrocystoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urethrocystoscopy is useful for detecting urethral stricture, bladder calculi, and bladder cancer.

Total prostate volume can be measured by ultrasonography to assess disease progression, and it may be useful in selected patients when considering medical treatment with a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a>), which reduces the size of the prostate gland, or if planning surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. When prostate volume was compared with enucleated prostate weight in men with BPH undergoing open prostatectomy, transrectal ultrasonography slightly underestimated volume by 4.4 percent (95% CI, 1.7-10.5), whereas transabdominal ultrasonography overestimated volume by 55.7 percent (95% CI, 31.8-79.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

The report contains the following information: volume voided, peak and mean flow rates, and a graph of flow in <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> as a function of time. To reduce the variability in flow rates, the voided volume should be more than 150 mL. A prevoid bladder volume of &gt;250 mL with a bladder scan can help to insure that the void volume is &gt;150 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Maximal urinary flow rates &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> are thought to exclude clinically important bladder outlet obstruction. Maximal flow rates &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> are compatible with obstruction from prostatic or urethral disease; however, this finding is not diagnostic since a low flow rate can also result from bladder decompensation. In one study that included 3140 men who with no or minimal LUTS, 54 percent had a peak flow rate &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

In a study of 108 men with obstructive symptoms in whom urine flow rates were measured and pressure-flow studies done, only 3 percent of those with maximal flow rates below 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> were misclassified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

The common clinical manifestations of BPH include <strong>storage symptoms</strong> (increased daytime frequency, nocturia, urgency, and urinary incontinence) and <strong>voiding symptoms</strong> (slow urinary stream, splitting or spraying of the urinary stream, intermittent urinary stream, hesitancy, straining to void, and terminal dribbling). (See <a href=\"#H2137980800\" class=\"local\">'Typical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with BPH may also have microscopic or gross hematuria. However, the presence of BPH should not dissuade the clinician from further evaluation of hematuria since older men are also at risk for other genitourinary disorders that can also present with hematuria, such as cancer of the prostate or bladder. (See <a href=\"#H2137980800\" class=\"local\">'Typical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH increases with age. LUTS vary in severity over time, and they do not correlate well with prostate size or physiologic abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H225578892\" class=\"local\">'Progression of symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many other urologic conditions can also present with LUTS. These include urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture, prostate cancer, urinary tract infection and acute prostatitis, neurogenic bladder, bladder calculi, and bladder cancer.

The diagnosis does not require histologic confirmation, and prostate biopsy is only warranted if there is concern about prostate cancer. Urology referral is recommended for patients with severe prostate symptoms or significant urinary retention, or if other urologic diagnoses are suspected.
