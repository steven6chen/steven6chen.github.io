Details regarding the medications used and the benefits of this procedure for specific conditions are discussed separately.

Therapeutic injection generally involves the administration of glucocorticoids to suppress joint inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with arthritis, joint aspiration is most often performed to differentiate bacterial (septic) arthritis from other inflammatory conditions. Empiric antibiotic therapy is administered promptly after aspiration in all patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of septic arthritis until culture results are available. Continuation of empiric antibiotic therapy is mandatory until culture results are available if bacteria are detected by microscopic examination of the synovial fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial arthritis: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-arthritis-treatment-and-outcome-in-infants-and-children#H480586431\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial arthritis: Treatment and outcome in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Empiric parenteral therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Arthrocentesis is of limited diagnostic value in children whose joint inflammation is not thought to be infectious in origin, with the exception that grossly bloody fluid suggests pigmented villonodular synovitis. The varied forms of noninfectious childhood arthritis are usually not reliably distinguished from one another based upon joint fluid analysis. For example, the diagnosis of the different forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is based upon clinical parameters, although children with documented JIA may subsequently develop infection in a concurrently arthritic joint and thereby require joint aspiration. In addition, gout and other crystal-induced inflammatory conditions, in which diagnostic arthrocentesis is helpful, are extremely rare in children and adolescents. Other <span class=\"nowrap\">mechanical/orthopedic</span> causes should be investigated if the fluid is noninfectious and the white blood cell count is normal.

However, fluid is likely to rapidly reaccumulate if additional medication is not given. In addition, surgical drainage remains the preferred procedure for fluid removal in children with septic arthritis, especially if it is purulent, even though repeated aspiration limits discomfort and joint damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-children-indications-technique-and-complications/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Joint injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are often used to treat inflammatory joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-children-indications-technique-and-complications/abstract/1,2,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5-7</a>]. They are most commonly used in children with a limited number of inflamed joints. The use of intra-articular glucocorticoids as adjunctive therapy in children with oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA is discussed separately.

Antibiotics given intravenously reach sufficient concentrations in the synovial fluid. In addition, antimicrobials may cause an increased inflammatory response when injected into the joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-children-indications-technique-and-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Intra-articular anesthetic injection for pain control preceding or following orthopedic procedures is also used by some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-children-indications-technique-and-complications/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to arthrocentesis or intra-articular injection of a noninfectious joint include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection of the overlying skin or soft tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-children-indications-technique-and-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergy to any of the medications being considered for injection</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthrocentesis or joint injection should be performed by experienced practitioners following an explanation of the process, benefits, and risks to the patient and family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many children will tolerate arthrocentesis in the office setting with the aid of topical or injected local anesthesia and appropriate reassurance.

It can be used prior to glucocorticoid injection to locally anesthetize the area, or it can be mixed with the glucocorticoid preparation to reduce pain caused by the injection of glucocorticoids into the joint space. Because the methylparaben preservatives in lidocaine may decrease the sensitivity of synovial fluid culture, lidocaine should not be injected into the joint prior to obtaining fluid samples for culture. However, this does not preclude its use to anesthetize the skin and soft tissues prior to aspiration.</p><p>EMLA cream (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics, a combination of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> 2.5% and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a> 2.5%) may be used to prevent the pain of needle insertion in children.

Ultrasonography is also helpful when injecting the ankle and other joints that are difficult to approach. The ready availability of ultrasonography has made it the technique of choice for these procedures when a skilled ultrasonographer who is comfortable with children is available.</p><p>Computerized tomography has been successfully used to guide <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/injection</span> of the temporomandibular joint in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-children-indications-technique-and-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The syringe should be changed following aspiration. Clinicians often find it is difficult to twist off the needle to change syringes while the needle remains in the patient's joint. To facilitate the exchange of syringes, a sterile hemostat can be used to hold and stabilize the needle within the joint space while changing syringes. Alternatively, a &quot;reciprocating syringe&quot; enables one to aspirate and inject a joint using the same needle without having to exchange syringes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-children-indications-technique-and-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Children with early osteomyelitis may develop a sterile sympathetic effusion (which appears benign) in the proximate joint. Sympathetic effusions may also occur in children with leukemia or other neoplastic conditions. Failure to recognize these conditions in a timely fashion may lead to a worse prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTINJECTION CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pediatric rheumatologists recommend avoiding excessive activity (eg, physical education class) over the 24 hours following injection but do not require bed rest. In addition, passive range of motion following injection is performed to both distribute the injected materials within the joint and to evaluate range of motion in the anesthetized joint. Submersion of the joint (ie, swimming, wading, hot tub, or bath) should be avoided until the skin wound has closed. In general, we advise 24 hours of avoidance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications due to joint aspiration or injections in children are infrequent and rarely serious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Postinjection inflammatory reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An inflammatory reaction thought to be secondary to irritation of the synovium by microcrystals of glucocorticoids can follow intra-articular glucocorticoid injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-children-indications-technique-and-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].
