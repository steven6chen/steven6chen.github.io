The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies endometrial stromal neoplasms and related tumors into four categories: endometrial stromal nodule (ESN), low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LG-ESS), high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HG-ESS), and undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (UUS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F95023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95023 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. ESN is a benign neoplasm that is cured with simple hysterectomy; thus, much of the discussion below will focus on invasive endometrial stromal neoplasms: LG-ESS, HG-ESS, and UUS.</p><p>Uterine adenosarcoma will also be reviewed here. Uterine adenosarcoma is a rare mixed epithelial-nonepithelial neoplasm that accounts for 5 to 9 percent of all uterine sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>An overview on the classification, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of uterine sarcomas in general, including leiomyosarcoma, is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-sarcoma-classification-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine sarcoma: Classification, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H127288093\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The system in use to classify uterine sarcomas is the 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) classification system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F95023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95023 \">table 1</a>). The terminology and classification system for endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) has changed several times. An understanding of the shifts in nomenclature is essential to be able to interpret prior studies in relation to the new designations.</p><p>Endometrial stromal neoplasms were historically characterized as either low-grade or high-grade neoplasms, and this classification is used in the older literature (some of which is cited in this topic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>In the 2003 WHO classification system, a change in terminology was made and low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas were referred to simply as endometrial stromal sarcomas, and high-grade endometrial stromal neoplasms were referred to as undifferentiated endometrial sarcomas or high-grade undifferentiated uterine sarcomas. This reflected the composition of high-grade tumors as pleomorphic, anaplastic cells with little or no evidence of endometrial stromal differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>However, a subset of ESS with greater mitotic activity and nuclear atypia not meeting the undifferentiated, pleomorphic characteristics defined as undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma has been described. These have been referred to in the literature by various terms including &quot;histologically high-grade ESS,&quot; &quot;ESS with high-grade histologic features,&quot; and &quot;undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma with nuclear uniformity.&quot; </p><p>The 2014 WHO classification system incorporated a category called &quot;high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma&quot; that is distinct from undifferentiated uterine sarcomas. Of note, the term undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma is no longer favored in this system. The following endometrial stromal neoplasms are recognized under the 2014 WHO classification system:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial stromal nodule (ESN)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LG-ESS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HG-ESS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (UUS)</p><p/><p/><p>The evolving categorization of these neoplasms makes it challenging to interpret studies performed at different times, especially as some neoplasms previously considered undifferentiated endometrial or high-grade undifferentiated uterine sarcomas may now be categorized as HG-ESS. In this topic, the pathologic, molecular, and genetic characteristics are described, as well as treatment recommendations based on the 2014 WHO classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

However, heterogeneous morphologic features (eg, fibrous, myxoid, epithelioid, rhabdoid, and smooth-muscle differentiation) can complicate their characterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Therefore, immunohistochemistry and the presence of molecular alterations are sometimes used in an effort to classify these neoplasms more precisely.</p><p>Contemporary studies have identified subsets of endometrial stromal neoplasms with overlapping molecular and genetic profiles and intermediate prognosis, which stresses the difficulty that can be encountered when trying to distinguish these entities through conventional means. Immunostains are frequently required to differentiate endometrial stromal neoplasms from smooth-muscle neoplasms; intraoperative diagnosis using frozen sections is uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H1765106548\" class=\"local\">'Molecular characteristics'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3729161112\"><span class=\"h3\">ESN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial stromal nodule (ESN) is the least common type of the endometrial stromal neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The histologic features of ESN are identical to low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LG-ESS), but ESN has a circumscribed, noninfiltrating border without evidence of myometrial or vascular invasion. Approximately two-thirds are found as isolated lesions within the myometrium with no apparent connection to the endometrium. They may be confused grossly and histologically with a leiomyoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Like ESN, they are composed of uniform cells that mimic proliferative endometrial stroma. However, they have myometrial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vascular invasion, which are distinguishing characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. LG-ESS often form distinctive finger-like projections that invade the myometrium, veins, and lymphatics. Histologically, they are characterized by densely uniform stromal cells with minimal cellular pleomorphism, mild nuclear atypia, and variable mitotic figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F88571\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88571 \">picture 1</a>). Of note, an isolated finding of frequent mitotic figures does not confer an adverse prognosis in an otherwise typical LG-ESS.</p><p>The diagnosis of LG-ESS may be complicated by variant morphologic features such as fibrous or myxoid changes, and glandular, smooth-muscle, or sex cord-like differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In neoplasms with focal smooth-muscle differentiation, the neoplasm is categorized as LG-ESS if the smooth-muscle component involves &lt;30 percent of the total volume. Neoplasms composed of a larger smooth-muscle component are designated as mixed endometrial stromal and smooth-muscle neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4150926217\"><span class=\"h3\">HG-ESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HG-ESS) is a term in the 2014 World Health Organization classification system that refers to a group of malignant neoplasms with endometrial stroma differentiation that exhibit high-grade nuclear atypia, sometimes associated with a low-grade spindle cell component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>The infiltrative pattern and vasculature are similar to LG-ESS, but typically there is a more destructive growth pattern with extensive myometrial invasion, necrosis, and lymphovascular invasion. Mitotic activity is generally &gt;10 per 10 high-powered fields. &#160;</p><p>HG-ESS is associated with more frequent recurrences and higher mortality than LG-ESS. Overall, prognosis with HG-ESS is worse than with LG-ESS but better than with undifferentiated uterine sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158431257\"><span class=\"h3\">UUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (UUS) is characterized by marked cytologic atypia, nuclear pleomorphism, high mitotic activity, and extensive invasion.

This results in the fusion of two zinc finger genes, <em>JAZF1</em> and <em>JJAZ1</em> (also referred to as <em>SUZ12</em>), and the production of the <span class=\"nowrap\">JAZF1/JJAZ1</span> (or <span class=\"nowrap\">JAZF1/SUZ12)</span> gene fusion protein. This is characteristic of LG-ESS (present in up to 50 percent) and has not been found in other uterine sarcomas or smooth-muscle neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In addition, there were no histologic features that correlated with the presence of this gene fusion protein. The <em>JAZF1</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>JJAZ1</em></span> gene fusion has been shown to disrupt transcriptional repression of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This may lead to activation of genes normally repressed by PRC2 and in cell models has resulted in increased cellular proliferation, which may explain oncogenic activity of the fusion protein in LG-ESS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Other gene fusion proteins associated with LG-ESS include the t(6;7), t(6;10), and t(1;6) rearrangements, which result in the production of the <span class=\"nowrap\">JAZF1/PHF1,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">EPC1/PHF1,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">MEAF6/PHF1</span> fusion proteins, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

The imaging results are useful to select appropriate patients for surgical staging and cytoreduction, if needed due to extrauterine disease. Extrauterine disease, most commonly in the ovary, has been found at initial diagnosis in up to 32 percent of women with LG-ESS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/11,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,40-42</a>]. Because of the change in nomenclature, it is difficult to report the rate of extrauterine disease in each of the high-grade categories (HG-ESS and UUS), since previous studies were based on prior classification systems. However, a small study of HG-ESS showed extrauterine disease in 10 out of 12 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-treatment-of-endometrial-stromal-sarcoma-and-uterine-adenosarcoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
