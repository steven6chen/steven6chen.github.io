A deficiency of the enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase causes the accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in virtually all tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Fat deposition leads to the formation of xanthomas, nodules, and plaques in the central nervous system, tendons, skin, lungs, and bones.</p><p>CTX is one of a group of neurologic disorders, collectively referred to as leukodystrophies, which predominantly affect the central nervous system white matter. These disorders are caused by defects in the synthesis or maintenance of the myelin sheath that insulates the nerves.</p><p>The main neurologic features of CTX are cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract signs, and intellectual decline. One or more of these is usually apparent by late childhood or early adulthood. The syndrome is slowly progressive, and while there is no cure, its course can be altered with treatment.</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of CTX.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) involves a genetic defect in the CYP27A1 gene that causes derangements of lipid metabolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CTX is caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene on chromosome 2q33-qter that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Deficiency of this enzyme, a member of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme family, results in increased cholestanol and cholesterol.</p><p>Fifty-four different mutations have been described in CYP27A1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. No correlation between genotype and phenotype has been established. The same missense mutation has been found in both spinal xanthomatosis and the classic form of CTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Inheritance of CTX is autosomal recessive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipid derangements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal catabolism of cholesterol depends on the formation of primary bile acids (cholic acid and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chenodeoxycholic-acid-chenodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chenodeoxycholic acid</a>) through various sterol intermediates. Ten different enzymes are required for the hydroxylation of the four-membered cholesterol ring structure in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol, and oxidation of its eight-carbon side chain in the mitochondria and peroxisomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p>Sterol 27-hydroxylase, in the presence of cofactors ferredoxin and NADPH-ferredoxin reductase, catalyzes the hydroxylation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha, 7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol at C27 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The deficiency of sterol 27-hydroxylase leads to the accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol.</p><p>The disruption of bile acid synthesis in CTX leads to the upregulation of CYP7A, the gene encoding cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis, the conversion of cholesterol and 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol to cholestanol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Hydrophobic bile acids are required to activate heterodimers that, in turn, reduce CYP7A transcription. However, in CTX, levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chenodeoxycholic-acid-chenodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chenodeoxycholic acid</a>, which is highly hydrophobic, are decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Nevertheless, the exogenous administration of chenodeoxycholic acid has been shown to downregulate CYP7A transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Bile acids are also necessary for feedback inhibition of hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA), which is involved in regulating cholesterol production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In CTX, increased activity of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase causes elevated synthesis of cholesterol, thereby enhancing hepatic secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors are upregulated, resulting in normal serum cholesterol levels in CTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the pathogenesis remains unknown, one hypothesis is that a membrane defect causes the accumulation of sterols in the eyes (blood-lens barrier), central nervous system (CNS) (blood-brain barrier), peripheral nerves (blood-nerve barrier), and vessel walls (endothelial cell membrane) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In human aortic and pulmonary endothelium, sterol 27-hydroxylase may provide local defense against the accumulation of cholesterol in the arterial wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Cholesterol is a major constituent of the myelin sheath, and its availability in oligodendrocytes is a rate-limiting factor for brain maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Cholesterol is also present in the plasma membranes of astrocytes and neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Furthermore, sterols are important in membrane permeability. Minor changes in sterol structure, such as the incorporation of cholestanol instead of cholesterol, can have deleterious effects on cell membrane integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Cholestanol is thought to be responsible for the neurologic toxicity in CTX. Evidence of a neurotoxic mechanism is supported by the finding of cholestanol deposition in neuronal cells, most notably Purkinje cells, in the cerebellum of rats fed a 1 percent cholestanol diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Furthermore, in vitro study of cerebellar neuronal cells cultured with cholestanol revealed increased apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence supporting a neurotoxic mechanism comes from a study of 12 patients with CTX who had magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), which revealed decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA), increased lactate, and normal choline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Decreased NAA is thought to be due to neuronal or axonal damage, and increased lactate is a marker for a defect in mitochondrial metabolism or infiltration of inflammatory cells. The normal choline levels argue against processes that cause membrane breakdown, such as active demyelination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitochondrial dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As just discussed, the finding of increased lactate on MRS suggests diffuse brain mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with CTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, abnormal aggregates of mitochondria were observed in muscle biopsies performed in eight patients with CTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. An additional case had decreased activity of respiratory chain enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase, as well as significantly elevated pyruvate and lactate in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Clinically, the patient had a myopathic facies (ie, expressionless with drooping cheeks and inability to smile or frown due to weakness) and generalized muscle weakness, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>The cause of the mitochondrial dysfunction remains unknown, but one hypothesis is that toxic effects of elevated cholestanol or bile acids or membrane alteration may play a role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic data are limited, but cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare disease. Based upon an analysis of a single CYP27A1 mutation (R362C), the estimated prevalence of CTX was 1.9 per 100,000 in Caucasians of European ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The disease has been reported in numerous countries around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/6,12,26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,26-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many systemic and neurologic symptoms have been identified in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), including intractable diarrhea, premature cataracts, tendon xanthomas, and progressive neurologic signs and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The systemic features typically present earlier than the neurologic manifestations.</p><p>Neurologic dysfunction involving cerebral, cerebellar, neuropsychiatric, myelopathic, or peripheral manifestations is usually apparent by late childhood or early adulthood, and progresses during adulthood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal cholestatic jaundice is often the earliest symptom of CTX, but does not occur in every patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. There is significant clinical heterogeneity, even among siblings with the same mutation. For some, the jaundice self-resolves; others require treatment with bile acids (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below). Fetal demise and death in infancy have occurred in siblings of CTX patients, including one child with jaundice from birth until his death at 13 months, suggesting that CYP27A mutations may be fatal in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Chronic infantile diarrhea, which is due to a defect in bile acid synthesis, is another early symptom of CTX. However, hepatitis of infancy and chronic diarrhea are rarely identified as symptoms of CTX until other manifestations of the disease appear. Most patients (75 percent) present to medical attention in the first decade of life because of cataracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/2,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,34</a>], and the overall incidence of cataracts may be as high as 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Xanthomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xanthomas develop in approximately 70 percent of patients with CTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. They typically form in the second or third decade on the Achilles, extensor elbow, extensor hand, patellar, and neck tendons. Xanthomas can also develop in the brain, lungs, and bones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Skeletal abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although serum calcium is normal, patients with CTX have skeletal abnormalities due to impaired calcium absorption (demonstrated by impaired radiocalcium uptake) that leads to decreased bone <span class=\"nowrap\">density/osteopenia,</span> osteoporosis, and fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease have been associated with CTX, including reports of premature coronary atheroma, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, aneurysmal coronary artery disease, mitral valve insufficiency, and lipomatous hypertrophy of the atrial septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. The true prevalence of cardiac disease in CTX is unknown, but in one review of 144 patients with CTX, cardiac abnormalities were found in 15 patients (10.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a series of seven patients who were studied with myocardial scintigram and coronary angiography, asymptomatic coronary artery disease was present in four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The most likely mechanism of cardiac disease and atherosclerosis in CTX is the accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in various tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, this relationship is controversial, in part because patients with CTX are more likely to have what looks like an &quot;antiatherogenic&quot; lipid profile, with lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature aging and hypothyroidism have also been reported in patients with CTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although mental retardation can present in infancy, most patients with CTX have borderline or normal intelligence until puberty.

In the largest series, with seven patients, the age at presentation ranged from 20 to 35 years old, and all had juvenile bilateral cataracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Other typical features of CTX, such as diarrhea, xanthomas, dementia, ataxia, and polyneuropathies, were less frequent than cataracts. Only two patients developed the classic symptoms; these were detected five to eight years after the onset of the myelopathy. In general, patients with spinal xanthomatosis have a milder clinical course than those with classic CTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head CT and MRI reveal diffuse atrophy, white matter signal alterations affecting cerebellum more than cerebrum, and bilateral focal cerebellar lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>On CT, white matter changes are hypodense, while cerebellar xanthomas are hyperdense.</p><p>In adults, hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI are observed in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and inferior olive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. With disease progression, these lesions typically extend into adjacent white matter. On MRI, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences may be more sensitive than T2-weighted sequences, as suggested by a study of 12 patients with CTX that found bilateral hyperintensities in the dentate nuclei on T2 and FLAIR sequences in 9 and 12 patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Both dentate hyperintensity (common) and hypointensity (less common) on T2 MRI have been reported in CTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This discrepancy is explained by the presence of hemosiderin deposits and calcifications in the dentate, which lowers the T2 signal intensity.</p><p>The presence of bilateral focal cerebellar lesions and the predominance of cerebellar white matter involvement helps distinguish the radiographic features of CTX from other leukodystrophies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65871\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef65871 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>In the spinal variant of CTX, abnormal signal on T2-weighted images was observed in the lateral and dorsal columns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disruption of bile acid synthesis in CTX results in a number of laboratory abnormalities.

The cerebellar findings of lipid crystal clefts, xanthomatous lesions, fibrosis, and hemosiderin deposits, especially around the dentate nuclei, are pathognomonic for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/50,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,54</a>]. In addition to the typical brain pathology, patients with significant spinal cord involvement have extensive demyelination, axonal loss, gliosis, and macrophagic infiltrates in the corticospinal tracts and gracile tracts.</p><p>Microscopically, xanthomas have shown birefringent crystalline storage material surrounded by multinucleated giant cells with foamy cytoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is suggested when the typical symptoms are present.

In patients with mental retardation who have a component of progressive neurologic disease, CTX deserves special consideration because of its response to treatment.</p><p>While CTX is suggested by the presence of xanthomas and cholesterol abnormalities, it may not be considered in patients lacking these systemic findings.

In addition, children with early-stage CTX may present with bile disorders, diarrhea, or cataracts, but may lack overt neurologic symptoms or signs. In such cases, laboratory testing for serum cholestanol and serum and urine bile alcohols should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The strategy of screening for elevated urine bile alcohols has been successful in recognizing CTX even when it was not clinically suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]; however, such screening is not routinely performed.</p><p>The presence of bilateral neuroimaging abnormalities in the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum strongly supports the diagnosis of CTX in patients who have clinical features that raise suspicion for the disorder.</p><p>Molecular genetic testing including sequence analysis can detect CYP27A1 mutations in up to 99 percent of affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrotendinous-xanthomatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Distal myotonic dystrophy, as opposed to the proximal and neonatal forms, presents as early as adolescence with impaired muscle relaxation after contraction, facial and distal limb weakness, cataracts, frontal baldness, and endocrine abnormalities. The characteristic myotonia of myotonic dystrophy, which may be confirmed by clinical examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by electromyography, should readily differentiate myotonic dystrophy from CTX.

Cholestanol is thought to be responsible for the neurologic toxicity in CTX. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic symptoms associated with CTX include intractable diarrhea, premature cataracts, tendon xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease. The systemic features typically present earlier than the neurologic manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic dysfunction, including mental retardation, dementia, epilepsy, parkinsonism, myelopathy, and neuropathy, is usually apparent by late childhood or early adulthood, and progresses during adulthood. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head CT and brain MRI reveal diffuse atrophy, white matter signal alterations affecting cerebellum more than cerebrum, and bilateral focal cerebellar lesions. Hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI are observed in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and inferior olive. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum and tissue levels of cholestanol are elevated to 5 to 10 times normal levels, whereas serum cholesterol levels are normal or decreased. The formation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chenodeoxycholic-acid-chenodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chenodeoxycholic acid</a> is markedly decreased, and the bile, urine, and serum concentrations of bile alcohols and their glycoconjugates are increased. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CTX is suggested by the typical constellation of CTX symptoms, which are seen in most patients with the disorder. These symptoms are (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neonatal cholestatic jaundice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infantile diarrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Premature cataracts presenting in childhood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tendon xanthomas presenting during adolescence or early adulthood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Progressive neurologic dysfunction beginning in late childhood or early adulthood.<br/><br/>Elevated levels of serum cholestanol and serum and urine bile alcohols are supportive of the diagnosis, which can be confirmed with genetic testing. Laboratory testing for serum cholestanol and serum and urine bile alcohols should be performed for children with bile disorders, diarrhea, or cataracts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children and adults with CTX, we recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chenodeoxycholic-acid-chenodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chenodeoxycholic acid</a> (CDCA) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The suggested dose of CDCA is 250 mg three times a day for adults, and 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in three divided doses for children. It is important to begin treatment before the onset of neurologic dysfunction in order to prevent irreversible neuronal injury; clinical improvement in established disease is uncommon.
