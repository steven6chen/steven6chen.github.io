They have been isolated from numerous environmental sources, including water and soil. NTM can cause a broad range of infections that vary depending on the NTM species and on the host's immune status. In immunocompetent individuals, disease can present as chronic pneumonia, lymphadenitis, or skin, soft tissue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone infection. Immunocompromised individuals can also present with any of these findings, but disease in such patients may also manifest as disseminated infection. Unfortunately, NTM are seldom considered as a possible etiology in infections of the soft tissues <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bones; therefore, delays in diagnosis and treatment are common. </p><p>The treatment of osteomyelitis due to NTM will be reviewed here.

Concomitant immunosuppression should be minimized whenever possible. There are no randomized controlled trials or comparative observational studies that have evaluated the efficacy of treatment for NTM osteomyelitis. Thus, treatment recommendations are based upon case reports and small retrospective reviews, as well as on in vitro susceptibility patterns. </p><p>Unlike isolation of <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, isolation of an NTM species does not necessarily dictate initiation of therapy. Because NTM can be isolated as a result of contamination of a clinical specimen and because the pathogenicity of the various NTM species varies substantially, clinicians must determine the clinical significance of any isolate and whether treatment is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteomyelitis-due-to-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, the results of in vitro susceptibility testing for many NTM do not correlate with clinical response, and therefore the clinician should use these data with an appreciation for the limitations of such testing. </p><p>Our recommendations for therapy are generally in keeping with the 2007 American Thoracic <span class=\"nowrap\">Society/Infectious</span> Diseases Society of America <span class=\"nowrap\">(ATS/IDSA)</span> guidelines on the management of nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteomyelitis-due-to-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

For many NTM species, there is no known correlation between in vitro susceptibility results and the clinical response to therapy. In vitro susceptibility testing has not been validated for all NTM species. Despite these limitations, susceptibility testing plays an important role in the management of NTM osteomyelitis. Recommendations for susceptibility testing of each NTM species are discussed below.

We also suggest aggressive surgical intervention for osteomyelitis due to other NTM species when there is extensive local involvement, when an abscess is present, or when antimycobacterial therapy alone is poorly tolerated or does not result in clinical improvement. We recommend early surgical intervention for NTM species that are difficult to treat medically, such as <em>M. chelonae</em> and <em>M. abscessus</em>. A combined medical and surgical approach is also recommended for patients with vertebral osteomyelitis in order to minimize the risk of neurologic sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteomyelitis-due-to-nontuberculous-mycobacteria-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].
