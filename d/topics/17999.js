Although VWD is common, only a fraction of patients come to medical attention because of bleeding symptoms and are diagnosed as having VWD. This low incidence of bleeding is due to the mild nature of the disease in many patients, and to the lack of bleeding challenges <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack of recognition of minor excessive bleeding (eg, heavy menstrual bleeding) in others. Thus, symptomatic VWD seen at hemostasis centers has a prevalence of only approximately 0.01 percent.</p><p>VWD is characterized by mutations that lead to an impairment in the synthesis or function of von Willebrand factor (VWF). There are also acquired forms of VWD that are caused by several different pathophysiologic mechanisms. VWF plays an important role in primary hemostasis by binding to both platelets and endothelial components, forming an adhesive bridge between platelets and vascular subendothelial structures and between adjacent platelets at sites of endothelial injury. VWF also contributes to fibrin clot formation by acting as a carrier protein for factor VIII, which has a greatly shortened half-life unless it is bound to VWF.</p><p>The treatment of VWD will be reviewed here. Discussions of the function of VWF, and the pathophysiology, classification, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of VWD are presented separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathophysiology of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16060148\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF VWD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inherited VWD has been classified into three types: 1, 2 (four subtypes), and 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71525 \">table 1</a>). Although discussed in detail separately, it is useful to briefly review the characteristics of the different types here because they may affect the choice of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathophysiology-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathophysiology of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis (classification) of VWD types'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 1, an autosomal dominant disease, is the most common, accounting for approximately 70 percent of patients. It reflects a <strong>quantitative</strong> deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF). The clinical presentation varies from mild to moderately severe, as determined by bleeding symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 2, which is usually an autosomal dominant disease, accounts for 25 to 30 percent of cases. It is characterized by several <strong>qualitative</strong> abnormalities of VWF (ie, altered size ratios or biologic properties). Four subtypes have been identified: 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2A accounts for 10 to 15 percent of cases of VWD. The mutations are associated with a decrease in the hemostatically active high and intermediate molecular weight multimers of VWF. Some mutations cause a defect in the intracellular assembly and transport of normal VWF multimers (group 1), while others affect a normal cleavage site in VWF and cause increased susceptibility to proteolysis by the VWF cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) after secretion (group 2). Affected patients usually present with moderate to moderately severe bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2B VWD accounts for approximately 5 percent of cases of VWD. The abnormal VWF binds more readily to its platelet receptor, platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ib; the increase in binding of larger VWF multimers results in their loss from the circulation and, in some patients, thrombocytopenia. Affected patients generally present with moderate to moderately severe bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2M is an uncommon disorder characterized by reduced binding of VWF to GPIb. All multimers of VWF are present but are not fully functional. Affected patients typically have significant bleeding symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2N is an uncommon disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, in which the mutations occur within the binding site for factor VIII and cause decreased binding to factor VIII, which is then catabolized more quickly. As a result, factor VIII levels are usually 5 to 15 percent of normal, while the platelet-related functions of VWF are intact. The net effect is that patients present with the type of bleeding associated with factor VIII deficiency such as soft tissue, joint, and urinary bleeding and bleeding after invasive procedures, rather than the moderate to severe mucocutaneous bleeding seen in the other forms of VWD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 2</a>). This disorder can be confused with hemophilia A; it should be suspected in females who present with isolated factor VIII deficiency (with normal levels of VWF activity and antigen) and in families where an autosomal inheritance pattern is suggested, rather than an X-linked pattern as seen in hemophilia A.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 3 VWD, an autosomal recessive disorder, leads to severe disease with extremely reduced or undetectable levels of VWF. These patients present with severe bleeding involving both the skin and mucous membrane surfaces (due to decreased VWF) and soft tissues and joints (due to the low concentration of factor VIII) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834 \">table 2</a>). They may initially be diagnosed as having hemophilia A before the results of VWF testing are available. Replacement therapy with VWF is usually required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H749479\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired VWD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VWD can develop in association with a number of disease states, including lymphoid malignancies, lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative disorders, autoimmune disorders, conditions of high vascular flow, and some medications (eg, valproic acid). The associated mechanisms and diagnostic evaluation are discussed separately. While many patients present with findings similar to type 1 disease, one-third or more of them have decreased high molecular weight multimers in addition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired von Willebrand syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10739675\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND CHOICE OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions about therapy begin with an accurate and complete diagnosis of VWD. In addition, the patient's history of bleeding with various challenges, response to treatment, and current medications need to be taken into account.</p><p>We recommend that a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (DDAVP) be carried out in all individuals with type 1 and most with type 2, but not in patients with type 3 VWD. This should be done at the time of diagnosis or when the patient is not bleeding acutely, in order to assess the response prior to its actual need. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Desmopressin (DDAVP)'</a> below.)</p><p>Subsequent minor bleeding episodes or minor surgical procedures (eg, from a site that can be easily visualized) can be treated with DDAVP once an adequate response is documented, without further therapeutic trials. (See <a href=\"#H749078\" class=\"local\">'Minor bleeding and minor surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with acquired VWD, DDAVP is most often administered as a therapeutic trial while the patient is bleeding; the response to DDAVP is assessed clinically, as well as by following VWF levels.</p><p>Replacement therapy with von Willebrand factor (VWF) concentrates is given to patients with major bleeding or major surgery (eg, surgery involving vital organs not accessible to direct observation, requiring more tissue dissection or for which greater-than-expected bleeding would adversely affect the outcome), or surgery in which DDAVP does not control the bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'VWF replacement therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H749103\" class=\"local\">'Major bleeding and major surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>The patient&rsquo;s general medical condition and current medications may also affect bleeding risk. A variety of medical illnesses can affect hemostasis and platelet function (eg, uremia, ischemic vascular disease). The patient should be specifically questioned about use of aspirin-containing medications or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that are commonly available over-the-counter and aggravate bleeding. If the patient has a condition that impairs platelet function or is taking an antiplatelet drug and has serious bleeding not controlled by therapy for VWD, consideration must be given to correction of the platelet defect, usually by platelet transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no laboratory test for VWF that correlates well with bleeding symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, there are no absolute guidelines about the best parameter(s) to follow when treating the patient. In addition to clinical monitoring, many experts follow the ristocetin cofactor and factor VIII levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; the latter is often the only result available in a timely fashion for clinical decision-making. It is generally felt that it is not necessary to completely normalize the bleeding time in order to achieve adequate hemostasis in patients with VWD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Guidelines regarding therapy for VWD have been published by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health and other agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. These guidelines are generally consistent with our practice, as outlined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H488549\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The five categories of medications for the treatment of VWD include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (DDAVP); replacement therapy with von Willebrand factor (VWF)-containing concentrates; antifibrinolytic drugs; topical therapy with thrombin or fibrin sealant; and estrogen therapy in some settings in women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75956\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75956 \">table 3</a>). There is also a role for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viia-activated-recombinant-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human factor VIIa</a> or factor VIII bypassing agents in the treatment of patients with severe (type 3) VWD who develop inhibitors to replacement VWF. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Recombinant factor VIIa'</a> below.)</p><p>Those patients with type 1, most type 2, and some with acquired VWD are likely to respond to DDAVP, while those with type 3 are unlikely to have a response this agent. Some patients with type 2B VWD can have worsening of symptoms with DDAVP, while others can respond. DDAVP should only be considered in treating type 2B disease if an adequate response to a trial infusion without persistent worsening of thrombocytopenia has been shown. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Expected responses to DDAVP according to VWD type'</a> below.)</p><p>The treatment of acquired von Willebrand syndrome (aVWS), including use of these medications as well as treatments directed at the underlying causes of the syndrome, is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome#H3899064269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired von Willebrand syndrome&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Desmopressin (DDAVP)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H749360\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of DDAVP administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desmopressin</a> (1-desamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin, DDAVP), first shown in 1977 to increase VWF and factor VIII levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], is a synthetic analog of antidiuretic hormone which retains antidiuretic activity but lacks vasopressor activity. It promotes the release of VWF from endothelial cell storage sites; this response is indirect, since it cannot be reproduced by direct exposure of cultured endothelial cells to DDAVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>DDAVP can be administered intravenously, by subcutaneous injection, or by intranasal spray. The subcutaneous preparation is not available in the US.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravenous dosing</strong> &ndash; When given intravenously for prophylaxis before invasive procedures or for acute bleeding episodes, a DDAVP dose of 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> (maximum 20 mcg) is diluted in 50 mL of normal saline and infused over 20 to 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The dose maximum of 20 mcg is commonly used in the United States due to concerns about increasing toxicity and diminishing efficacy at higher doses, although there are no data directly comparing different dose caps in a large sample of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A three- to fivefold increase in baseline levels of VWF and factor VIII levels is expected at approximately 30 to 60 minutes after the infusion, with the response persisting for 6 to 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The half-life of the released VWF will correspond to the particular half-life of the patient's own VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A repeat dose may be given at 8 to 12 hours if clinically indicated. Subsequent doses are usually switched to once daily doses for one to three or more days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]; tachyphylaxis and hyponatremia can occur with prolonged dosing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subcutaneous dosing</strong> &ndash; DDAVP preparations approved for subcutaneous use are available in countries in Europe but not in the United States; these are administered using the same formulation and dosing as the intravenous form. Peak levels are slightly lower and occur later than with intravenous administration, but other kinetic parameters are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intranasal dosing</strong> &ndash; Intranasal administration of DDAVP has become a favored choice for many patients who have less serious bleeding not requiring a hospital visit or who need treatment prior to a planned minor invasive procedure since therapy can be administered at home in a timely manner. As an example, intranasal therapy at the onset of menses has been used by women with VWD to control excessive menstrual bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Benefits also have been noted for epistaxis or bleeding related to minor surgery or tooth extraction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The usual dose of intranasal DDAVP is 150 mcg for individuals weighing less than 50 kg and 300 mcg for larger individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The spray is administered by metered puffs, each puff containing 150 mcg; one puff each is administered into separate nostrils when using the larger dose of 300 mcg. In adults, the VWF levels achieved with 300 mcg of intranasal spray are approximately equivalent to that seen with an intravenous dose of 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. DDAVP is seldom used in children under the age of two years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients and parents should be instructed <strong>not</strong> to use the intranasal formulation of DDAVP recommended for enuresis; this formulation has a lower concentration of DDAVP than formulations for VWD treatment.</p><p/><p>Tachyphylaxis occurs after repeated DDAVP administration, and doses of DDAVP are thus usually limited to once daily after the first day, for a total of three to five days.</p><p>Side effects of DDAVP include vasodilatation that causes facial flushing, headache (which can often be controlled by decreasing the rate of infusion), nausea, and occasional tingling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Both hypotension and hypertension have been reported, but are not common and are usually mild. Thrombosis has occurred following DDAVP administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], but it is uncertain whether the medication is causal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Common sense dictates caution with the use of DDAVP in patients with known coronary or cerebral arterial vascular disease (see <a href=\"#H749600\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> below). In general, DDAVP should not be used in conjunction with antifibrinolytic agents.</p><p>Hyponatremia can result if the patient takes in excess free water during the period of DDAVP administration; this has led to seizures from hyponatremia, primarily in young children. The effect is due to the persistent antidiuretic activity of DDAVP and has led to death, although adverse events requiring medical intervention are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/19,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22,23</a>]. Serum sodium levels should be assessed prior to subsequent doses in those taking more than one or two doses of DDAVP.</p><p>While nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs) should not generally be used in patients with VWD, their inadvertent use by patients receiving DDAVP may aggravate hyponatremia; accordingly, NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients receiving DDAVP for any indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although DDAVP is rarely used in children under the age of two years, it can be very useful in older pediatric patients. Monitoring for hyponatremia should be carried out, as shown in one study of 107 patients aged 2 to 19 years; this investigation documented significant lowering of sodium levels within age groups after administration of DDAVP, and second doses of DDAVP were withheld due to low sodium levels in 13 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another study showed that close adherence to planned protocols of fluid restriction in conjunction with the use of DDAVP in 69 patients allowed DDAVP to be used without complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>DDAVP may also have other actions, such as enhanced hemostasis in patients with platelet function defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function#H36\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;, section on 'Desmopressin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347246595\"><span class=\"h3\">Trial of DDAVP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A therapeutic trial of DDAVP is the best method to determine the effectiveness of DDAVP in VWD patients. We recommend a trial of DDAVP in all patients with type 1 VWD and most patients with type 2 VWD. We do not perform a trial of DDAVP in type 3 patients because DDAVP does not increase VWF levels in those with type 3 VWD. The trial of DDAVP should be done at the time of diagnosis or when the patient is not bleeding, in order to assess response prior to its actual need.</p><p>A DDAVP trial is performed by administering DDAVP at a dose of 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> intravenously after baseline blood samples are obtained for factor VIII activity and VWF activity (ie, ristocetin cofactor assay). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease#H623617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;, section on 'Factor VIII activity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;, section on 'VWF activity (platelet binding)'</a>.)</p><p>The dose is given in 50 mL of saline over 20 to 30 minutes. Further blood samples for factor VIII activity and VWF activity are obtained between one and two hours and at four hours to assess the change in the levels of these factors. Responses to intranasal DDAVP can vary somewhat from the intravenous, and some experts recommend a second trial using the intranasal preparation if the patient has been shown to respond to the intravenous form and wishes to use the intranasal preparation.</p><p>An effective response to DDAVP at approximately one hour after the infusion is a VWF activity level of at least 30 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/dL</span> (usually representing a three- to fivefold increase over baseline); levels of at least 50 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/dL</span> are optimal. Once an adequate response is documented, DDAVP can be used for subsequent bleeding episodes or invasive procedures without further therapeutic trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Expected responses to DDAVP according to VWD type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of DDAVP varies with the type of VWD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/8,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,27-30</a>]. Because of this variability in response, a &quot;test&quot; infusion should be given <strong>in advance</strong> of a planned procedure while the patient is at baseline, in order to assess both the VWF and factor VIII responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Once an adequate response is documented, DDAVP can be used for subsequent bleeding episodes or invasive procedures without further testing. (See <a href=\"#H347246595\" class=\"local\">'Trial of DDAVP'</a> above.)</p><p>The following describes expected responses to DDAVP based on the type of VWD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 1</strong> &ndash; DDAVP is effective in almost all patients with mild or moderate type 1 disease, including those due to accelerated clearance of VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In comparison, a high proportion of those with severe bleeding symptoms and marked prolongation of the bleeding time do not respond sufficiently to DDAVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/8,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,29</a>]. DDAVP is also ineffective in the rare patients with type 1 disease who have normal or decreased levels of plasma VWF accompanied by absent stores of VWF in platelets (&quot;platelet-low&quot; VWD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/8,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, in a study of 77 patients with type 1 VWD, complete, partial, or non-response to DDAVP was seen in 83, 13, and 4 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Most partial and nonresponders had mutations of VWF in the A1-A3 domains, and others who had good initial increases but short-lived responses had mutations in the D'-D3 domain.

However, since many patients with VWD also have low levels of factor VIII, it is necessary to replace factor VIII using a recombinant factor VIII product when treatment is first started with LFB-VWF if the patient's factor VIII is less than 20 percent. Subsequent doses of high purity VWF usually do not require additional factor VIII, because the production and half-life of endogenous factor VIII are generally prolonged sufficiently in the presence of the transfused VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/56,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recombinant human VWF (rVWF; vonicog alfa, Vonvendi) contains a full spectrum of VWF multimers, including ultrahigh molecular weight multimers, and adequate levels of VWF activity.

Most episodes were treated with a single infusion. For minor to moderate bleeding, the dose was 40 to 60 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span>. For major bleeding, 80 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> were given and doses sufficient to maintain a trough level of VWF:RCo &gt;50 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/dL</span> were administered every 8 to 12 hours for three to seven days. Patients were given recombinant factor VIII with the initial dose of rVWF; however, those who inadvertently did not receive rFVIII had a rise in the level of factor VIII to 40 percent by six hours and similar stabilization of endogenous FVIII. Patients had comparable VWF:RCo pharmacokinetics whether or not they received rFVIII. Approximately one-quarter of bleeding episodes were also treated with an antifibrinolytic agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adverse events with rVWF appear to be minor. One individual with a history of allergic reaction to VWF concentrate had chest discomfort and tachycardia for 10 minutes but did not develop any cardiac events, and there were no thromboembolic or anaphylactic complications or VWF neutralizing antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

The dose given is also dependent upon the site and the degree of bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75956\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75956 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>In general, the goal is to maintain the activity of factor VIII and of VWF (generally measured as ristocetin cofactor activity [VWF:RCo]) between 50 to 100 percent for 3 to 14 days for more serious bleeding or major surgery. The infusion of 20 to 50 international units <span class=\"nowrap\">(IU)/kg</span> of ristocetin cofactor activity as labeled on these concentrates raises the plasma concentration to 50 to 100 percent, or by approximately 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> (70 percent), and is administered every 12 to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. A &quot;loading&quot; dose of 50 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/kg</span> is often given at the beginning of the treatment period to insure reaching the desired level at the onset of treatment.</p><p>Patients with severe VWD (usually type 3) who have mucous membrane bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding, may require higher replacement doses of VWF (to reach 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/dL)</span>.

Also, platelet transfusions, when added to VWF replacement, may decrease bleeding in those patients with type 2B VWD who have moderately severe thrombocytopenia.</p><p>There appears to be a small risk of venous thromboembolism when intermediate purity factor VIII concentrates are used in high doses as replacement therapy during perioperative periods or for gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. In some of these cases, a high factor VIII level (&gt;200 percent) has been documented, which may have contributed to the thrombosis. Accordingly, it has been recommended that factor VIII concentrations be followed on a daily basis to avoid levels in excess of 200 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Use of recombinant VWF should prevent the higher factor VIII levels since it does not contain factor VIII (the only source of factor VIII in the circulation is the patient's endogenous factor VIII); this is particularly helpful in patients receiving VWF replacement for a longer period of time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis#H85744917\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Factor VIII'</a>.)</p><p>Replacement VWF is usually given by intravenous infusion over less than 20 minutes at 8 to 24 hour intervals, at a dose of 20 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/kg</span> to keep VWF levels above 50 percent or to control clinical bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75956\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75956 \">table 3</a>). However, studies indicate that continuous infusion of VWF may reduce the clearance of the infused product, thereby lowering the total dose that is consumed by 20 to 50 percent and lowering the ultimate cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>].</p><p>When using rVWF, it is recommended that one dose of recombinant factor VIII be given within 10 minutes of the first dose of rVWF if the patient's initial factor VIII level is less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/dL</span>. The manufacturer's dose recommendation for rVWF for minor bleeding is 40 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/kg</span> for the initial dose, followed by the same dose every 8 to 24 hours as needed clinically. For major bleeding, the recommendation is 50 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/kg</span> for the initial dose, followed by 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/Kg</span> every 8 to 24 hours for two to three days as needed clinically. rVWF has been approved only for nonpregnant patients over the age of 18 years.</p><p>In addition to measuring ristocetin cofactor activity, physicians may consider utilizing the platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) to follow VWF activity after replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. While the PFA can be used to follow some patients after treatment, it does not appear to be accurate for monitoring replacement therapy in patients with type 3 VWD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].

However, the obstetrician and a hematologist with expertise in the management of VWD should jointly evaluate the patient before or as early in the pregnancy as possible and monitor her throughout the pregnancy and delivery. An anesthesia consultation should be obtained prior to the onset of labor to discuss options for regional anesthesia or analgesia.</p><p>Levels of VWF rise in normal individuals and in most patients with VWD during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy to two to three times baseline. Consequently, many patients with VWD reach normal levels of both VWF and factor VIII at term. However, the qualitative abnormalities in type 2 VWD will persist, and thrombocytopenia in type 2B VWD may worsen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>].

We use VWF concentrates or antifibrinolytic therapy during pregnancy to treat bleeding or for invasive procedures, with the choice of agent dependent on the degree of bleeding or hemostatic challenge. However, limited data indicate that DDAVP has been used &quot;without mishap&quot; in 31 pregnant women for prophylaxis before invasive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H749874\"><span class=\"h3\">Delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For delivery, the patient should be hospitalized in a center where VWF and factor VIII levels can be monitored. Although treatment is not needed during pregnancy in the majority of women with VWD, many require treatment during delivery and the one to three weeks thereafter. Knowledge of the woman's type of VWD, activity of factor VIII and VWF, current and prior responses to DDAVP, and past bleeding episodes is useful for guiding peripartum therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/66,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,96</a>].</p><p>It is recommended that levels of VWF and factor VIII be maintained at 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/dL</span> or higher during delivery and for at least three to five days after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/4,92,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,92,97</a>]. Since plasma levels of factor VIII and VWF can fall quickly after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>] and excessive bleeding can occur at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>], we suggest the use of VWF concentrates to maintain these levels in the patients whose factor VIII and VWF fall below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span>.</p><p>Regional anesthesia may be considered when VWF and factor VIII levels are maintained at approximately 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. In patients who are known to respond adequately to DDAVP, we give DDAVP after the beginning of labor and as close to the time of delivery as can be estimated. Subsequent doses can be given as needed, at approximately 12-hour intervals for two to four doses.

Cesarean delivery should be reserved for the usual obstetrical indications, because fetal intraventricular hemorrhage due to maternal or fetal VWD is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H749880\"><span class=\"h3\">Postpartum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive bleeding may occur up to 21 or more days following delivery and should be treated with DDAVP or VWF concentrates as appropriate to the bleeding episode.

Thus, continuation of intermittent DDAVP or VWF replacement therapy may be required for the first two to four weeks after delivery.</p><p>Elective surgical procedures on the newborn (eg, circumcision) should be delayed until the infant's VWD and factor VIII status have been determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H748861\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1608667\"><span class=\"h3\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In preparation for any surgery, the hematologist should speak directly with the surgeon to fully understand the procedure and evaluate the potential for bleeding.</p><p>A decision regarding whether to use DDAVP or VWF concentrate for prophylaxis requires a thorough history of the severity of the patient&rsquo;s VWD, past types of bleeding with hemostatic challenges, close observation for bleeding during and after the surgery, and clinician judgment.</p><p>In general, if the patient has responded to a particular agent for a similar hemostatic challenge in the past, then this agent can be used again.
