It is characterized by a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms that includes abdominal distention and discomfort, enlarged ovaries, ascites, and other complications of enhanced vascular permeability. The syndrome can be strictly defined as the shift of serum from the intravascular space to the third space, mainly to the abdominal cavity, in the context of enlarged ovaries due to follicular stimulation. In its very severe form, OHSS is a life-threatening condition.</p><p>The management of OHSS will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and prevention of OHSS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16016168\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OHSS is an iatrogenic and potentially life-threatening condition that affects young, healthy women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, there is an important economic burden associated with OHSS due to absence from work, bed rest, or hospitalization and intensive medical management of severe cases.</p><p>The pathophysiology of OHSS is not fully understood, but increased capillary permeability with the resulting loss of fluid into the third space is its main feature. In the susceptible patient, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration for final follicular maturation and triggering of ovulation is the pivotal stimulus for OHSS, leading to overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the ovary, release of vasoactive-angiogenic substances, increased vascular permeability, loss of fluid to the third space, and full-blown OHSS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66510\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66510 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>There are two clinical forms of OHSS, both hCG related: the early-onset form (occurring on the first eight days after exogenous hCG administration) and the late-onset form (occurring nine or more days after hCG administration, related to pregnancy-induced hCG production) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The main steps include recognizing risk factors, using individualized ovarian stimulation regimens for assisted reproduction, modifying treatment when indicators for increasing OHSS risk develop, and using an alternative to standard-dose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist for final oocyte maturation. These strategies, as well as other interventions that are thought to be ineffective (eg, intravenous albumin), are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16016610\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of established OHSS should be conservative and directed at symptoms; many women can be managed as outpatients. However, women with severe or critical OHSS require hospitalization (in some cases in the intensive care unit [ICU]). OHSS is a self-limited disease, although symptoms may be prolonged if pregnancy has occurred.</p><p>The general approach to managing the patient with OHSS is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101703\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101703 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Our approach is similar to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, and the Joint Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada-Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society, all of whom have published clinical practice guidelines for OHSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16016630\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild OHSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) cases are mild or moderate and can be managed on an outpatient basis. Normally, these cases are self-limited and can be managed conservatively, with a goal of relieving symptoms.</p><p>Mild OHSS is seen in many women undergoing ovarian stimulation for assisted reproduction. For mild OHSS, analgesics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> rather than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and avoidance of heavy physical activity are usually enough. Patients should be instructed to call for any signs or symptoms of worsening (oliguria, abdominal distention, shortness of breath, or weight gain [a sign of fluid accumulation]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F100371\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100371 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101703\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101703 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Mild OHSS can progress to become moderate or severe, particularly if pregnancy has occurred.

Ultrasound-guided culdocentesis is often performed (even on an outpatient basis) in women with tense ascites, orthopnea, rapid increase of abdominal fluid, or any other sign that may indicate progression of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Removal of ascitic fluid provides symptomatic relief; women without other complications can then continue to be monitored as outpatients. </p><p>The volume of fluid to be removed is not well established, but after aspiration of 500 mL of ascitic fluid, patients typically report resolution of abdominal discomfort. In one report of 19 women with OHSS, after aspiration of 2000 mL of ascites, a reduction in intra-abdominal pressure and renal artery resistance was seen, followed by an increase in urine output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Removal of more than 4 liters of fluid is not recommended.

Although isotonic crystalloid solutions (eg, normal saline, Ringer's lactate) are typically used for intravenous hydration in patients with severe OHSS, some clinicians use intravenous albumin in critically ill, volume-depleted patients. However, available evidence suggests that intravenous albumin provides no additional benefit when compared with crystalloid solutions.
