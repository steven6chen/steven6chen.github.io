In most cases, a detailed history and a reliable account of the event by an eyewitness is sufficient to make a diagnosis, but this may not always be available. In addition, certain types of nonepileptic events can be difficult to distinguish from seizures, and certain types of seizures can be misdiagnosed as nonepileptic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>An interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) can provide evidence that helps to confirm or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy, but has many limitations. The most helpful finding on EEG is interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), but this finding has imperfect sensitivity and specificity. For patients with recurrent events and nondiagnostic interictal EEG findings, or lack of response to treatment, EEG monitoring is often required to distinguish epileptic seizures from nonepileptic events (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81289 \">table 1</a>). EEG monitoring can be done in the outpatient setting (ambulatory-EEG monitoring) or in the inpatient setting, with combined continuous video monitoring (video-EEG monitoring).</p><p>This topic discusses the use of EEG monitoring in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy. More detailed discussions of routine EEG, and the use of other diagnostic tests in the evaluation of patients with seizures and epilepsy are presented separately. The differential diagnosis of seizures is also presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electroencephalography (EEG) in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-in-the-evaluation-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging in the evaluation of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonepileptic-paroxysmal-disorders-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AMBULATORY-EEG MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ambulatory-EEG (aEEG) monitoring allows prolonged EEG recording outside the hospital or clinic setting. The technology has evolved such that portable recordings of up to 36 channels, over several days are possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Typically, computer software designed to detect electrographic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) assists in interpretation. However, no program has high specificity and sensitivity, and prolonged segments of the study, ideally the entire study, should be reviewed in their entirety as resources allow. Patients and observers also have the opportunity to &quot;tag&quot; portions of the recording during clinical events using a push button device. Some systems have the added capability of simultaneous electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, polysomnography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> video recording.</p><p>aEEG is less expensive than inpatient video-EEG monitoring, with costs that are 51 to 65 percent lower than a 24-hour inpatient admission for video-EEG monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, inpatient video-EEG has several advantages that make it the gold standard test in differentiating epileptic from nonepileptic seizures. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Video-EEG monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of its longer recording time that generally includes one or more periods of sleep, aEEG can increase the yield of interictal epileptiform detection compared to a routine EEG. One study found that the yield of IED detection after an initially normal routine EEG was greater with a 24-hour aEEG than a sleep-deprived EEG (33 versus 24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In another series, aEEG monitoring for seven days revealed IEDs in 81 percent of 100 adult patients with confirmed epileptic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>However, the sensitivity and specificity of IED detection on aEEG has not been extensively evaluated. Computer algorithms may miss a substantial proportion of IEDs, and many computer-detected &quot;spikes&quot; are not true IEDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one study of 159 adult volunteers without epilepsy, overnight aEEG monitoring revealed spikes in four individuals, two of whom had a family history of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Migraine was also a risk factor for spikes in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ictal recording</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability of aEEG to record clinical events may be an even more important contribution of the technology than IED detection. Clearly, the baseline frequency of clinical events contributes to the yield of aEEG in this regard. In one study of 157 children whose parents reported at least three spells per week, 140 patients (89 percent) had a typical event during aEEG (mean duration 1.9 days); 76 percent of these were suspected to be nonepileptic based on the lack of an EEG correlate on aEEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Other studies in both children and adults have reported a similar yield of aEEG in distinguishing epileptic from nonepileptic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In a large retrospective study of prolonged (up to 96 hours) aEEG recordings (without video), the findings resulted in a significant change in the pre-study diagnosis in 26 percent of patients, and an overall diagnostic yield of 68 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In most cases, changing the diagnosis from epilepsy to probable nonepileptic phenomena, such as syncope or psychogenic nonepileptic attacks.</p><p>An important point is that a definitive diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic attacks can only be made with expert review of video-EEG recordings. Caution should be used when making a diagnosis of nonepileptic phenomena on the basis of EEG findings alone; the majority of focal seizures without impairment of consciousness and a portion of those with impairment of consciousness have no definite scalp EEG correlate. Thus, a negative aEEG study, especially one with events with no definite EEG correlate, should lead to a definitive inpatient video-EEG monitoring session in most cases.</p><p>A finding that has been repeatedly observed in aEEG studies is that patients with epilepsy are often unaware of seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5,8,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,13-15</a>]. In one study, 18 (38 percent) of 47 computer-assisted aEEG recordings contained focal seizures that were not identified by the patient; only 7 of these 18 patients also had self-reported clinical seizures during the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As a result, both ambulatory and video-EEG monitoring may have diagnostic utility despite a low frequency of seizure events reported by a patient. We often use aEEG to help quantify seizure frequency, particularly in patients who are not always aware of their seizures. In addition, we often use 24 to 72 hours of aEEG to confirm lack of seizures before allowing patients to resume driving after a period of apparent seizure freedom. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=driving-restrictions-for-patients-with-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Driving restrictions for patients with seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When electrographic seizures are recorded, the tracing can also help distinguish focal versus generalized seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some studies suggest that aEEG can also help localize the focus of focal epilepsies in patients being considered for surgery and may provide prognostic information in patients being considered for antiseizure drug withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Advances in wireless technology have made it possible to synchronize the EEG recording with a portable video camera to obtain video-EEG recordings at home. While there are no direct data on the diagnostic utility of this technique, reports documenting non-synchronized video recording with ambulatory EEG suggest that video can help with diagnosis of paroxysmal events in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. While in-hospital video-EEG monitoring is safer and more accurate, home video-EEG monitoring may be useful for diagnosing paroxysmal spells in patients who have frequent events, are unable or unwilling to come to the hospital if there is a long wait for inpatient monitoring, or if the cost of inpatient monitoring is prohibitive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28072339\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of recording</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no accepted standard for the duration of aEEG recording, which can range from 24 hours to a week or more, if periodic downloads of information are made. In one large study of prolonged aEEG monitoring, of the patients with interictal epileptiform discharges, 95 percent were identified within the first 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Generalized epileptiform discharges were identified much earlier than focal discharges (median latency 43 minutes for generalized IED versus 576 minutes for focal IED). This suggests that 48 to 72 hours is likely sufficient for detection of IED. For other indications, such as characterization of clinical events and detecting seizures of which the patient is unaware, the duration of recording may be longer or shorter, and should be individualized based on the patient&rsquo;s history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">VIDEO-EEG MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Video electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring is the synchronous recording and display of EEG patterns and video-recorded clinical behavior. Short recordings of several hours can be performed as an outpatient in an EEG laboratory, while longer recordings of 24 hours or more are generally done in a hospital inpatient setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27881599\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages of video-EEG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While considerably more expensive than aEEG, there are several advantages to this test, including the continuous video-monitoring that allows for analysis of both the clinical and electrographic features of a recorded event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staff trained in EEG monitoring may detect seizure activity on remote viewing of the video or EEG at the nursing or monitoring station. They can interact with and test the patient during a spell or seizure aura, and push the event button. This can be very important for characterizing impairment of awareness and subtle lateralizing features, including postictal aphasia or hemiparesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both video and EEG quality are usually superior with inpatient, monitored recordings. Video cameras in inpatient units usually allow infrared viewing of patients in the dark, as well as remote control of the camera, including zooming in as needed, from the nursing or monitoring station. As a result, when a seizure occurs, subtle clinical features with lateralizing importance can be better appreciated, such as dystonic posturing, eye deviation, facial clonus, postictal nose-wiping, brief Todd's paresis, etc. Video can also help identify artifacts produced by nonseizure-related rhythmic movements (blinking, chewing, toothbrushing, scratching) that can mimic seizures on EEG</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrode application can be more frequently monitored and maintained, limiting artifact. Additional electrodes, such as inferior temporal electrodes, are impractical in the outpatient setting, and can be more easily monitored and maintained in the inpatient setting. These electrodes can provide information that would be unavailable from the standard electrode array.

In one case series of 248 adult patients admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit, the median time to first diagnostic event, whether epileptic seizure or nonepileptic event, was two days; 35 percent of patients required three or more days of monitoring, and 7 percent more than one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another series of consecutive patients admitted to a video-EEG monitoring unit for diagnosis of spells, a stay of longer than five days was no less likely to be inconclusive than shorter stays in patients with epileptic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In patients with presumed nonepileptic events, stays longer than five days were more likely to be inconclusive. When a first video-EEG study is not diagnostic, repeat testing can be helpful; in one study a second study was diagnostically useful in 35 of 43 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The duration of recording will depend on the indication: subjects undergoing presurgical evaluation often require a significantly longer period of long-term monitoring to obtain clinically relevant (and previously unreported) information (mean 3.5 days) compared to patients who are being recorded for diagnosis or classification (2.4 and 2.3 days, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27881730\"><span class=\"h2\">Provocative techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of techniques can be used to provoke typical events in the epilepsy monitoring unit:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine activating techniques such as hyperventilation and photic stimulation should be part of any inpatient video-EEG recording session. One group performed hyperventilation for five minutes at a time, every three hours between 6 am and 12 midnight; 25 percent of all recorded focal-onset seizures were activated during hyperventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The seizures provoked during hyperventilation did not differ from spontaneous seizures in characteristics or severity. Another video-EEG monitoring study found that hyperventilation had an activating effect on the EEG only in those who were also undergoing antiseizure drug tapering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Overall, 14 out of 80 patients, most of whom had localization-related epilepsy, had seizures activated by hyperventilation. In this series, patients underwent hyperventilation for six minutes at a time, and this was repeated a mean of 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">times/day</span>.

In one series, patients who were kept awake every second night during video-EEG monitoring did not have more seizures than patients who were allowed to sleep normally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiseizure medications may be withdrawn in order to provoke seizures. Several studies have shown that the rapid reduction of antiseizure drugs during video-EEG monitoring increases the risk of focal seizures and evolution to bilateral convulsive seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

While some experts have advocated gradual withdrawal of one antiseizure drug at a time, reducing each antiseizure drug by 25 to 50 percent of the baseline total daily dose each day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], more rapid reductions may result in a better diagnostic yield [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a survey of adult monitoring units, 69 percent reported tapering medications by at least a third each day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rate of antiseizure drug taper should be adjusted for each patient based upon risk factors for status epilepticus (eg, frequent seizures at baseline, poor seizure control, frequent generalized seizures, prior status epilepticus) and the risk of adverse outcomes associated with seizure clusters and generalized seizures (eg, low bone density, concurrent cardiovascular disease, history of postictal psychosis). Benzodiazepines and barbiturates should be withdrawn at slower rates than other antiseizure drugs because of the high risk of status epilepticus associated with rapid withdrawal of these medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other techniques used during video-EEG monitoring in order to provoke seizures include physical exercise, alcohol consumption, video games and mental and concentration tasks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In one series of 149 adults monitored for a mean duration of five days, adverse events requiring intervention occurred in 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In another series of 507 patients, mostly adults, monitored over 596 video-EEG recording sessions, 44 patients (9 percent) experienced 53 adverse events requiring intervention and resulting in prolonged hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The most common adverse events were status epilepticus (2 percent of all recordings), injuries from falls, vertebral compression fractures, and psychiatric complications including postictal psychosis. Postictal psychosis can present a unique diagnostic challenge in that it may not be evident until well after discharge.</p><p>Safety data in children are similar. In a series of 454 pediatric epilepsy monitoring admissions, status epilepticus was the most frequent adverse event, occurring in 3 percent of all admissions and 6 percent of those with epileptic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Additional adverse events in four patients (2 percent) included fall, symptomatic subdural fluid collection associated with grid placement, hip pain from a seizure, and postictal psychosis.</p><p>Very rarely, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) occurs in epilepsy monitoring units.

Particular attention should be paid to developing a safety protocol when the patient goes to the bathroom, particularly with invasive video-EEG monitoring studies. In one study, three-quarters of all falls in an epilepsy monitoring unit occurred in the bathroom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Nocturnal supervision is an important component of the overall safety plan. This was illustrated by a multicenter study that reviewed 16 SUDEP cases and nine near-SUDEP cases occurring in epilepsy monitoring units, in which SUDEP was much more likely to occur at night (14 out of 16 cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was started within three minutes in all but one of the daytime cardiac arrests but in none of the nighttime arrests. These data emphasize the need for robust nighttime coverage, routine use of oximetry-based alarm systems, and clear CPR contingency plans in inpatient epilepsy monitoring units. One observational study found that early administration of oxygen after a generalized convulsive seizure reduced the likelihood of postictal generalized EEG suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], a pattern that has been associated with an increased risk of SUDEP in some but not all studies.

Approximately 20 percent of patients referred for video-EEG monitoring for medically refractory seizures do not have epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/10,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,43,44</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective review of 213 admissions (from 196 patients) to an inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit, a definitive diagnosis was reached in 88 percent of patients after a median stay of five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 71 percent and excluded in 22 percent of admissions. In patients diagnosed with epilepsy, the median time since the onset of symptoms was 18 years. Perhaps more worrisome was that patients determined not to have epilepsy had been treated with antiseizure drugs (often multiple medications) for an average of nine years. The National Association of Epilepsy Centers guidelines recommend referral for video-EEG monitoring if spells are uncontrolled after one year, or if the patient has failed treatment with two to three antiseizure medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients misdiagnosed with epilepsy are eventually found to have either psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) or (much less frequently) syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>]. It is also well known that some patients with presumed PNES are found to have epileptic seizures on video-EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Some caution is required for interpretation. While the majority of seizures with impaired awareness reveal an ictal EEG correlate, the tracing may be obscured by muscle artifact. Only 15 to 33 percent of focal seizures without impairment of consciousness or seizure auras, which often involve a limited area of cortex, are associated with surface EEG abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Some studies suggest that synchronized seizure activity must involve approximately 10 cm<sup>2</sup> of cortex for it to produce a focal pattern on a scalp EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Frontal lobe seizures may also not be correlated with electrographic abnormalities on an EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

There was more variability in interpretation for psychogenic and physiologic nonepileptic seizures. Limitations of this study that differ from &quot;real-life&quot; use of this test include a forced choice paradigm based on analysis of a single episode and no access to other clinical data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Seizure classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Video-EEG monitoring can also help with seizure classification, which in turn impacts the most appropriate selection of an antiseizure drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/10,42,43,54-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,42,43,54-58</a>]. The clinical history can be misleading in this regard. As examples, a patient with staring spells may have absence seizures or focal seizures with impairment of consciousness, and a patient with generalized convulsions may have focal or generalized epilepsy. Although the presence of an aura strongly suggests partial-onset seizures, one study reported that symptoms interpreted by the patient as a seizure aura (often brief, nonspecific dizziness) occurred in up to 70 percent of those with primary generalized epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>In two case series that compared seizure classification based on an informant's description versus video-EEG monitoring, reclassification occurred in 12 to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. However, it was not clear that this reclassification led to an alteration of treatment strategy in these patients. In contrast, in a study of 40 patients who underwent video-EEG monitoring, newly recognized epileptic seizure types were identified in eight patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/video-and-ambulatory-eeg-monitoring-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Focal seizures with impairment of consciousness in particular were underreported; only 25 percent of patients with such seizures were aware of all seizures; 51 percent failed to document any focal seizures with impairment of consciousness; and 73 percent of all such seizures were unreported. Even focal seizures evolving to bilateral convulsive seizures were often (42 percent) unreported.

EEG also assists in classifying the underlying epileptic syndrome and thereby guides management.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of its longer duration of recording that typically includes one or more periods of sleep, ambulatory EEG (aEEG) monitoring can increase the yield of routine EEG in detecting interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) detection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ambulatory EEG is most helpful in quantifying or capturing clinical events and associating these with the presence or absence of electrographic seizures. However, absence of an EEG correlate does not exclude epilepsy and aEEG cannot &quot;rule out&quot; epileptic seizures. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Ictal recording'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While relatively inexpensive and convenient to perform, the absence of simultaneous high-fidelity video recording, lack of ability to interact and test the patient during a spell, and a higher potential for artifact and misinterpretation are significant disadvantages of ambulatory EEG monitoring compared with inpatient video-EEG recording. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Ambulatory-EEG monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inpatient video-EEG monitoring combines both a video and EEG recording of clinical events, allows ongoing maintenance of video and EEG quality, permits interaction with the patient during or after an event, and allows medication withdrawal in a safer, monitored setting. (See <a href=\"#H27881599\" class=\"local\">'Advantages of video-EEG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Video-EEG is used most commonly to determine whether epilepsy is the cause of recurrent seizure-like events (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Video EEG can also aid in seizure classification, quantification, and determination of patient awareness of their seizures.
