However, there is broad consensus that giftedness cannot be defined solely by an intelligence quotient (IQ) score on a standardized test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. IQ scores do not take into account creativity and practical intelligence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other terms that are used to describe giftedness include &quot;outstanding talent,&quot; &quot;gifted and talented,&quot; and &quot;high-ability.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H6676623\" class=\"local\">'Presentation and characteristics'</a> below and <a href=\"#H708855915\" class=\"local\">'Identification'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The United States Department of Education (DOE) definition for giftedness is widely accepted by researchers and practitioners in the field of giftedness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83643\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83643 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The DOE definition is similar to that provided by the National Association for Gifted Children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the United States, most state boards of education provide definitions for <span class=\"nowrap\">gifted/giftedness,</span> but the definitions may differ from the United States DOE definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The definitions used by individual states are available from the <a href=\"http://www.nagc.org/GiftedByState.aspx&amp;token=W+V6hvKS0rORATNdvWG3U6TFb/2BybASp8RVA/feJPQwC4TBuPPjgg+7LH06rDlb&amp;TOPIC_ID=14351\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Association for Gifted Children</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gifts versus talents</strong> &ndash; &quot;Gifts&quot; and &quot;talents&quot; are two terms central to the discussion of giftedness. Some debate persists about the distinction between the terms. For the purpose of this topic review, we will use the following definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gifts &ndash; Gifts are the skills or abilities that are innate to the individual. Giftedness does not become manifest unless the gift is developed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Talent &ndash; Talent is what the individual develops out of his or her gifts. Talents are the result of learning and experience. In this topic review, we use the term &quot;high ability&quot; interchangeably with &quot;talent.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intellectual giftedness</strong> &ndash; Intellectual giftedness (sometimes called &quot;school-house giftedness&quot;) refers to giftedness in cognitive abilities and academics (eg, language, abstract logical thinking, mathematics).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonintellectual giftedness</strong> &ndash; Nonintellectual giftedness refers to giftedness in nonintellectual domains (eg, music, art, dance, leadership).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&quot;Twice-exceptional&quot;</strong> &ndash; Twice-exceptional is the term used by practitioners in the field of giftedness to describe children with coexisting giftedness and neurodevelopmental or psychiatric conditions (eg, giftedness and learning disability) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6676623\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION AND CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parent of a gifted child may present to the primary care clinician describing characteristics associated with giftedness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83641 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Gifted children typically have high degrees of self-motivation, curiosity, perseverance, and enjoyment in developing and expressing their talents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Children with giftedness also may present with problems at school that the parent attributes to being insufficiently challenged (eg, boredom, inattention, distracting other students, underachievement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Gifted children may underachieve at school for a variety of reasons (eg, fear of failure, desire to fit in with peers, anti-intellectual school atmosphere, poor study habits, coexisting learning disability, and frustration due to boredom) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559401950\"><span class=\"h2\">Developmental characteristics</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advanced domain-general skills and capacity for learning rapidly &ndash;</strong> Gifted children may have obviously advanced skills in language, reasoning, or humor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83641 \">table 2</a>). They may develop their skills quickly and be able to rapidly and intuitively understand concepts or make connections between one concept and another. Young children may have conversational skills and interests more commonly seen in older children and may prefer the company of older children. Older children may acquire academic skills quickly and complain of boredom at school.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Developmental asynchrony</strong> &ndash; Gifted children may be very advanced in some areas but have average or below average skills in others. Parents may state, for example, that the child has highly advanced mechanical skills, math skills, or reasoning skills, but age-appropriate or even delayed handwriting or reading skills.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Gifted children also may have different rates of intellectual, social, and emotional development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, a four-year-old child may have the intellectual skills (eg, thinking, writing, mathematical) of an eight-year-old but age-appropriate social and emotional development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Developmental asynchrony may lead to difficulty finding playmates or may result in expectations of behavioral or social maturity beyond the child's capacity. Both of these situations can lead to frustration and experiences of disappointment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The series of writing samples from a child in a gifted kindergarten class (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83647%7EPEDS%2F83648%7EPEDS%2F83649%7EPEDS%2F83650\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83647 graphicRef83648 graphicRef83649 graphicRef83650 \">figure 1A-D</a>) demonstrates some of these characteristics:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Advanced skills &ndash; The student's advanced writing skills are present before kindergarten. The sample from the beginning of the year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83647\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83647 \">figure 1A</a>) reveals late kindergarten or early grade one writing skills.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapid pace of learning &ndash; The rate of improvement in writing far surpasses what would be expected of a typical kindergarten student. The final writing sample (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83650\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83650 \">figure 1D</a>) is much more sophisticated in text and word complexity than the initial writing sample; it is more characteristic of a grade three (ie, eight- to nine-year-old) student than a student finishing kindergarten. However, spelling skills are more characteristic of a grade two (ie, seven- to eight-year-old) student.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Handwriting skills &ndash; This student's handwriting skills improve over the course of the year. However, some gifted students may not have the same rate of improvement in handwriting skills as they do in cognitive skills, resulting in developmental asynchrony.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drawing skills &ndash; The student's drawing skills are age-appropriate and are not advanced.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559401957\"><span class=\"h2\">Emotional characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gifted children generally have good emotional adjustment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In observational studies, children with intellectual giftedness in the moderate range typically have slightly lower rates of emotional difficulty than those in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. In one systematic review, the overall rate of psychopathology in giftedness was not above the expected level for the population as a whole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, the rate of social-emotional problems among profoundly gifted children (ie, those with intelligence quotient &gt;160) is approximately twice as high as in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The social and emotional adjustment problems of profoundly gifted students appear to be related to difficulty finding a peer group and appropriate academic stimulation.</p><p>Although gifted children generally are well adjusted emotionally, they have particular areas of emotional vulnerability, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/10,13,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,22,23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They may be extremely perfectionistic and have difficulty accepting failure. This can lead to anxiety and avoidance behaviors. Perfectionism can be debilitating, especially if the child is excessively self-critical and unable to celebrate his or her accomplishments, or is motivated by fear of failure or the desire to please others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They may experience their emotions strongly and react to situations that are unnoticed or evoke only mild reactions in age-matched peers (eg, an eight- or nine-year-old child who is saddened by world poverty). They may be more sensitive to criticism and injustice than age-matched peers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They may be moody, explosive, argumentative, or defiant when they cannot reach their goal or when they cannot continue to pursue their area of interest.

In such cases, it can be difficult to identify both the giftedness and the coexisting condition &ndash; giftedness can be &quot;masked&quot; or overshadowed by the other condition and vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Children with coexisting giftedness and other neurodevelopmental conditions may be referred to as &quot;twice exceptional.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H370340910\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p>It is important to differentiate between features of giftedness that mimic other conditions (eg, inattention) and children with giftedness and a coexisting psychiatric condition or developmental disability (ie, &quot;twice exceptionality&quot;) so that appropriate services can be provided.

The developmental asynchrony between the student's strengths and weakness may need to be quite marked for both conditions to be identified. In some cases, a parent or teacher may focus on delays or difficulties in one area (eg, handwriting, phoneme awareness) and overlook indications of giftedness in other areas (eg, mathematics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In other cases, parents or teachers may overlook learning difficulties in a gifted child because they assume that the child's giftedness will compensate for the difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>If the LD is not detected <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> addressed, the gifted student may be discouraged by lack of achievement or lower achievement in the area of weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. He or she may lose confidence and enthusiasm for school.</p><p>Identification of a coexistent LD may be facilitated by using an assessment procedure that compares the gifted student's achievement with <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> intellectual potential rather than the intellectual performance of same-age or same-grade peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Identification practices for LD in the gifted student vary widely. In one synthesis of quantitative research on LD in gifted students, the authors highlight inconsistencies in case identification for both giftedness and LD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These inconsistencies make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the incidence of giftedness and coexistent LD. Identification procedures may use of formal cognitive measures, data gathered through a Responsiveness to Intervention model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], or qualitative review of the student's academic performance.

Children with coexistent ADHD may require treatment with medication <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behavioral therapies in addition to the educational interventions and strategies for giftedness. In contrast, inattention due to boredom or preoccupation with an area of interest is treated by offering an appropriate level of stimulation.</p><p>Whereas inattention due to boredom is purposeful and is recognized by the student if he or she is asked for an explanation, most students with ADHD are not able to explain their inattention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The way in which giftedness is identified may vary depending upon the circumstances. Formal identification of giftedness may be important to determine eligibility for certain education programs, services, or special consideration.</p><p>The identification of giftedness is to some extent culturally determined. The recognition of intelligence, academic success, and talents in nonacademic domains depends upon what types of skills are valued in a given community and what types of skills are valued or fostered by the family. Because these values are different in different communities and cultures, children from certain cultural or linguistic backgrounds may be underrepresented in programs for academic giftedness, particularly if it is identified by intelligence quotient (IQ) score alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12720745\" class=\"local\">'Pitfalls in identification'</a> below.)</p><p>Similarly, nonacademic giftedness (eg, in athletics, leadership, music, or the arts) also may not be identified, depending upon the values and cultural norms of the child's family. Finally, identification procedures can vary according to the cultural norms of the evaluator. Some researchers and practitioners in the field favor a developmental model of giftedness, which states that giftedness can unfold over time and is not a static phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H708855937\"><span class=\"h2\">Intellectual giftedness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neither the United States Department of Education definition of <span class=\"nowrap\">giftedness/high</span> ability nor other definitions of giftedness provide specific guidance for identification of intellectual giftedness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83643\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83643 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Intellectual giftedness generally is identified through a combination of intelligence testing and qualitative measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In the final determination, the informed judgment of educators and psychologists is more important than strict cut-off scores. The reliability and validity of identification is increased by including multiple measures, criteria, and sources of information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131016359\"><span class=\"h3\">Intelligence quotient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple measures are needed to successfully identify intellectual giftedness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the IQ is a central feature of most identification practices. Verbal, analytic, and logical thinking skills, which are measured by intelligence testing, are necessary for intellectual giftedness, but they are not the only skills needed for academic success.

Historically, the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile (an IQ score of 130 or higher) is used as part of the definition of intellectual giftedness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-gifted-child-characteristics-and-identification/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A more nuanced set of definitions is based upon different ranges of IQ scores.
