These patients typically have marked impairments in functioning and high rates of co-occurring medical, mental health, and social problems that need to be addressed.</p><p>With increasing recognition of the substantial patient population with a chronic SUD (addiction), the SUD-treatment model is shifting from episodic to continuing care, based on the chronic care model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In managing patients with chronic SUDs, the patient&rsquo;s clinical status and risk of relapse are monitored systematically and longitudinally. As the patient&rsquo;s addiction waxes and wanes over time (ie, experiences periods of abstinence, relapse, or fluctuations in risk of relapse), the intensiveness and types of treatment are adjusted.</p><p>This topic describes the continuum of care for SUDs, and factors that influence the determination of patients&rsquo; level of care.

Services across the continuum range in intensity from a brief, office-based intervention to around-the-clock inpatient care, with multiple tiers in between. These levels of care differ in the types and intensity of services provided (eg, the number of hours per week, the variety of clinical disciplines involved, the treatment modalities available, and the extent of patient monitoring). Individuals will often move between levels as their clinical status and treatment needs evolve. Treatment is said to be &quot;stepped down&quot; when a patient is transferred from a higher to lower level of care &ndash; for example, after completing a treatment course while maintaining abstinence at the earlier level. Treatment is commonly &quot;stepped up&quot; when the current level of care proves inadequate &ndash; for example, when a patient relapses.</p><p>There are multiple level of care criteria that are used to guide SUD care in public and private United States health care systems (eg, from the American Society of Addiction Medicine&rsquo;s [ASAM], American Association of Community Psychiatrists, and proprietary firms such as Interqual and MCAP); however, there is much agreement across these criteria. As an example, this topic describes the ASAM&rsquo;s &ldquo;Treatment Criteria for Addictive Substance-related and Co-occurring Conditions&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], which includes dimensions for patient assessment, level of care criteria, and principles for matching patients to levels of care based on their clinical status, social circumstances, individual treatment needs, and preferences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78806\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78806 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. ASAM categorizes levels of SUD care as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 0.5 &ndash; Early intervention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 1.0 &ndash; Outpatient services (including opioid treatment programs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 2.1 &ndash; Intensive outpatient services</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 2.5 &ndash; Partial hospitalization services</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 3.1 &ndash; Clinically managed low-intensity residential services</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 3.3 &ndash; Clinically managed population-specific high-intensity residential services</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 3.5 &ndash; Clinically managed high-intensity residential services</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 3.7 &ndash; Medically monitored intensive inpatient services</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level 4.0 &ndash; Medically managed intensive inpatient services</p><p/><p>The term, &ldquo;behavioral health care,&rdquo; is sometimes used to describe care for mental disorders, substance use disorders, and <span class=\"nowrap\">intellectual/developmental</span> disabilities, particularly by accrediting organizations, health insurers, and managed care organizations in the United States. </p><p>An important component of any SUD continuum is facilitation between levels of care. A 2016 analysis of continuing care for adolescents with SUDs found that more assertive approaches can improve the initiation of continued care and a more rapid rate of initiation resulted in attenuation of substance use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LEVELS OF CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levels of substance use disorder (SUD) care based on the American Society of Addiction Medicine level of care criteria are described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438474568\"><span class=\"h2\">Early intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals at risk for an SUD requiring early intervention may be identified in routine screening in primary care, by Employee Assistance Programs, and during DUI assessments. Patients who screen positively typically receive or are referred for a clinical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As an example, identification of patients whose alcohol consumption is greater than the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism threshold for risky use &ndash; a risk factor for health consequences and progression to an alcohol use disorder &ndash; may be followed by a brief intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Efficacy, adverse effects, and administration&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438474583\"><span class=\"h2\">Outpatient care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outpatient treatment is delivered in a variety of office and clinic settings. Services include individual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> group counseling, mutual help groups, pharmacotherapy, access to laboratory and toxicology services, and medical and psychiatric consultation. Other clinical interventions are cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, and contingency management. Telephone emergency services should be continuously available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuing-care-for-addiction-indications-features-and-efficacy#H202097389\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuing care for addiction: Indications, features, and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Treatment modalities'</a>.)</p><p>Medically supervised withdrawal can be provided on an outpatient basis for patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms, a supportive living situation, and the absence of comorbidities or other complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medically supervised opioid withdrawal during treatment for addiction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with an SUD who are not at risk for complicated withdrawal, and who are medically and psychiatrically stable, living in a supportive recovery environment, and are approaching readiness to change are appropriate for outpatient care. Without treatment, this group of individuals would be at high risk for continued use or relapse. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438474862\"><span class=\"h2\">Intensive outpatient programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intensive outpatient programs (IOP) offer a higher level of care than a typical outpatient program. IOPs provide services in a planned format for a minimum of nine hours a week. IOPs can be located in outpatient, partial hospital, or hospital settings; their schedules often include evening and weekend sessions. Clinical services provided include individual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> group counseling, mutual help groups, pharmacotherapy, access to laboratory and toxicology services, medical and psychiatric consultation. Additional services available include family therapy, vocational services, and recreational therapy. Treatment goals are to attain or maintain sobriety, improve functioning, and maintain residence in the community.</p><p>Individuals appropriate for an IOP typically require close monitoring and frequent contact to reduce risk of continued use, relapse, and worsening mental health problems. They may lack awareness of their SUD or be ambivalent about treatment or abstinence. In addition to the SUD, they may have mild psychiatric problems that need monitoring or lack a supportive recovery environment. They would be medically stable and at minimal risk for severe withdrawal. Some may be living at home, while others would be in a residential treatment setting. Examples of IOP participants include individuals with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of failed outpatient treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Co-occurring, poorly controlled depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited social support such as alienated family members or living with other people with a substance use disorder</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438474882\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial hospital programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial hospital programs (PHPs) are similar to IOPs; they share the same modalities and treatment goals, and may consist of the same programming, with PHP patients attending more frequently. PHPs provide a structured, intensive, nonresidential program with at least 20 hours of treatment per week by some definitions, including individual and group counseling, medication management, educational groups, and occupational therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Medical or psychiatric consultation should be available within 8 hours by phone and 48 hours in person, either on site, via referral, or transfer to a higher level of care. </p><p>Participants in a PHP could include individuals with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of failing IOP treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent residential care, stepping down to PHP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple risk factors contributing to a high risk of relapse</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Residential services</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Residential programs provide a 24-hour, drug and alcohol-free environment, along with professional or peer support. Residential care addresses those aspects of patients' prior living environment that contribute to the potential for relapse. The decision to admit a patient to a residential program requires assessment of the patient's readiness to change. In contrast with other levels of care, these programs require a commitment to maintaining abstinence. There are a wide range of public and private-sector residential programs for SUDs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2943010306\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxford House</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxford House is a non-profit network of 1200 houses across the United States for individuals recovering from SUDs (<a href=\"http://www.oxfordhouse.org/&amp;token=HneFtAsfUPj3YgsYN2STEgGE+ASYNkDdGf9fEqPJndq8l3LqZap7uXkKuTLCAI8p&amp;TOPIC_ID=7799\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.oxfordhouse.org</a>). Each house is rented, financially self-supporting, and drug free. Residents live without professional staff or length of stay restrictions, and are free to choose treatment of any type if they wish. In a randomized trial, 150 patients discharged after SUD treatment were assigned to either an Oxford house or treatment as usual. After 24 months, participants living in an Oxford house had a lower rate of relapse (46 versus 65 percent), higher monthly income, and lower incarceration rates compared with the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438474975\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinically managed, low-intensity residential services</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term residential programs are intended to provide transitional support, eg, between inpatient care and independent living, while other programs provide a long-term residence. Programs vary greatly in their staffing, the degree to which treatment is provided, the types of treatment, and their underlying philosophy. Clinically managed, low-intensity residential services are appropriate for individuals who need time in structured sober housing to integrate recovery and coping skills. Low-intensity services can be offered on site or combined with outpatient and intensive outpatient programs. Examples include halfway houses, group homes, and supportive living environments (SLEs) with on-site staff available 24 hours a day.</p><p>Community residential treatment facilities (CRFs) are one example of clinically managed, low-intensity residential services. CRFs provide transitional housing and treatment, often following inpatient treatment. The cost of CRF treatment often must be borne by the patient, though funded CRF services are available through Medicaid programs in some states, through some private payers, and for selected populations (eg, veterans using Veterans Administration services). Lengths of stay vary, but are on the order of weeks to a few months. CRFs themselves vary in their services and philosophy. Three distinct models have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial model &ndash; These residential programs primarily provide psychosocial services such as individual and group therapy, social skills training, and self-help groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive rehabilitative&nbsp;model &ndash; In addition to psychosocial services, these programs provide work training and more specialized services such as recreational and occupational therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive treatment&nbsp;model &ndash; In addition to the services above, these programs provide medical and psychiatric services, including medication treatment, couples and family counseling, and nutrition counseling.</p><p/><p>Observational studies have described CRF residents as well as resident and program characteristics associated with better outcomes. In one large observational study, CRF residents had high rates of unemployment, social isolation, and prior SUD treatment. About 40 percent had a concomitant psychiatric illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In another study of approximately 2800 residents from a nationally representative sample of 88 CRFs, greater motivation for treatment, social and personal resources, and prior involvement with self-help groups were associated with better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. More severe SUDs and co-morbid psychiatric problems were associated with worse outcomes. A third study found that CRFs with a more structured approach to treatment had better retention rates and SUD outcomes than programs with a more generic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438475054\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinically managed, high-intensity residential services</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These programs have been developed to support individuals with significant functional limitations to the degree they require a 24 hour treatment environment to engage in substance abuse treatment and recovery or enhance a stalled recovery program. These programs have 24 hour per day nursing care, 16 hours per day counselor availability, and physician services for medical and psychiatric problems as needed. </p><p>These programs are typically indicated for individuals with significant cognitive difficulties that cannot be managed without some type of rehabilitative services. Examples of individuals requiring this care include those with a substance-induced neurocognitive disorder or a comorbid neurocognitive disorder.</p><p>Therapeutic communities traditionally provide residential care for substance-dependent individuals, though the model has been applied to other levels of care and clinical conditions as well. The programs are highly structured, provide comprehensive services, and are based on an explicit set of principles, including a focus on the community as a means of facilitating individual change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Treatment goals include changes in identity and lifestyle, including abstinence from substances, employment, cessation of antisocial behavior, and prosocial values. Lengths of stay are typically between 15 and 24 months. Most patients who enter therapeutic communities have extensive substance-use histories and significant psychosocial dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438475106\"><span class=\"h2\">Medically managed intensive inpatient services</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inpatient care mainly provides medically supervised withdrawal for substance-dependent individuals with 24-hour patient care and daily physician visits over brief lengths of stay (eg, two to five days). Medically supervised withdrawal (previously called detoxification) consists of close monitoring and treatment of withdrawal symptoms with medication to diminish their severity. Substances with withdrawal syndromes that can be effectively treated include alcohol, benzodiazepines, other <span class=\"nowrap\">sedatives/hypnotics,</span> and opiates. In contrast, cessation of cocaine, amphetamines, and marijuana can be followed by withdrawal symptoms but absent other medical complications, there are no established treatment protocols for these symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medically-supervised-opioid-withdrawal-during-treatment-for-addiction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medically supervised opioid withdrawal during treatment for addiction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Medically supervised withdrawal takes place either in freestanding treatment centers or, for medically complicated patients, in hospitals. Inpatient programs usually include group treatment that provides education and support. Medication to prevent relapse may be started during an inpatient stay.</p><p>Until recent years, inpatient stays were often longer and included both medically supervised withdrawal and rehabilitation (ie, psychosocial treatment focused on preventing relapse). Clinical trials demonstrated that selected populations could be treated at lower, less resource-intensive levels of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], reserving inpatient treatment for more severe, medically or psychiatrically complicated cases of withdrawal. Far fewer patients receive inpatient rehabilitation today. More commonly, the rehabilitative phase of treatment that follows medically supervised withdrawal is provided at a lower level of care following inpatient discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22949377\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research studies have suggested that clinical outcomes of patients with a substance use disorder (SUD) can be improved by serial, multi-dimensional assessments of the patient&rsquo;s clinical status and needs, and ongoing matching of treatment modalities and levels of care to assessment results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Reassessment of the treatment plan over time and use of evidence-based therapies (such as contingency management, case management and therapeutic communities) are central to achieving optimal outcomes. </p><p>The determination of a patient's level of care should be made by a clinician familiar with services available and based on careful, thorough, and individualized assessment of the patient. The American Society of Addiction Medicine organizes this assessment into specific dimensions, described below, along with clinical questions that can be useful in assessing each dimension. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dimension 1 &ndash; Acute intoxication and withdrawal potential.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Need for management of intoxication (eg, treatment for acute alcohol poisoning; prevent from driving)?

Testing of the matching process via clinical trials is challenging and the results have been mixed. </p><p>Determination of the patient&rsquo;s initial and subsequent levels of care involves synthesis of his or her status in each dimension, the interaction among dimensions, and the types and intensity of services available at each level. Additional factors contributing to the determination are imminent risks requiring immediate attention (eg, suicidality) as well as specific patient needs and preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Level of care criteria such as the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria provide a structured approach to the <span class=\"nowrap\">assessment/determination</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F100475\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100475 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22949377\" class=\"local\">'Patient assessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Levels of care'</a> above.) </p><p>The ASAM matrix utilizes a rating of 0 to 4 across each of the dimensions with 0 = no need for specific services and 4 = high intensity services. The dimension with a highest risk rating identifies the need for immediate treatment. As an example, if there is a risk of severe alcohol withdrawal including seizures or delirium tremens in Dimension 1, a referral for inpatient medically monitored withdrawal would be indicated. Further assessment of other dimensions would take place following admission and stabilization. If there is no immediate danger, the level of risk should be assessed in each dimension. </p><p>As an example, an individual with a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, who presents homeless, with an alcohol use disorder, and a mild exacerbation of psychotic symptoms (but not to the degree of requiring inpatient psychiatric hospitalization or medically supervised withdrawal) would require a moderate intensity of mental health services including case management, medication management, and medical monitoring. The substance use disorder could be addressed in enhanced addiction services or an integrated mental <span class=\"nowrap\">health/substance</span> abuse program if available. Temporary supportive living may be necessary at the onset. Care could be stepped down to assertive case management or outpatient care following reassessment after stabilization on medication. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22949972\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary care referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A primary care physician with particular expertise might treat the patient in the primary care setting with brief counseling and medications as appropriate.

Three months after admission, participants who were undertreated, for example receiving regular outpatient care rather the recommended intensive outpatient, had worse drinking outcomes compared with matched treatment.

Twenty-two percent of patients were treated at a recommended level of care, while 49 percent were undertreated and 29 percent overtreated. Patients who received a recommended level of care did not have better outcomes, assessed after a mean of 9.7 months, than patients treated at a less intensive level (success rates of 43.9 versus 38.3 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A double-blind, multisite, prospective cohort study of 261 individuals seeking treatment in Norway for a SUD examined the prospective validity of the ASAM criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], comparing the outcomes of patients who were treated at a level of care at or more intensive than their criteria-based assessment (&ldquo;matched&rdquo; or &ldquo;overmatched&rdquo;) with patients who were treated at a level of care less intensive than their criteria based assessment (&ldquo;undermatched&rdquo;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Compared with &ldquo;undermatched&rdquo; patients, <span class=\"nowrap\">&ldquo;overmatched/matched&rdquo;</span> patients were more likely to remain in treatment (45 versus 70 and 62 percent), report less alcohol and cannabis use at three months post-placement compared with baseline, and show greater reductions on the Addiction Severity Index.</p><p/><p>Structural factors other than level of care criteria often influence patient placement, including insurance restrictions and the availability of individual levels of care, both of which vary widely across plans and systems of care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT INTEGRATION FOR CO-OCCURRING CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most recent version of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] emphasize the availability of treatment for co-occurring mental disorders and medical conditions in conjunction with substance use disorder (SUD) care, because higher rates of these conditions are seen in patients with SUD compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Integration of care for SUD, mental disorders, and medical conditions at each level of care is generally recommended rather than parallel treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H1238108595\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder#H3412253805\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder&quot;, section on 'Integrated treatment'</a>.)</p><p>SUD-treatment programs vary markedly in their capacity to treat these comorbidities. A recent standardized assessment of 180 community addiction programs across 11 states including outpatient, intensive outpatient, and residential treatment programs found only approximately 20 percent were capable of delivering integrated or dual-diagnosis services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Some programs do not accept patients with active mental disorders or medical conditions. Other programs do not have staff capable of treating these conditions but permit patients to receive concurrent medical or psychiatric care outside the program. Many partial-hospital and intensive-outpatient programs provide psychiatric <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical treatment as an integral part of their program. A minority of systems of care have integrated programs at each level of care for treatment of dual diagnoses. Increased service capacity for the dually diagnosed is clearly needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment model for <span class=\"nowrap\">chronic/relapsing</span> substance use disorders (SUD) in the United States is shifting from episodic treatment to continuing care, based on the chronic disease model.
