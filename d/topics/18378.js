Urogenital TB occurs in 2 to 20 percent of individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Among patients with miliary disease, hematogenous seeding of the urogenital tract occurs in 25 to 62 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one review including more than 9000 patients with TB, urogenital TB affected two males to each female, with a mean age of 40 years (range 5 to 90 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Issues related to urogenital TB are reviewed here; issues related to pulmonary and other forms of TB are discussed separately.

The classical presentation occurs most commonly; it primarily involves the urinary collecting system (including renal pelvis, calyces, ureters, and bladder). Less commonly, renal parenchymal lesions occur, including interstitial nephritis and glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Classical presentation</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong> Mycobacterial seeding of the urogenital tract via hematogenous spread can occur at the time of pulmonary infection or in the setting of reactivation or miliary disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Tuberculous bacilli may enter the medullary interstitium and cause formation of granulomas. These may heal with associated fibrosis (in the absence of overt renal disease) or, many years after initial infection, may break down and rupture into the tubular lumen with excretion of tuberculous bacilli into the urinary tract, leading to continuous spread of infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114045 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsequently, destruction of renal papilla can lead to abscess formation. Descending spread of infection to the ureter and bladder causes ureteral stricture and obstruction, hydronephrosis, and renal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Bladder fibrosis and contraction may occur, resulting in distortion of the ureterovesical junction with lateral displacement and enlargement of the ureteral orifice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Unilateral kidney involvement is generally more common than bilateral involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. However, both kidneys may be involved, which may result in end-stage renal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bilateral renal tuberculosis may occur via three mechanisms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hematogenous spread initially affects one kidney with descending spread to the ipsilateral ureter and bladder. As a result of the fibrosis and contraction of the bladder, patients secondarily develop contralateral vesicoureteral reflux with retrograde spread to the contralateral kidney.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hematogenous spread to both kidneys. This occurs in patients with immunodeficiency and miliary tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reactivation of bilateral renal foci, with descending spread to the collecting system and bilateral ureteral strictures, in the absence of bladder contraction. This presentation is extremely rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal parenchymal lesions</strong> <strong>&ndash;</strong> Rare conditions associated with TB include interstitial nephritis and glomerulopathies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The pathogenesis of TB-associated interstitial nephritis is not clear. At least in some cases, interstitial nephritis may be an immunologic phenomenon caused by TB involvement of other organs rather than the direct result of TB infection in the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a case series from the United Kingdom that included 17 patients of Asian descent who had known TB and underwent a renal biopsy, chronic granulomatous interstitial nephritis was present in all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, although the biopsy showed interstitial inflammation with eosinophilia and granulomas, none of the biopsy specimens was positive for acid-fast stain or mycobacterial culture; in addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for mycobacterial DNA in all five cases in which it was tested.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Interstitial nephritis that develops after the initiation of antituberculous therapy may be attributable to a paradoxical response (ie, the development of new lesions or the worsening of existing lesions after initiation of therapy), which may occur as a result of improved immunologic function resulting in an increase in inflammatory response to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Acute allergic interstitial nephritis may also occur as a result of drugs used to treat TB, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis&quot;, section on 'Drugs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are a number of case reports of patients with glomerulonephritis associated with TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Glomerulonephritis appears to be directly related to TB infection of the kidney. In a retrospective study including 46 Chinese patients with tuberculous glomerulonephritis, a positive urine mycobacterial culture was observed in 20 percent of cases, and renal biopsy was PCR positive for TB in 85 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Seventy-six percent had a history of pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">TB can cause renal amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Amyloidosis is a glomerular lesion that results from amyloid deposition in the kidney (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal amyloidosis&quot;</a>). In TB, renal amyloidosis is due to chronic inflammation, with high circulating levels of the acute-phase reactant, serum amyloid A protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340670427\"><span class=\"h2\">Genital tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberculosis affects the entire male genital tract, including the prostate, seminal vesicles, vas deferens, epididymis, testicles, Cooper glands, and penis. Genital TB occurs via hematogenous spread to the prostate and epididymis or via the urinary tract to the prostate with spread from the ejaculatory ducts to the seminal vesicles, vas deferens, and epididymis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Tuberculosis of the female genital tract usually occurs via hematogenous spread from the lungs; less commonly, it occurs via lymphatic spread from other abdominal organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Tuberculosis affects the fallopian tubes, endometrium, and ovaries but generally spares the myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Primary TB of the female genital tract can develop after sexual intercourse with a man with TB of the penis or epididymis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Female-to-male sexual transmission of TB has not been described in the literature.</p><p>Vertical transmission of tuberculosis is rare; risk factors include maternal extrapulmonary, miliary and meningeal tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Transmission may occur transplacentally via the umbilical veins to the fetal liver and lungs or via aspiration of infected amniotic fluid. The risk of vertical transmission may be reduced via administration of maternal antituberculous therapy.

The average period between pulmonary infection and clinical manifestations of urogenital TB is 22 years (range 1 to 46 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3497819456\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal and urologic tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An understanding of the pathogenesis of infection is important for understanding the range of clinical manifestations of renal and urologic tuberculosis.

Once the disease has progressed to involve the bladder, symptoms of frequency, dysuria, urgency, and nocturia occur in approximately half of cases; gross hematuria and low back pain develop in one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/1,6,7,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7,24</a>]. Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss) are relatively rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. Manifestations of advanced disease include end-stage renal disease and, rarely, refractory hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>HIV-infected patients are younger and more prone to developing tuberculous kidney and prostate abscess than HIV-uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In one series including 24 patients with urogenital TB, HIV infection was present in two-thirds of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Another study including 46 patients with AIDS noted bilateral renal granuloma at autopsy in 24 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Characteristic laboratory findings include persistent pyuria and acidic urine in the setting of urine cultures that are repeatedly negative for pyogenic organisms. Painless macroscopic or microscopic hematuria is present in more than 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The plasma creatinine concentration is usually normal in the setting of unilateral renal involvement. An elevated plasma creatinine concentration may be observed in the setting of bilateral renal involvement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the setting of interstitial nephritis or glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patients with interstitial nephritis are likely to have white blood cell casts.

False-negative results may occur in the setting of concomitant antituberculous or antibacterial therapy capable of inhibiting mycobacterial growth (particularly fluoroquinolones) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A positive urine acid-fast stain is not diagnostic for TB, since nontuberculous mycobacteria may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The threshold for urine acid-fast stain is 5000 organisms per mL; it has sensitivity of 42 to 52 percent and specificity of 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/2,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine PCR &ndash; Urine PCR has sensitivity of 87 to 100 percent and specificity of 93 to 98 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/2,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,33-35</a>]. Some individual laboratories offer validated PCR testing; thus far, there is no commercial PCR test approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for detection of mycobacterial nucleic acid in urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Data on use of the GeneXpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> molecular system for diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB are limited. One study of 91 urine samples from patients with suspected TB or nontuberculous mycobacteria infections (including five culture-positive samples) noted sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 98 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p>Radiographic imaging is also warranted for patients with suspected renal or urologic TB. Radiographic tools include computerized tomography (CT) with contrast and high-resolution ultrasound; either may be used based on availability and center preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/6,37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,37-40</a>]. CT provides greater anatomic detail so is preferable when feasible.</p><p>In general, radiographic evidence of concomitant upper and lower urinary tract involvement is strongly suggestive of TB. Strictures throughout the collecting system (from the renal pelvis to the ureterovesical junction) are observed in 60 to 84 percent of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64772\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64772 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urogenital-tuberculosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The selection of biopsy site depends on the predominant clinical features and radiographic findings. Biopsy specimens should be sent for histopathological examination, stain for acid-fast bacilli, and mycobacterial culture.</p><p>Patients who have evidence of interstitial nephritis or glomerulonephritis (ie, an active urinary sediment and elevated plasma creatinine concentration) commonly undergo renal biopsy even in the absence of clinical features suggestive of TB.

These may heal with associated fibrosis (in the absence of overt renal disease) or, many years after initial infection, may break down and rupture into the tubular lumen with excretion of tuberculous bacilli into the urinary tract, leading to continuous spread of infection. Descending spread of infection to the ureter and bladder causes ureteral stricture and obstruction, hydronephrosis, and renal dysfunction.
