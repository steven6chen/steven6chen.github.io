It is likely that patients with metastatic breast cancer will receive many (if not all) of these treatments throughout the course of their disease. However, below we illustrate the principles that can guide the choice of therapy in the first- or later-line setting. Given that currently available systemic treatments for metastatic breast cancer are not curative, we encourage participation in well-designed clinical trials. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454788372\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor burden</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor burden (the extent of disease detected on imaging or clinical exam <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of tumor-related symptoms) can impact on whether single-agent chemotherapy or a combination regimen is administered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prefer the sequential use of single-agent chemotherapy, especially for patients with a limited tumor burden <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limited or minimal cancer-related symptoms. Sequential single-agent treatment is often less toxic and results in similar overall survival compared with combination chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-breast-cancer-in-women-chemotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Appropriate patients include those with symptomatic disease due to the location of specific metastatic lesions (eg, right upper quadrant pain due to expanding liver metastases, or dyspnea related to diffuse lung metastases) and a large tumor burden, as well as those with rapidly progressive disease.

RECIST primarily applies to imaging of metastatic disease, and it encompasses two of the three reasons for treatment failure. </p><p>According to RECIST, disease progression on imaging is defined as any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 20 percent or more increase in the sum of measurable target lesions compared with the smallest sum previously recorded </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appearance of any new lesions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worsening of existing non-target lesions, for example, bone metastases </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2191622582\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the gains in early detection, up to five percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer have metastatic disease at the time of first presentation. In addition, up to 30 percent of women with early-stage, non-metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis will develop distant metastatic disease. Although metastatic breast cancer is unlikely to be cured, meaningful improvements in survival have been seen, coincident with the introduction of newer systemic therapies. (See <a href=\"#H2191620277\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of treatment of metastatic breast cancer are to prolong survival and improve quality of life by reducing cancer-related symptoms. In order to achieve these goals an individualized approach is needed since no one strategy can be applied for all women. (See <a href=\"#H117388102\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)<br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer, chemotherapy is currently the only standard option for treatment of metastatic breast cancer because they are not candidates for endocrine or HER2-directed therapy. (See <a href=\"#H117388102\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, endocrine therapy with inclusion of a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> inhibitor in either the first or second line is the preferred treatment. However, we suggest chemotherapy if the disease is rapidly progressive, and the patient is at risk for organ failure if a rapid response is not achieved (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H117388102\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom chemotherapy is recommended, the choice of regimen (ie, single-agent or a combination) and selection of a specific therapy depends on multiple factors, including the tumor burden (both in tumor volume and the presence of disease-related symptoms), general health status, prior treatments and toxicities, and patient preferences. These factors can help in the formulation of an individualized treatment plan in the first- or later-line setting. (See <a href=\"#H454788364\" class=\"local\">'Factors influencing chemotherapy choice'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a limited tumor burden <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limited or minimal cancer-related symptoms, we suggest single-agent chemotherapy administered sequentially rather than combination chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2993542\" class=\"local\">'Single-agent chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For select patients with symptomatic disease due to the location of specific metastatic lesions (eg, right upper quadrant pain due to expanding liver metastases, or dyspnea related to diffuse lung metastases) and a large tumor burden, we suggest a combination regimen rather than a single-agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Combination therapy results in a greater likelihood of a response compared with single-agent therapy, which may be of a sufficient benefit to justify the risks of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H99380180\" class=\"local\">'Combination chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful assessment for response to treatment requires serial clinical examination, repeat lab evaluation (including tumor markers), and radiographic imaging. (See <a href=\"#H101968463\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike in the adjuvant setting, there is no predetermined duration of treatment. For the young patient with ER-negative disease who is responding to treatment, we continue chemotherapy beyond best response. However, for patients who experience side effects to treatment or prefer not to continue treatment for whatever reason, discontinuation of treatment is reasonable. Patients with ER-positive disease who received chemotherapy in the first line may consider switching to endocrine therapy for maintenance treatment. (See <a href=\"#H453567572\" class=\"local\">'Duration of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some criteria that we use to define treatment failure include any of the following: clinical deterioration during treatment (ie, increasing disease-related symptoms, intolerable treatment toxicity, a decline in performance status), appearance of new metastases, and increasing size of previously documented metastatic lesions.
