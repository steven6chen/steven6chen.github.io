Complications are more common when synthetic mesh is used for the surgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse compared with stress urinary incontinence (SUI), although SUI surgery is performed more frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A systematic review of 11 trials and 9 studies reported the following additional risk factors for mesh-related complication: operative technique, surgeon experience, previous prolapse repair, concomitant hysterectomy, total mesh repair, mesh properties, young age, sexual activity, and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1666592170\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While mesh complications can occur following surgery for both pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI), mesh-related complications are more common following POP surgery, particularly when the synthetic mesh is placed vaginally. As a result of the disparate complication rates for the two procedure groups, the US Food and Drug Administration reclassified surgical mesh for transvaginal POP repair as a class III (ie, high-risk) device in 2016, but kept the class II classification for transvaginal mesh used in the surgical treatment of SUI and for transabdominal mesh for POP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

A different study that followed nearly 600 women randomly assigned to either a retropubic or transobturator sling for up to 24 months reported synthetic mesh complications in approximately 4 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Complications from mesh-based surgery for prolapse or incontinence can occur any time postoperatively and continue to rise over time. Examples of early and remote synthetic mesh complications for prolapse and anti-incontinence procedures are highlighted by the studies below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of nearly 28,000 women undergoing prolapse surgery, 3 percent of women who had transvaginal mesh prolapse repair required reintervention within one year, although 2 percent of women who did not receive transvaginal mesh also underwent reintervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The risk of reintervention was greatest for the women under age 65 years who received transvaginal mesh compared with similarly aged women who did not receive transvaginal mesh (hazard ratio 1.76).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective cohort study including nearly 60,000 women who underwent a mesh-based procedure for SUI, the risk of complication requiring reintervention was 1.2 percent at one year and cumulatively increased to 3.3 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, 10 years after SUI surgery, 1 of every 30 women required a second procedure for mesh-related complications. In this study, complications were defined as mesh exposure, fistula, pain, or urinary retention.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H641008892\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF MESH-RELATED COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key points for preventing complications from synthetic mesh, regardless of procedure indication, are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimize modifiable risk factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use most recent scientific evidence regarding the biomechanical properties of the material to select the transvaginal mesh type </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use optimal surgical technique</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2128040136\"><span class=\"h2\">Modifiable risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical therapy is adjusted to optimize the medical condition. In addition to smoking cessation, common gynecologic conditions relevant to successful pelvic floor surgery include pelvic floor dysfunction and vaginal atrophy or ulcerations.

Active tobacco users have a 5.2- and 3.2-fold increased risk of mesh exposure following sacrocolpopexy and vaginal mesh, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Concerning history includes symptoms of urgency, frequency, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, and sexual abuse; suggestive physical examination findings include abnormal pelvic tone or sensation during palpation of the levators, obturator internus, vaginal sulci, and vulva. In one cohort study, 33.5 percent of women (105 of 324) had dyspareunia at the time of questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with abnormal findings are referred for treatment of the underlying condition. In addition, they are explicitly informed that surgery, if undertaken, is not meant to improve these symptoms and may make them worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bariatric surgery &ndash;</strong> A case-control study reported that women who had previous bariatric surgery were at seven times greater odds of mesh exposure following a midurethral sling compared with women without bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Optimization of nutritional deficiencies prior to the sling may be beneficial in minimizing mesh exposure in this population of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaginal atrophy and ulceration</strong> &ndash; Preoperatively, the authors treat patients with topical estrogen until the symptoms resolve and then continue local estrogen therapy postoperatively. While this approach is common practice, the ability of vaginal estrogen to reduce mesh complications has been questioned by a retrospective cohort study and a small prospective trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Meshes with microporous components (pore size &lt;10 microns) or with multifilament weave are avoided because of increased risk of mesh-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These materials undergo an encapsulation response and are more prone to exposure, sinus tract formation, and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

The surgical training should include specific education in recognition of mesh-related complications. There is evidence that complications are higher among providers with less experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a study of 198 patients treated with surgical correction using mesh, the experienced surgeon had fewer exposures than the less experienced surgeons (2.9 versus 15.6 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Full thickness dissection</strong> &ndash; A &quot;full thickness&quot; dissection is done via hydrodissection with development of a deeper surgical plane that leaves the pubocervical connective tissue attached to the epithelium. The rationale is to maintain vascular supply to the epithelium and improve healing, with the goal of diminishing graft exposure. In contrast, in traditional plication the vaginal epithelium is separated from the underlying pubocervical connective tissue, which is subsequently plicated in the midline with a delayed absorbable suture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tension-free mesh suspension</strong> &ndash; The mesh needs to be inserted in a tension-free fashion.

The etiology is unclear but could include mesh shrinkage or inadvertent overtightening at the time of insertion. Following correct placement of transvaginal mesh, there will still be persistent laxity of the vaginal wall to allow for mesh contraction during the postoperative period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention of mesh rolling or bunching</strong> &ndash; The mesh body needs to be trimmed and secured to the underlying tissue to prevent rolling or bunching, as this phenomenon has been observed in patients who experience mesh exposure and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183640507\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS BY PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common complications are mesh exposure, mesh contraction (shrinkage of the mesh), pain (including dyspareunia and associated with contracture), infection, urinary problems, bleeding, and organ perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>].

The etiology of these symptoms is often not clear, but scarring, graft exposure, or graft contraction may be contributing factors. In a survey study of 160 women who underwent multiple types of pelvic mesh procedures, factors associated with self-reported pain one year postoperatively included younger age (mean 57 versus 63 years), fibromyalgia, worse physical health, higher somatization, and lower surgery satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].
