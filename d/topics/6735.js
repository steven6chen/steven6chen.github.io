There often are no associated symptoms other than the recognition of a new &quot;lump&quot; noted incidentally on palpation while grooming or noticed by another individual. The mass may be the only manifestation of a serious and potentially malignant pathology, especially in the adult population. </p><p>Evaluation of the neck mass must be approached in a thorough and disciplined manner. A thorough history and physical examination are essential first steps in the evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This will narrow the diagnostic possibilities and help determine the appropriate next diagnostic steps.</p><p>The diagnostic approach to evaluation of a neck mass in <strong>adults</strong> will be reviewed here.

An occupational history, occupational exposures, animal exposures, and recent travel history should also be included.</p><p>Although smoking rates have decreased in the United States, with a consequent drop in the number of diagnosed oral cavity and laryngeal cancers, the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has markedly increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC have a distribution of demographic characteristics that is distinct from those with tobacco- or alcohol-related head and neck cancer. Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC are most commonly Caucasian men, nonsmokers, younger than 65 years, and with few comorbidities. They are typically of high socioeconomic status and have risk factors for HPV exposure several decades prior to presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>A large database analysis by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that over 11,000 cases of OPSCC were diagnosed yearly in the United States between 2004 and 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This study was repeated for the years 2008 through 2012 and found that the incidence had increased to over 16,000 cases per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Further, based on a CDC genotyping study, currently 70 percent of all OPSCCs are HPV associated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Extrapolating from these data, the incidence of HPV-associated OPSCC increases each year by over 700 cases in the United States, with the yearly incidence in HPV-associated OPSCC likely to exceed 16,000 cases in 2020.</p><p>Most importantly, in over two-thirds of cases, this disease will present as an asymptomatic neck mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. For this reason, there are often several barriers to timely and accurate diagnosis in these patients. In a study of 208 patients with HPV-associated OPSCC, an asymptomatic neck mass was the initial presentation in 69 percent. In almost 10 percent of patients, however, the time interval between first presentation and diagnosis was over one year. These diagnostic delays were due to either clinician- or patient-related factors. Clinician-related factors included delay in referral from primary care physicians or misdiagnosis by otolaryngologists. Patient-related factors included delay in seeking care or noncompliance with diagnostic workup, which in large part is due to the asymptomatic nature of small or unknown primary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For these reasons, it is imperative that patients with an asymptomatic neck mass undergo timely and thorough diagnostic workup along with prompt specialist referral when indicated.</p><p>HPV-associated OPSCC is discussed in further detail in another topic.

Imaging options include ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and combined positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> fusion scans. Contrast CT should be the initial study of choice for most adult patients with a neck mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound evaluation of a neck lesion is more commonly used in Europe than in the United States (US). Greater experience has developed in the US for axial imaging by CT and MRI scanning. CT and MRI allow for the characterization of the mass and its relation to normal anatomic structures of the head and neck and may also help in identifying a primary source when metastatic disease is present. Angiographic imaging variants can be obtained with both study techniques (CTA or MRA), which may be helpful in evaluating masses of possible vascular origin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3483949064\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The least invasive of the imaging techniques is ultrasound. Advantages of ultrasound include its noninvasive nature, real-time assessment of the mass and its relation to adjoining structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>], and the ability to easily guide fine-needle aspiration. Ultrasound is an excellent initial imaging modality for those at low risk of malignant disease, such as thyroid nodules without clinical evidence of extrathyroidal invasion or rapid growth. Ultrasound is also useful in those who wish to avoid the ionizing radiation of CT, such as in younger patients or those who require frequent surveillance imaging. Additionally, it is a relatively inexpensive imaging modality, with the current cost of a diagnostic neck ultrasound approximately $120 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>There are several disadvantages to ultrasound, however, including dependence on operator expertise and limited permanent images for use in consultant evaluation or the operative setting. Interobserver reliability in neck ultrasound is variably reported in the literature and focuses largely on the interpretation of thyroid nodules. In an evaluation of 365 patients with clinically suspected thyroid lesions all separately scanned by six ultrasonographers, interobserver reliability was excellent and increased with experience of the observer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Not all studies, however, have shown such a high degree of interobserver agreement, particularly in nodule margin and echogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Caution should be used when making conclusions about changes in the size or character of a mass over time, especially with interfacility ultrasound comparison, as different ultrasound systems may produce significant differences in image quality and interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical utility of ultrasonography in thyroid disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3698253538\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT is well tolerated by patients, and reformatting algorithms allow evaluations in all relevant planes. It also yields excellent bone detail and is the study of choice for neck masses arising from or adjacent to bony structures. Image acquisition is fast, and the cost of CT is not substantially higher than that of ultrasound, with the price of contrast-enhanced neck CT approximately $240 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is an excellent initial diagnostic study in patients at higher risk of malignancy, or those with possible involvement of deep neck spaces, particularly those poorly visualized by ultrasound, including parapharyngeal and masseteric spaces.</p><p>A limitation of CT scan is its use of ionizing radiation. A typical head and neck CT imparts a radiation dose of approximately 4 mSv [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, annual background radiation from natural sources in the US is approximately 3 mSv, with substantial regional variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In that way, a single CT scan has a negligible effect on a patient's lifetime incidence of developing malignancy. Consideration of the ionizing effects of CT scanning should only affect management decisions in pediatric patients, who may be at an increased risk of radiation-induced malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and in patients undergoing very frequent surveillance imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H816300008\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI is indicated for masses that require further definition of soft tissue (eg, infiltrative soft tissue masses, suspicion of malignant perineural spread, or potential central nervous system origin). Advantages of MRI include outstanding soft tissue differentiation, lack of ionizing radiation, and infrequent contrast allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/28,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,41</a>]. Imaging acquisition for MRI takes longer than CT and may be challenging for claustrophobic patients. MRI is also more expensive than both ultrasound and CT, with the price of a contrast-enhanced <span class=\"nowrap\">orbits/face/neck</span> MRI approximately $420 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550660363\"><span class=\"h2\">Positron emission tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> fusion scans have been found useful in the setting of malignancy, aiding in the identification of primary disease, or detection of distant metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is primarily helpful in the later evaluation of malignancies and plays little role in the initial evaluation of the neck mass. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanning does impart a significantly high equivalent radiation dose, which may be as high as 32 mSv and, with frequent scanning, may appreciably increase the lifetime attributable risk of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The initial cytopathological analysis of FNA is by smear preparation, which may be limited by blood products, hypocellularity, and variable smear thickness. The addition of cell block preparation to standard cytopathological analysis has been shown to reduce the rate of unsatisfactory samples and improve diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Cell blocks are prepared by centrifugation of material obtained through FNA, which can then be sectioned for further pathological analysis, including immunohistochemical staining. This can be especially useful in certain pathologies, including lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] and HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In particular, FNA is an important initial diagnostic tool in patients at risk for lymphoma. Even if initial needle biopsy is unable to provide exact subtype definition, FNA can quickly rule out carcinoma or other pathology in these patients and identify those who would benefit from excisional biopsy. Cell block preparations may also be archived for future analysis or use in research protocols.</p><p>Besides cytologic analysis, FNA aspirate can also be submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for virus such as the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which can suggest the diagnosis of a nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or the human papilloma virus (HPV), which has been implicated in OPSCC. </p><p>FNA is a safe, highly accurate diagnostic procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/45,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,50,51</a>] but is dependent upon the skills of the clinician performing the procedure to avoid sampling errors and the accuracy of cytopathological interpretation. A meta-analysis found an overall accuracy of 93 percent (ranged 73 to 98 percent) for FNA in diagnosing all neck masses regardless of location or histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>The isolated lateral neck cyst in an adult, however, remains a diagnostic challenge. As discussed above, in patients over 40 years, lateral neck cysts may represent cervical metastasis from HPV-associated OPSCC. In these masses, the cyst lining is often the only diagnostic component, which decreases the specificity of FNA, especially that performed without image guidance. In a review of 121 lateral neck cysts, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma was identified in 24 percent of patients over 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, of patients who underwent preoperative FNA, over 30 percent with negative FNA results were subsequently found to have malignant pathology after cyst excision. For this reason, the treating clinician must maintain a high degree of suspicion in older adult patients with isolated neck cysts despite a negative FNA. Analysis of cyst fluid for HPV DNA and the use of cell block analysis may improve diagnostic accuracy in cases of occult HPV-associated OPSCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H37621073\" class=\"local\">'Excisional or incisional biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37621065\"><span class=\"h2\">Core biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the information provided by an FNA does not establish the diagnosis, core needle biopsy can be considered. Core biopsies in the head and neck are generally performed under local anesthesia, with a 14- to 20-gauge cutting needle. One to five passes are typically performed with an automatic needle gun for precise tissue acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>Advantages of core biopsy include greater tissue yield, leading to lower rates of nondiagnostic samples, decreased variability in pathological interpretation, and improved diagnostic accuracy in specific disease processes that require analysis of tissue architecture or flow cytometry, such as lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In a review of 237 patients who underwent core needle biopsy in the workup of lymphoma, 97 percent were fully diagnostic, allowing treatment initiation without excisional node biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>The disadvantages of core biopsy are primarily related to the potential trauma from larger-bore needles. Although increasing needle size may theoretically increase the risk of nerve injury or tumor seeding, in practice these events are exceedingly rare and do not appear more frequently for core biopsy than FNA. In a systematic review of the literature, including 610 articles, the estimated rates of tumor seeding after either FNA or core biopsy were below 0.002 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2689403443\"><span class=\"h2\">Image-guided biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound-guided or CT-guided FNA or core biopsies are considered in the setting of nonpalpable masses seen only with imaging. Advantages of image guidance include precise sampling adjacent to critical neurovascular structures as well as the ability to target higher-yield areas within a complex cystic-solid lesion. A randomized trial involving 81 patients with a head and neck mass less than 3 cm demonstrated improved tissue adequacy for FNA using ultrasound guidance as compared with palpation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Most neck masses within 3 cm of the skin surface are amenable to ultrasound guidance.

However, surgical excisional or incisional biopsy of a neck lesion that is subsequently found to be malignant creates several challenges for both the patient and treating physicians. If definitive surgery is later performed, completion lymph node dissection is substantially more difficult in the setting of prior surgery. In addition, open biopsy risks tumor spillage and requires resection of prior incisions and surrounding scar, or may require higher radiotherapy dosing to the prior surgical bed when definitive nonsurgical treatment is delivered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open biopsy can be more acceptable in the setting of an FNA or core biopsy being positive for lymphoma, but additional tissue is necessary for subtyping. </p><p/><p>If open resection of a cystic neck mass with benign or nondiagnostic FNA results is considered, referral must be made to a provider capable of performing completion node dissection in the same setting should the diagnosis return intraoperatively as a malignant head and neck cancer. This is particularly relevant in the HPV-associated OPSCC era where young nonsmokers with few comorbidities may present with cystic neck lesions initially mistaken for congenital cysts. As discussed above, needle biopsy of these masses is often nondiagnostic or falsely negative given their cystic nature, and a high level of suspicion must be maintained in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-neck-mass-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Additional findings on the history and physical examination may also suggest a malignant etiology. Patients suspected to have a malignant neck mass should be referred to a specialist and undergo contrast computed tomography of the neck and biopsy of the mass.

Core biopsy may increase diagnostic yield, and current evidence suggests that the risks of core biopsy are similar to those of FNA. Image guidance can aid in the needle biopsy of nonpalpable lesions. If needle biopsies continue to reveal nondiagnostic samples, open biopsy may be considered, but referral must be made to a surgeon trained in the management of malignant head and neck tumors who is capable of performing completion lymph node dissection in the same setting should this become necessary. (See <a href=\"#H37621057\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians need to be aware of the rising incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). OPSCC often presents as an asymptomatic cystic neck mass in young patients without traditional risk factors (eg, smoking or drinking) and can easily be mistaken for a congenital cyst.
