This cumulative ultrasonography evidence, in context, can significantly augment diagnosis and clinical, surgical, radiation, ablation, and other management. High among the merits of ultrasonography is enhanced sampling of thyroid cells and tissues for cytological, biochemical, molecular, and genetic investigation in conjunction with fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Ultrasonography also offers insights into aspects of physiology and epidemiology.</p><p>Current methods of ultrasonography permit &quot;real-time&quot; identification of structures as small as 2 mm in diameter, thereby allowing the visualization of very small tumors of the thyroid and parathyroid glands. These methods also permit estimates of overall and regional blood flow to the thyroid. However, the results of thyroid ultrasonography do not correlate perfectly with histopathologic findings.</p><p>Although the cost effectiveness of ultrasonography in solving patient-specific clinical problems has not been formally tested, ultrasonography, used judiciously, helps to answer important clinical questions in specific patients.

Thyroid ultrasound, in conjunction with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, plays an important role in the evaluation of a patient with a suspected thyroid nodule. It should be performed in all patients with a suspected thyroid nodule or nodular goiter on physical examination or with nodules incidentally noted on other imaging studies (carotid ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-positron emission tomography [PET] scan). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Nodule identification and characterization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solid nodules should be described by using normal thyroid tissue as a reference. They are called isoechoic if their texture closely resembles that of normal thyroid tissue, hyperechoic if more echogenic, and hypoechoic if less echogenic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81788\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81788 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71418\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71418 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51480\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51480 \">image 3</a>). </p><p>Preliminary studies suggest the potential use of an imaging risk stratification system proposed by the American College of Radiology (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System [TIRADS]) for the ultrasonic appearance of thyroid lesions (TIRADS 1 normal thyroid, TIRADS 2 benign lesions, TIRADS 3 probably benign lesions, TIRADS 4 suspicious lesions, TIRADS 5 probably malignant lesions, TIRADS 6 biopsy proven lesions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The ultrasonography classification has been correlated with an FNA classification (Bethesda) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atlas of thyroid cytopathology&quot;</a>). It is important for the clinician to understand that ultrasonography classification applies directly to the population investigated and only indirectly and imperfectly to a specific patient. </p><p>Hemorrhage within nodules alters the sonographic appearance. Clot may be hyperechoic and after liquefaction may be hypoechoic. As a result, in a hemorrhagic nodule, part looks cystic and part solid; this is called a complex nodule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55508\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55508 \">image 4</a>).</p><p>The presence of fluid in a nodule causes a relative increase in the transmission of the sound waves, resulting in increased echogenicity distal to the liquid. It may be difficult to distinguish between a hypoechoic solid nodule and a cystic nodule that contains debris.</p><p>A cyst is ultrasonically characterized as thin walled and spherical, without internal structure. It transmits ultrasound with little reflection and results in an increased echo pattern behind the structure. It is prudent to be conservative in the use of the word &quot;cyst.&quot; Pure cysts are rare and benign, but cystic degeneration of solid, benign, or malignant nodules is common.</p><p>Calcifications are brightly reflective echogenic densities that greatly attenuate the ultrasound beam. This blockade of the signal causes the phenomenon of &quot;shadowing,&quot; which renders the tissue deep to the calcification invisible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81952\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81952 \">image 5</a>). By altering the acoustic pathway, the ultrasonographer can avoid this pitfall. Air and metallic artifacts also cause shadowing and can mimic calcifications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria for identifying cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no ultrasonographic findings that are pathognomonic for thyroid cancer. Ultrasonic evidence of vascular invasion may be the most reliable predictor of malignancy but is observed uncommonly. The characteristics of nodules that have been evaluated for identifying cancers include the intensity of the echoes; the sharpness of the boundary of the nodule; the presence of a sonolucent &quot;halo&quot;; calcifications; internal structure, including vascularity; the shape (deeper or taller than wide in the transverse view); and size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68199 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The predictive value of these characteristics varies widely. In a retrospective evaluation of 849 nodules that were diagnosed at surgery or biopsy in 831 patients, the presence of at least one malignant feature had a sensitivity and specificity of 83 and 74 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The presence of multiple suspicious ultrasound features increases the likelihood for malignancy. In another series of 1244 nodules in 900 patients, nodules were stratified according to ultrasound characteristics that assessed cancer risk on a scale of 1 to 5, with nodules classified as 3.5 or greater evaluated as malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Of 233 nodules that were ultrasonographically evaluated as malignant, 76.8 percent were also malignant by cytology (FNA). Of the 142 nodules that were categorized as malignant on ultrasound and were surgically resected, 138 were confirmed by pathology to be thyroid cancer (97 percent positive predictive value for diagnosed cancer). Of 710 nodules evaluated as benign (ultrasound score &le;2.5), 96.1 percent had benign cytology. Thus, although ultrasound cannot be used to definitively diagnose thyroid cancer or select patients for thyroid surgery, ultrasound findings can be used to select nodules for FNA biopsy, for example, in a patient with multiple nodules. Indications for FNA are reviewed elsewhere. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Intensity of the echoes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant thyroid nodules often have a hypoechoic appearance on ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51480\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51480 \">image 3</a>). In a study of 202 patients with nodules, 62 percent of the cancers were hypoechoic, and few were hyperechoic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In another series of 132 consecutive ultrasound-guided FNA biopsies, none of the 14 cancers were hyperechoic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, many benign nodules are also less echogenic than surrounding normal thyroid tissue. The sensitivity and specificity of a hypoechoic appearance is approximately 53 and 73 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Sharpness of border</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sharpness of the border of a nodule probably has little diagnostic value, although cancers that have invaded surrounding tissue may have a poorly defined, irregular border. Furthermore, an ill-defined edge of a nodule may be a marker of aggressive characteristics of papillary thyroid cancer. In one series of 155 cases, poor definition of a nodule's edge was observed in 21.5 percent of patients, all of whom showed worse disease-free survival than those with a well-defined edge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Extrathyroidal invasion of a papillary cancer can be predicted preoperatively (with 75 percent accuracy) when 50 percent or more of the tumor abuts the thyroid capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Halo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some nodules are partly or completely surrounded by a sonolucent ring or halo. A halo only indicates that there is an interface between the thyroid tissue and the nodule that is less echogenic than either the nodule or the gland. The partition could be capsule or compressed or atrophic thyroid tissue, local inflammation, or edema. When seen with color flow Doppler imaging, the halo is often vascular and may represent capsular vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54263\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54263 \">image 6</a>). An incomplete or absent halo has been reported as a feature of malignancy but has neither high sensitivity nor specificity (64 and 61 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcifications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcifications are often present in both benign and malignant nodules and are therefore only partially predictive of histopathology. In one report, the prevalence of cancer was significantly higher when there were calcium flecks in a nodule (29 percent) than in nodules without calcium (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Furthermore, some information about a nodule (or lymph node) can be inferred from the nature of the calcification:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Punctate calcifications in the range of 1 mm are uncommonly seen and suggest the presence of microscopic psammoma bodies in papillary carcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60315\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60315 \">picture 1</a>). &quot;Twinkling&quot; on B-flow imaging may be a very sensitive way to detect microcalcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Using 10 to 13 MHz transducers, apparent microcalcifications may be detected within nodules. These bright spots have been reported to correlate with thyroid cancer in one-third of the cases. At histologic examination, only some of the bright spots prove to be calcified psammoma bodies. The rest may represent inspissated colloid, as mentioned below. Rarely, microcalcifications in the absence of a mass have been associated with papillary thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral or eggshell-like calcification is indicative of chronicity, suggesting a benign nodule. However, some cancers, probably those that are chronic and have undergone degenerative change, may demonstrate peripheral calcification, and therefore, diagnostic aspiration biopsy may be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coarse, scattered calcifications may be seen in benign or malignant nodules into which there was a hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55508\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55508 \">image 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large areas of calcification may be seen in medullary cancers of the thyroid.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Internal structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uniformity of the internal structure of a nodule is not a useful indicator for diagnosis of cancer; cancers may be either ultrasonographically solid or complex. The complex patterns in both benign nodules and cancers may result from cystic or hemorrhagic degeneration. Similarly, cystic degeneration may be seen in cancerous or benign regional lymph nodes.</p><p>There are some ultrasound findings that are useful predictors of benign nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The most common is a layered appearance of the echo pattern described as spongiform or honeycomb, which has been defined as an aggregation of microcystic spaces involving at least 50 percent of the nodule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61030\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61030 \">image 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This finding has been observed with colloid nodules that are almost invariably benign. A bright spot with a fading plume tail, like a comet, has also been described with small deposits of colloid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68699\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68699 \">image 8</a>) and must be differentiated from &quot;psammoma body&quot; microcalcifications described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Shape of a nodule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been reported that cancers more frequently than benign nodules have a tall and narrow shape that may provide a diagnostic clue. In one study, an anteroposterior and transverse diameter ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(A/T)</span> greater than 1 was more likely than central blood flow, microcalcifications, or irregular borders to identify cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">A/T</span> in combination with any other suspicious ultrasonographic characteristic missed fewer cancers than hypoechogenicity combined with any other suspicious characteristic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Color Doppler flow patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An internal flow pattern in a hypofunctioning (&quot;cold&quot;) nodule or lymph node should raise one's suspicion of malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82381\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82381 \">image 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53482\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53482 \">image 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, at its present stage of development, color Doppler flow cannot reliably distinguish benign from malignant pathology. </p><p>In one study of consecutive patients with nonpalpable thyroid nodules (8 to 15 mm), 31 of 402 thyroid nodules were thyroid malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. At ultrasound, an intranodular vascular pattern was present in 74 percent of malignant nodules. In another study of 203 patients with thyroid nodules who were treated surgically, the addition of color flow Doppler imaging to conventional sonography slightly increased the screening sensitivity and accuracy (from 72 to 83 percent) in identifying the 36 malignant thyroid nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, in another study, most thyroid cancers detected by ultrasonography lacked intranodular vascularity, and most hypervascular nodules were adenomas or &quot;adenomatoid&quot; structures that were not tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Hypervascularity may be more frequent in medullary thyroid cancer then in papillary thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3962822209\"><span class=\"h3\">Nodule size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large nodule diameter or size and volume may be able to predict the likelihood of thyroid cancer and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpalpable nodules (&quot;incidentalomas&quot;)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incidentalomas are nonpalpable thyroid nodules that are detected during other imaging procedures. Nonpalpable nodules have approximately the same risk of malignancy as palpable nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61668\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61668 \">image 11</a>). Thus, all incidentalomas cannot be dismissed as harmless. Ultrasound should be performed in all patients with nodules incidentally noted on other imaging studies (carotid ultrasound, CT, MRI, or FDG-PET scan). This topic is reviewed in more detail elsewhere.

Ultrasonography can detect and quantify the size of the cystic area that appears on a scintiscan as a &quot;cold&quot; area within the &quot;hot&quot; nodule, assuaging clinical concern that the &quot;cold&quot; zone might be a cancer. Alternatively, when the &quot;cold&quot; area is solid tissue, sonography can facilitate percutaneous biopsy to obtain a cytological diagnosis. &quot;Hot&quot; nodules can sometimes be differentiated from &quot;cold&quot; nodules with Doppler scanning because of their more prominent vascular patterns and significantly higher peak systolic velocity values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4206486\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring thyroid nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound is useful to monitor cytologically benign thyroid nodules and nodules that initially do not meet indications for FNA biopsy. Small changes in nodule size on serial ultrasonography do not require a repeat aspiration. However, reassessment is warranted when there is substantial growth. The criteria for repeat aspiration are reviewed elsewhere.

The accuracy of thyroid volume assessment of thyroid volume and improved intraobserver variability and repeatability appears to be improved with three-dimensional echography.

Radiation exposure includes therapeutic external radiation for the treatment of cancer, historical use of external radiation to treat a wide variety of nonmalignant conditions, and exposure to nuclear fallout (from testing, accidents, or in Japanese survivors of atomic bombing). The use of screening thyroid ultrasound to detect nodules in radiation-exposed patients is controversial and should be guided by individual risk factors, including dose of radiation to the thyroid, young age of exposure, and the presence of another potentially radiation-related tumor.

Identification of suspicious lymph nodes in a patient with a thyroid nodule increases the likelihood of malignancy. In some cases, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is obtained from the abnormal cervical lymph node rather than the nodule. For patients requiring thyroidectomy for biopsy-proven papillary thyroid cancer, preoperative neck ultrasound is used to identify suspicious lymph nodes prior to thyroidectomy as metastatic disease is often not clinically apparent to the surgeon intraoperatively. Preoperative cervical ultrasound can detect clinically nonpalpable, metastatic nodes in up to 30 percent of patients with papillary thyroid cancer, which can result in an altered surgical approach in as many as 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Ultrasonography is also essential to detect recurrence after thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. Cervical lymph nodes are the most common site of recurrent papillary thyroid cancer. (See <a href=\"#H22439917\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid cancer follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>Optimal recognition and diagnosis of adenopathy requires a high-resolution ultrasound system equipped with a high-energy linear probe, a 12 to 14 MHz transducer, B-Mode and Doppler capability, and a dedicated, specifically skilled operator. Benign lymph nodes tend to be thin and oval in shape and have an echogenic hilum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73138\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73138 \">image 12</a>), whereas malignant ones may have microcalcifications or cystic regions, are &quot;plump&quot; or rounded, lack a defined hilum, and may be intensely vascular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53482\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53482 \">image 10</a>). Color and spectral Doppler demonstrate peripheral rather than central vascularity but do not reliably distinguish benign and malignant nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>There are sonographic features of adenopathy that have a reasonably high specificity for malignancy but lesser sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of 56 lymph nodes (28 benign and 28 malignant) from patients who had a thyroidectomy for cancer and treatment with iodine-131 (I-131) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Of eight sonographic characteristics that were examined for sensitivity and specificity, cystic appearance (100 percent specific but only 11 percent sensitive), bright hyperechoic spots (100 percent specific, 46 percent sensitive), loss of a fatty hilum, and peripheral vascularization were determined to be major ultrasound criteria of lymph node malignancy, while round shape, hypoechogenicity, or the loss of hyperechoic hilum were minor criteria. In contrast, a nodal short axis less than 5 mm is highly likely to signify a benign lymph node. It is best for the clinician to be guided by several characteristics of a lymph node rather than the single feature.</p><p>In older, diabetic, or obese patients, fatty involution of lymph nodes (called lipoplastic lymphadenopathy) may enlarge nodes and mimic a palpable thyroid metastasis, which may confuse ultrasonic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In children and adolescents, inflammatory lymph nodes are common, whereas malignant lymph nodes are uncommon, so nodes must be conservatively interpreted in this age group even when a thyroid nodule is present.</p><p>Ultrasound-guided aspiration biopsy of enlarged cervical lymph nodes for cytological and immunocytological analysis can differentiate metastases from thyroid cancer and inflammatory lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It is often diagnostically helpful to rinse the needle that was used to aspirate a suspicious lymph node with a small volume of saline and to assay the washings for thyroglobulin. The presence of high levels of thyroglobulin in needle washings of aspirates of lymph nodes is presumptive evidence of metastatic thyroid cancer despite negative cytology. In contrast, it is not useful to rinse a needle that was employed to aspirate a thyroid nodule, because thyroid tissues should contain thyroglobulin whether or not there is cancer.

There is broad agreement that there are no significant differences in size between benign and malignant nodes in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/2,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,40</a>]. However, it has been reported that large size and central location of abnormal cervical lymph nodes assessed by ultrasound should be viewed with great suspicion. In a study of 42 patients who had biopsy-proven, recurrent differentiated thyroid cancer involving lymph nodes, a detailed sonographic neck examination was done on the day of surgery to remove the nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. One hundred and twenty-seven lesions were identified, plotted on a standard diagram of the neck, and given unique numbers to help track them during surgical intervention and histopathologic examinations. In univariate analysis, size, absent echogenic hilum, cystic changes, calcifications, and central location (medial to the sternomastoid muscle) of cervical lymph nodes were significantly associated with the presence of metastatic involvement. However, in multivariate analysis, only central location (odds ratio [OR] 4.07, 95% CI 1.64-10.10) and size (OR 5.14, 95% CI 1.64-16.06) remained significant. The receiver operating characteristic curve for the size of lymph nodes showed a large area under the curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.68-0.85), and a size of 7.5 mm showed the highest sensitivity and specificity. Other sonographic criteria that suggest malignancy are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Lymphadenopathy'</a> above.)</p><p>Ultrasound examination enhances the sensitivity for recurrent thyroid cancer that is achieved by the tumor marker thyroglobulin. Among 340 consecutive patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who had been treated with near-total thyroidectomy, 131-I thyroid ablation, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppressive doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>, recombinant human TSH (rhTSH)-stimulated thyroglobulin alone had a diagnostic sensitivity of 85 percent for detecting active disease and a negative predictive value of 98.2 percent. After adding the results of neck ultrasound, the sensitivity increased to 96.3 percent, and the negative predictive value to 99.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, ultrasonography of the neck may identify lymph node metastases from differentiated thyroid cancer even in patients with low or undetectable serum thyroglobulin levels and negative (131)I-whole body scintiscan performed after rhTSH stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Furthermore, in a five-year observational study of 80 consecutive cases of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, ultrasonography was highly sensitive in detecting nodal metastases in patients who had a near-total thyroidectomy and no I-131 therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Sonography during the initial several months after surgery for thyroid cancer may give misleading results. During this time there may be abundant noncancerous, enlarged lymph nodes and edematous or inflammatory postoperative changes that appear as heterogeneous and frequently sonodense focal structures. These findings should not be confused with tumor and can be avoided by delaying the examination for three or more months.</p><p>There are other sources of sonographic false positive evidence of recurrence. For example, suture granuloma that also mimicked cancer on 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (PET), but diagnosis of a suture granuloma was confirmed by an ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The appearance of suture granuloma versus papillary cancer on ultrasound demonstrates central or paracentral clustering of the internal echogenic foci and a paired appearance of echogenic foci that usually exceeds a diameter of 1 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1675562\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine screening for thyroid cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine screening of a population of individuals at low risk for thyroid cancer does not appear to be cost effective.

In a prospective study of ultrasound examination in 2637 atomic bomb survivors during an average follow-up of 13.3 years, six thyroid cancer cases were found among 68 subjects who had a solid thyroid nodule (7.3 percent), one case among 121 subjects who had a thyroid cyst (0.8 percent), and seven cases among 2434 thyroid nodule-free controls (0.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Nodular lymphoma reportedly has a very uniform and hypoechoic pattern that may be sufficiently hypoechoic to be pseudo-cystic.

Although excision of nonpalpable nodules that are in proximity to a vital structure could be palliative if the cancer is removed before it invades, one wonders if resection of nonpalpable or even larger deposits of differentiated thyroid cancer will benefit outcome since even bilateral radical neck dissection is not associated with enhanced results when compared with thyroidectomy alone.

Thus, it can reduce obstetric complications and contribute to neonatal health. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study, transuterine sonography was performed in 200 fetuses between 16 and 37 weeks of pregnancy to acquire gestational age-dependent and age-independent normative data on fetal thyroid size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>In mothers with Graves' disease, ultrasonography of the fetal thyroid gland by an experienced ultrasonographer is an excellent diagnostic tool that can facilitate assessment of fetal thyroid function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Used in conjunction with clinical features, such as fetal tachycardia, intrauterine growth retardation, and occasionally cord blood sampling, findings of fetal goiter may lead to the diagnosis of fetal thyrotoxicosis. Conversely, fetal goiter without clinical manifestations of fetal thyrotoxicosis may suggest overtreatment of the mother with antithyroid drugs and result in a dose reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>Ultrasonography can also be used to identify and facilitate treatment of fetal goitrous hypothyroidism. In one case report, a diagnosis of fetal goitrous hypothyroidism associated with high-output cardiac failure was made at 32 weeks of gestation using maternal ultrasound examination, amniocentesis, and cordocentesis. The fetus was treated by injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> sodium into the amniotic fluid at 33 weeks of gestation and the goiter decreased in size, the cardiac failure improved and fetal TSH was reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

Fetal blood sampling showed a high TSH indicative of fetal hypothyroidism. Treatment was given between 31 and 36 weeks with intraamniotic injections of triiodothyronine and subsequently with thyroxine. Thereafter, the fetal goiter became smaller, neck flexion increased, and polyhydramnios resolved. Following birth, neonatal serum TSH was within the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22440153\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonates and infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography has been applied to assess the thyroid in neonates and infants. Normative data were collected in a study of 100 (49 male) healthy term Scottish neonates to ascertain the length, breadth, and depth of each thyroid lobe and calculated the volume of each lobe using the formula for a prolate ellipsoid. There was no difference in mean volume between the right and left lobes, but there was considerable variation between the two lobes in individual infants. A wider geographic sample with attention to ambient iodine intake will be required before these data can be applied globally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>Another useful method for assessing the size of the thyroid in infants and small children is to determine the ratio of the maximum width of both thyroid lobes to the width of the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that sonography might be used as the first imaging tool in neonates and infants with congenital hypothyroidism, but that scintigraphy should be used to distinguish agenesis from ectopia.

The characteristics of nodules that have been evaluated for identifying cancers include the intensity of the echoes, the sharpness of the boundary of the nodule, the presence of a sonolucent &quot;halo,&quot; calcifications, internal structure, including vascularity, and the shape (taller than wide) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68199 \">table 1</a>). The cancer-predictive value of these characteristics varies widely and are cumulative; those with the highest clinical utility include microcalcifications, increased internal vascularity, taller than wide shape, indistinct margins (especially when they are focal), and hypoechogenicity. Although ultrasound cannot be used to definitively diagnose thyroid cancer or select patients for thyroid surgery, ultrasound findings offer important clues and can be used to select nodules for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy.
