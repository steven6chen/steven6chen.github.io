Numerous inciting agents have been described including, but not limited to, agricultural dusts, bioaerosols, microorganisms (fungal, bacterial, or protozoal), and certain reactive chemical species.

Correct diagnosis is based upon exposure history, clinical assessment, radiographic and physiologic findings, and, if possible, the result of removal of the patient from the suspected etiologic exposure. Other tests, such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung biopsy, are helpful in ruling out other potential diagnoses and in lending further support to the diagnosis of HP. Of note, cigarette smokers have a lower risk of developing HP than nonsmokers because of diminished antibody production following exposure to inhaled antigens.

The index cases usually have more severe disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Criteria 2, 3, and 5 are met &ndash; In these cases, the diagnosis is first suspected after BAL or transbronchial lung biopsy. It is critical that every attempt be made to identify the specific antigen. This often requires aggressive surveillance of the home and work environment by an experienced industrial hygienist. Complete removal of the patient from his or her usual environment for two to three weeks may lead to spontaneous improvement, and reexposure may result in acute symptoms that help identify environmental precipitants.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Probable or subclinical HP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient is considered to have probable HP if criteria 1, 2A, and 3 are present, and subclinical HP if criteria 1 and 3A are present. Sensitization, rather than HP, is present in patients who only fulfill criterion 1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical diagnosis of HP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of specific clinical parameters in establishing the diagnosis of HP was assessed using a cohort of 400 patients, 116 of whom were ultimately diagnosed with HP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This prediction rule was subsequently validated using a second cohort of 261 patients, 83 of whom were eventually diagnosed with HP. The authors used logistic regression analysis to identify six significant variables associated with HP. These included exposure to a known offending antigen, recurrent episodes of symptoms, symptoms occurring within 4 to 8 hours after exposure, weight loss, crackles on chest exam, and the presence of serum precipitins. The probability of HP was then summarized based on the presence or absence of these predictors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61899\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61899 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Two multidimensional diagnostic models were shown to support the identification of patients with chronic HP with a high degree of specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Model 1 included the following predictor variables: age, a history of down feather <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bird exposure, the presence of diffuse craniocaudal ground-glass opacity on HRCT, and the presence of mosaic perfusion on HRCT. An &quot;HP score&quot; point value &ge;63 (range 0 to 100) showed a specificity of 91 percent and sensitivity of 48 percent for the diagnosis of chronic HP. Model 2 included: age, history of down feather <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bird exposure, and a moderate to high confidence in the radiographic diagnosis of HP. Using model 2, HP scores &ge;57 demonstrated a specificity of 91 percent and sensitivity of 50 percent for the diagnosis of chronic HP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SERUM PRECIPITINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum can be assayed for precipitating IgG antibodies against many potential antigens, such as molds, fungi, grain dust, or blood or other secretions from animal sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Unfortunately, the presence of precipitins does not make a definite diagnosis. As an example, 30 to 40 percent of farmers have positive serum precipitins to common causes of HP in the absence of clinical disease. The incidence of serum precipitins in asymptomatic bird breeders is even higher, probably due to more intense and prolonged exposure to inciting antigens.</p><p>Another problem is that the absence of serum precipitins does not rule out HP. We have found the routine precipitin panel in most laboratories to be virtually <strong>useless</strong> because of the high rate of falsely negative results. Although this is primarily because commercial assays test for only a small fraction of the potential causative antigens, the test may be non-reactive in some cases even if the correct antigen is included.</p><p>If one's reference laboratory has the capability, it is more helpful to obtain a sample of likely causative antigens from the original source and test it against the patient's blood. A positive reaction is based upon the presence of a precipitin band against the antigen. In many cases, the main value of a positive result is to convince a patient that he or she is indeed sensitive to something in the environment, particularly when it implies that a valued and loved pet may require removal.</p><p>There is often misunderstanding that skin test reactivity has the same implication as the finding of serum precipitins. However, skin tests are not helpful in the diagnosis of HP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INHALATION CHALLENGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhalation challenge by reexposure of the patient to the environment of the supposed agent is commonly recommended. It can demonstrate a relationship between symptoms and a particular environment and thus support the diagnosis of HP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52421\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52421 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. Two patterns of response are observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most commonly, fever, malaise, headache, crackles on chest exam, peripheral neutrophilia, and decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) occur 8 to 12 hours after exposure. Hypoxemia and radiologic abnormalities (increase in ground glass opacities or nodularity) may occur in severe reactions. Consequently, the patient should be monitored closely or have ready access to medical care for at least 24 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52421\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52421 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less commonly, a two stage reaction can occur in atopic individuals, with immediate, transient wheezing and a decrease in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) but preservation of the diffusing capacity. This is followed in four to six hours by decreased FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC, fever, and leukocytosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75805\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75805 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p>Another method, inhalation challenge to a preparation of a suspected antigen in a hospital setting, is <strong>not</strong> generally performed because it may induce progressive disease, and because there are no standardized antigen preparations available. While we do not recommend such challenges at present, some studies suggest such testing may have utility in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/26,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28-30</a>].</p><p>These challenges have often been performed in asymptomatic but exposed persons following the discovery of an outbreak. A positive test in the absence of symptoms is thought to reflect the &quot;healthy worker&quot; effect: certain workers under even heavy exposure will, for unclear reasons, report less frequent symptoms as compared to those who are less heavily exposed to a particular respiratory irritant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH RESOLUTION CT SCAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is increasingly used in the diagnosis of HP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/17,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,32</a>]. Although the HRCT pattern is variable depending on the stage of disease, the characteristic appearance is a mid-to-upper zone predominance of centrilobular ground-glass or nodular opacities with signs of air-trapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. In the proper clinical setting (eg, fulfilling criteria 2 and 3 above) and with the presence of a &quot;classic&quot; HRCT scan, a presumptive diagnosis of HP can be established even without the identification of the source of exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute HP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of acute HP, HRCT is often used to confirm the presence of pneumonitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59749\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59749 \">image 1</a>). The typical finding is ground-glass opacification; however, the HRCT may be normal due to the fleeting nature of the radiographic opacities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Subacute HP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with subacute HP, typical HRCT findings include diffuse micronodules, ground-glass attenuation, focal air trapping or emphysema, and mild fibrotic changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71870\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71870 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic HP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In chronic HP, the HRCT tends to show ground-glass attenuation and parenchymal micronodules, accompanied by honeycombing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> emphysema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52041\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52041 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The major difficulty is differentiating chronic HP from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) on HRCT. Certain features have been suggested as favoring HP over IPF or NSIP: lobular areas with decreased attenuation and vascularity, centrilobular nodules, and lack of lower zone predominance of abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59749\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59749 \">image 1</a>). However, HRCT features allowed confident distinction of chronic HP from IPF and NSIP only about 50 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>HRCT findings may serve as a useful prognostic indicator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective series of 69 patients with HP, the presence and extent of fibrosis by HRCT scan were associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, a smaller retrospective series of 26 patients did not find this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In patients with chronic HP, the extent of fibrosis (ie, reticulations and honeycombing) predicts a worse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be helpful in supporting the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Unfortunately, many cases go unrecognized both in the workplace and in the home. There are several reasons why misdiagnosis and delays in diagnosis occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful review of the patient's potential occupational, avocational, or domestic exposures is not performed, or a relationship between the exposure and the illness is dismissed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician fails to ask the right questions or to recognize features that suggest an etiologic environmental or occupational exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55505 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician dismisses HP because of the presence of a normal chest radiograph. A meta-analysis of published reports of outbreaks of HP showed a statistically significant decline in the sensitivity of chest radiographs for the diagnosis of HP over the years 1950 through 1980. Chest radiographs were also less likely to be abnormal when a population-based approach to the diagnosis of disease had been undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of negative serum precipitins is accepted as ruling out the possibility of HP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of obstructive ventilatory defects is assumed to mitigate against a diagnosis of HP (even in a nonsmoker) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of a &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;inadequate&quot; transbronchial lung biopsy is accepted to rule out HP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lymphocyte count &lt;40 percent is accepted to rule out HP. While many patients with HP, particularly those with acute or subacute HP, have a BAL lymphocytosis &gt;40 percent, the degree of lymphocytosis may be lower among cigarette smokers, patients with HP due to soluble avian antigens, and those with a greater duration of time since last exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incorrect pathological interpretation of the lung biopsy is obtained, usually because subtle findings are assumed to be insignificant. This is particularly common in mild or early cases. In addition, in patients with advanced disease, extensive fibrosis with honeycomb changes may make it difficult to distinguish HP from usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MIMICS OF HP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several important clinical syndromes that occur as a result of inhalation of organic agents but are not true forms of HP. Nevertheless, they are important to recognize and manage. In particular, inhalation fever, organic dust toxic syndrome, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and chronic airflow limitation have been found in patients with exposure to agricultural products, wood dust, and to a lesser extent among persons with other exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Inhalation fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhalation fevers (eg, &quot;Monday morning miseries&quot;, &quot;metal fume fever&quot;, &quot;humidifier fever&quot;) are characterized by fevers, chills, malaise, headaches, and myalgias without prominent pulmonary findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Leukocytosis, diffuse opacities on chest radiograph, restrictive ventilatory defects, and reduced diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) are common laboratory abnormalities. Obliterative bronchiolitis without granulomas is usually present on lung biopsy; desquamative interstitial pneumonitis and diffuse alveolar damage may also be seen. These cases are thought not to represent true cases of HP because no prior sensitization is required and there is a lack of serologic response to common fungal antigens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic bronchitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic obstructive lung disease is the most common respiratory syndrome among agricultural workers and the most common cause of severe lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].

Correct diagnosis is based upon exposure history, clinical assessment, radiographic and physiologic findings, and, if possible, the response to avoidance of the suspected etiologic agent. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The key diagnostic criteria are: known exposure to offending antigen(s); compatible clinical, radiographic, or physiologic findings; bronchoalveolar lavage with lymphocytosis; positive inhalation challenge testing; and histopathology showing poorly formed, noncaseating granulomas <strong>OR</strong> a mononuclear cell infiltrate. Not all of these features are present in all patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most laboratory panels for measurement of serum precipitins have a high false negative rate. Testing of a patient's serum against likely causative antigens from the original environmental source may be more helpful. Skin tests are not helpful in the diagnosis of HP. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Serum precipitins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristic high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan appearance is a mid-to-upper zone predominance of centrilobular ground-glass or nodular opacities with signs of air-trapping. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'High resolution CT scan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be helpful in supporting the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. A marked BAL lymphocytosis (greater than 20 percent and often exceeding 50 percent) may be seen. The BAL <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4+/CD8+</span> ratio is usually decreased to less than 1.0 and the typical lymphocyte phenotype in BAL is <span class=\"nowrap\">CD3+/CD8+/CD56+/CD57+/CD10-</span>. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Bronchoalveolar lavage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The histopathologic findings on transbronchial biopsy in HP usually include: poorly formed granulomata located near respiratory or terminal bronchioles and a patchy mononuclear cell infiltration of the alveolar walls. The findings may be subtle and the pathologist should be alerted to look specifically for this diagnosis. In chronic HP, the lung pathology may more closely resemble usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Lung biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several diseases may mimic HP; in particular, inhalation &quot;metal fume&quot; fever, organic dust toxic syndrome, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and airway-centered interstitial fibrosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
