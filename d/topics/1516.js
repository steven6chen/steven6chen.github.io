In the developing fetus, oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein enters the right atrium via the inferior vena cava and is shunted into the left atrium, circumventing the noninflated lungs. After birth, a relative increase in left atrial pressure closes the flap, and adhesions frequently result in a structurally intact atrial septum. However, in approximately 25 percent of adults, the foramen ovale remains patent and acts as a potential interatrial shunt (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78654\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef78654 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56656\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56656 \">movie 2</a>).

Some patients with cryptogenic stroke have a patent foramen ovale (PFO), an atrial septal defect (ASD), or an atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) that can be identified by echocardiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography in detection of cardiac and aortic sources of systemic embolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These structures have been implicated in the pathogenesis of embolic events. However, identification of one or more of these atrial septal abnormalities in a patient with an ischemic event does not prove a causal relationship since other sources or conduits of embolism may also be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Paradoxical emboli</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A paradoxical embolus originates in the systemic venous circulation and enters the systemic arterial circulation through a PFO, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or extracardiac communication such as a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Paradoxical embolism is a speculative cause of an embolic neurologic event unless a thrombus is seen trapped in the septal defect. Case reports have described patients with an &quot;impending&quot; paradoxical embolus due to a trapped embolus in a PFO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

Air emboli can arise from intravenous lines. Fat emboli can complicate trauma or orthopedic procedures.</p><p>Transvenous cardiac device (pacemaker or defibrillator) leads, which are most commonly placed in right-sided heart chambers, are another potential nidus for the formation of mobile thrombi that can be a source of pulmonary emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] or, via paradoxical embolization, can result in cerebral or other systemic emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Small mobile thrombi are frequently observed by echocardiography attached to the right atrial segments of these leads. Although data are limited, a retrospective study of patients with transvenous cardiac device leads in the right atrium or right ventricle found that the presence of PFO was associated with a significantly increased risk of cardioembolic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Further data are needed to confirm this finding and determine how this compares with the risk of cardioembolic stroke in patients with PFO who do not have intracardiac device leads.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Right-to-left shunting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right-to-left shunting through a PFO or an ASD can result in a paradoxical embolus (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Paradoxical emboli'</a> above).</p><p>Since a transient right-to-left atrial pressure gradient is sufficient to induce right-to-left shunting across a PFO (or atrial septal defect [ASD]), such shunts commonly occur in individuals with no significant net right-to-left shunting between the atria (ie, those with no net intracardiac shunt or with a net left-to-right shunt). Chronic elevation in right heart pressures (eg, Eisenmenger syndrome) is not required for paradoxical embolism to occur. Transient right-to-left shunting across a PFO is a dynamic phenomenon given the significant variability of both right and left atrial pressures.</p><p>Transient increases in right atrial pressure occur in normal individuals during early ventricular systole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78654\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef78654 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56656\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56656 \">movie 2</a>), during the Valsalva maneuver, and with repetitive cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, a persistent, large Eustachian valve or a Chiari network may direct inferior vena caval blood toward the atrial septum where a PFO or ASD is located and potentially into the left atrium and systemic circulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;, section on 'Eustachian valve and Chiari network'</a>.)</p><p>With the Valsalva maneuver, transient right-to-left shunting in patients with a PFO or an ASD can be induced particularly during Valsalva release. During the straining phase, the right atrial pressure rises disproportionately, and during release there is a sudden increase in systemic venous return into the right atrium. Physiologic conditions associated with a Valsalva maneuver include straining to defecate, lifting or pushing heavy objects, and vigorous repetitive cough. In one series of 148 patients with a PFO, 84 (57 percent) had right-to-left shunting at rest, and 136 (92 percent) had right-to-left shunting with straining or coughing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

This disorder is defined as an orthostatic right-to-left shunt across an atrial septal defect or PFO resulting in decreases in oxygen saturation when changing position from prone to upright, leading to significant positional dyspnea.

Atrial septal aneurysms have been classified according to their oscillation (intrusion) into the left or right atrium and according to their motion during the respiratory cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Most investigators have defined an atrial septal aneurysm as an excursion of at least 10 or 15 mm. The aneurysm may either bulge persistently into the right or left atrium or exhibit striking oscillations from right atrium to left atrium during respiration, in response to fluctuating pressure gradients between the atria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Atrial septal aneurysm is most commonly an incidental finding. However, some patients with atrial septal aneurysm present with systemic thromboembolism and some present with symptoms and signs of significant intracardiac shunting via one or more associated atrial septal defects.

In the review of 195 cases cited above, 47 percent were missed with TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of atrial septal aneurysm varies with the method of identification and the population studied. Atrial septal aneurysms have been found in 1 percent of necropsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and 0.2 to 2 percent of patients undergoing TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. With TEE, atrial septal aneurysms were detected in 2.2 percent of population controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], 4 percent of patients referred for TEE for a reason other than detection of a source of embolic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and 4.9 percent of patients undergoing cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>There is an increased prevalence of atrial septal aneurysms among patients with cerebral ischemic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/16,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23,25</a>]. As an example, atrial septal aneurysm was observed in 7.9 to 15 percent of patients with a possible embolic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23</a>] and 28 percent of those with a cerebral ischemic event and normal carotid arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between atrial septal aneurysm and cryptogenic stroke. Since atrial septal aneurysm is commonly associated with PFO and atrial septal defect, paradoxical embolism may occur via the septal defect. In patients with atrial septal aneurysm without an intracardiac shunt, it has been hypothesized that fibrin-platelet particles adhere to the left atrial side of the aneurysm and are dislodged by oscillations of the aneurysm, causing systemic embolism.</p><p>An intracardiac shunt has been reported in up to 78 percent of patients with an atrial septal aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/16-19,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19,23,25</a>]. Most patients (54 to 84 percent) with cerebral ischemic events and an atrial septal aneurysm also have an interatrial shunt, usually via a PFO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/3,19,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19,23,25</a>]. In a multicenter review of 195 cases in which atrial septal aneurysm was detected by TEE, atrial septal aneurysm was the only defect in 32 percent and was associated with an interatrial shunt in 54 percent, most often a PFO (33 percent) or atrial septal defect (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Some atrial septal aneurysms are associated with multiple atrial septal fenestrations (perforations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Left-sided sources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common source of cerebral emboli originating in the systemic arterial circulation in patients with atrial septal abnormalities is the left atrium (particularly left atrial appendage), especially in those with atrial fibrillation. Patients with a hemodynamically significant atrial septal defect causing volume overload of the atria and right ventricle are at risk for atrial fibrillation. Although evidence is more limited, patients with PFO or atrial septal aneurysm may also be predisposed to atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27</a>].</p><p>Other potential sources of emboli are left-sided tumors, such as atrial myxoma and papillary fibroelastoma, left-sided prosthetic valve thrombosis, and vegetations caused by infective endocarditis or other disorders.

The causes of cryptogenic stroke are likely heterogeneous with embolism a dominant etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is an increased prevalence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) and atrial septal aneurysm in patients who have experienced a cryptogenic stroke, suggesting that paradoxical embolism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other mechanisms related to PFO and atrial septal aneurysm are the cause of some proportion of cryptogenic strokes. However, the detection of an atrial septal abnormality in a patient with an embolic stroke does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.

Differences in the PFO-attributable fraction of stroke probably explain the discrepant findings of the case-control and population-based studies.

A PFO or ASD should be considered as a potential cause of cryptogenic embolic stroke or TIA in patients &le;60 years of age with no other identifiable cause. The history should include specific questions that define the circumstances immediately preceding the event. Was the patient straining, coughing vigorously, or engaged in strenuous isometric effort such as lifting or pushing a heavy object? Was there any risk for deep venous thrombosis such as prolonged immobility (eg, postoperative status, sitting in a cramped airline seat with legs dependent and knees flexed) or hypercoagulability?</p><p>When evaluating a cryptogenic stroke, the assessment should determine whether the event is clinically suggestive of an embolic stroke. Embolism is especially likely when neuroimaging reveals infarcts in multiple vascular territories or a single wedge-shaped infarct involving cortex and the underlying subcortical white matter. With embolic stroke, the neurologic deficit is typically maximal from the onset, with a tendency to improve quickly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;, section on 'Determining a presumptive diagnosis of stroke subtype'</a>.)</p><p>Whether or not an embolic stroke is related to PFO or to another mechanism cannot be determined reliably based upon neuroimaging features alone. However, certain findings may be more suggestive of PFO. In an analysis of data from subjects with cryptogenic stroke and PFO (n = 1141) or no PFO (n = 1539) in the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) study database, characteristics associated with a significantly higher prevalence of PFO were a large index stroke (odds ratio [OR] 1.36), index stroke seen on imaging (OR 1.53), and superficial (ie, involving the cerebral or cerebellar cortex) stroke location (OR 1.54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A lower prevalence of PFO was significantly associated with prior stroke seen on the index imaging, but this association was no longer statistically significant after controlling for site and age alone, or after controlling for other clinical variables (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking status, history of stroke or TIA). The prevalence of PFO was slightly increased among patients with multiple index strokes on imaging, but the relationship was not statistically significant.</p><p>Other identifiable causes of stroke should be excluded by appropriate evaluation and testing. Older patients may be at risk for atherothrombotic cerebral embolism originating from extracranial and intracranial large arteries, the aortic arch, or the ascending aorta, and for lacunar infarction caused by small vessel disease. Vascular imaging, including magnetic resonance angiography, CT angiography, or Doppler and color duplex ultrasonography of the extracranial and intracranial arteries, is useful to evaluate for large vessel occlusive disease. The diagnosis of lacunar infarction relies upon finding a clinical stroke syndrome that is consistent with the location of a small noncortical infarct seen on CT or MRI.

Echocardiography (TTE or transesophageal echocardiogram [TEE]) with agitated saline contrast is used to detect transient right-to-left shunting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and assessment of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As discussed earlier (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Risk of embolic stroke'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prospective studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Conclusions'</a> above), the PFO-attributable fraction of stroke varies widely and decreases with age and the presence of vascular risk factors. For patients &le;60 years of age with an embolic-appearing stroke without an alternative explanation (ie, cryptogenic), particularly those who lack cardiovascular risk factors, we suggest TEE when TTE is nondiagnostic. The TEE should be performed with color Doppler study and agitated saline contrast injection at rest, with cough, and Valsalva maneuver. Although agitated saline contrast is not routinely injected via a femoral vein site in most centers, sensitivity for detection of a PFO is higher when contrast is injected from a femoral vein site as compared with an antecubital site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. When a satisfactory Valsalva maneuver cannot be accomplished in a sedated patient undergoing TEE, positive end-inspiratory pressure can produce the desired stimulus.</p><p>It is important to note that in older patients (ie, &gt;60 years of age), a TEE may still be warranted to detect a source of embolic stroke other than an atrial septal abnormality, such as aortic arch atheromatous disease or a left atrial appendage thrombus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views#H9886539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography: Indications, complications, and normal views&quot;, section on 'Indications for TEE'</a>). In addition, there may be occasional older patients with cryptogenic embolic stroke who lack cardiovascular risk factors. Thus, some experts would pursue a full evaluation for PFO, including TEE, regardless of age.</p><p>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound with agitated saline contrast is also a sensitive method of detecting right-to-left shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. However, unlike echocardiography, TCD cannot detect other cardiac sources of embolism, and it does not differentiate between intracardiac and extracardiac sources of shunting. Thus, TCD is complementary to echocardiography for PFO detection during a work-up for stroke etiology. In addition, TCD is a sensitive, minimally invasive method for follow-up if PFO closure is attempted.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Risk of embolic stroke'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increased prevalence of PFO and atrial septal aneurysm in patients who have experienced a cryptogenic stroke, suggesting that paradoxical embolism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other mechanisms related to PFO and atrial septal aneurysm are the cause of some proportion of cryptogenic strokes. However, accumulating data, including population based studies, suggest that the presence of an isolated PFO is <strong>not</strong> associated with an increased risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. In addition, there are conflicting data pertaining to the combination of PFO and atrial septal aneurysm and an increased risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Risk of embolic stroke'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The true risk of primary or recurrent ischemic stroke associated with PFO and atrial septal aneurysm continues to be difficult to estimate. However, available data can be summarized as follows (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Conclusions'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple case-control trials have reported an increased prevalence of PFO in patients who have had a cryptogenic stroke, suggesting that PFO is frequent cause of cryptogenic stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In contrast, population-based cohort studies, which enrolled predominantly older subjects, have found no statistically significant association between the risk of first ischemic stroke and presence of a PFO.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The PFO-attributable fraction of stroke varies widely and decreases with age and the presence of vascular risk factors. Differences in the PFO-attributable fraction of stroke probably explain the discrepant findings of the case-control and population-based studies. Subjects with cryptogenic stroke are generally younger and more likely to have a higher PFO-attributable fraction of stroke than the older subjects enrolled in the population-based studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with cryptogenic stroke, the risk of stroke recurrence is inversely related to the likelihood that the PFO was responsible for the index stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It remains uncertain whether an atrial septal aneurysm, alone or associated with a PFO, is a risk factor for initial or recurrent cryptogenic stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An atrial septal abnormality (PFO or atrial septal defect) should be considered in patients who are &le;60 years of age with a cryptogenic stroke. Other identifiable causes of stroke should be excluded by appropriate evaluation and testing. Vascular imaging, including magnetic resonance angiography, CT angiography, or Doppler and color duplex ultrasonography of the extracranial and intracranial arteries, is useful to evaluate for large vessel occlusive disease. All patients with suspected embolic stroke should have an echocardiogram. For patients &le;60 years of age with an embolic-appearing stroke without an alternative explanation (ie, cryptogenic), particularly those who lack cardiovascular risk factors, we suggest the use of TEE when transthoracic echocardiography is nondiagnostic. The TEE should be performed with color Doppler study and agitated saline contrast injection at rest, with cough, and Valsalva maneuver.
