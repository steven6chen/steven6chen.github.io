T cell development and the cellular immune response are reviewed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>).

This form of the TCR is also called TCR2.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minority of circulating T cells bear a different type of TCR made up of two chains, called gamma and delta (TCR1). However, T cells expressing TCR1 may predominate in some tissues (eg, intestinal mucosa).</p><p/><p>As with immunoglobulins, each TCR chain is encoded by multiple rearranging gene segments. The rearrangement process leads to diversification of the assembled genes through differences in the manner in which gene segments are joined in each cell undergoing its own unique rearrangement events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=structure-of-immunoglobulins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Structure of immunoglobulins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similar to immunoglobulin molecules, TCR proteins contain variable (V), diverse (D), joining (J), and constant (C) regions. The variable regions are divided into framework and hypervariable regions, as are antibody V regions. The hypervariable portions of both B and TCR variable regions are also called complementarity determining regions (CDRs). X-ray crystallography studies show that the amino acids encoded by the CDR1 and CDR2 in TCR alpha and beta variable region gene segments often interact with the complex of peptide plus major histocompatibility complex molecule (peptide-MHC). These portions of the TCR may be the focus of evolutionary selective pressure for MHC binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. TCRs also exhibit allotypic and idiotypic determinants associated with constant and variable regions, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">T CELL RECEPTOR GENE ORGANIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chromosomal locations of the TCR genes are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F76049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76049 \">table 1</a>). The alpha locus, analogous to immunoglobulin light chains, contains three gene clusters: V (variable) alpha, J (joining) alpha, and C (constant) alpha (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75615\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75615 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>The TCR beta chain is encoded by four gene segments (V, J, and C, as above, plus D [diversity]), similar to the immunoglobulin heavy chain. The figure shows the organization of the beta chain gene clusters, V beta, and a tandem of D beta 1-J beta 1-C beta 1 and D beta 2-J beta 2-C beta 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55731\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55731 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/4,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-9</a>]. TCR gamma genes, like TCR alpha genes, are composed of three rearranging segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78099 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>].</p><p>Like beta chains, delta chains are made up of four gene segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64384\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64384 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Note that the delta locus is positioned between V alpha and J alpha. Thus, a chromosome that has rearranged the alpha locus no longer contains DNA encoding the delta chain.</p><p>Sequence analysis of large numbers of V alpha and V delta genes from ethnically diverse individuals reveals significant allelic variation (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) in many of these genes. These sequences define haplotypes that can be used to infer divergence among ethnic groups and possibly also patterns of evolutionary selection that may have implications for immune protection and other disease associations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">T CELL RECEPTOR GENE REARRANGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The orderly progression of TCR gene segment rearrangement is regulated in a complex manner by chromatin structure determining accessibility to gene segments and signal sequences, as well as a variety of promoters, enhancers, and other associated DNA sequences that recruit a variety of transcription and binding factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>TCR genes rearrange via the same mechanisms and according to the same rules as immunoglobulin genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>). The 3' flanking region of V beta genes contain heptamer and nonamer recombination signal sequences separated by a 23 base-pair (bp) spacer. D beta genes are also flanked by nonamer and heptamer sequences with 12 bp spacers on either side, while J beta genes have flanking sequences with 23 bp spacers on the 5' side. These signal sequences also flank the alpha, gamma, and delta TCR gene segments.</p><p>There are constraints on the joining of gene segments that act in conjunction with the <span class=\"nowrap\">12/23</span> base-pair rule but that are not determined by the number of nucleotides in the spacers alone. Undefined sequence features within or near the <span class=\"nowrap\">signal/spacer</span> units also act to determine which segments may or may not join together. This level of regulation is called &quot;beyond <span class=\"nowrap\">12/23&quot;</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(B12/23)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The organization and rearrangement of immunoglobulin and TCR genes also have important differences:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TCR gene loci tend to have fewer V region segments and a greater number of J segments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Junctional diversity with the addition of N regions at gene segment junctions and with utilization of D genes in multiple reading frames plays a greater role in generating diversity in the TCR repertoire.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TCR genes do not undergo somatic hypermutation following initial rearrangement. Expressed TCR genes are very stable during T cell development.</p><p/><p>Several instances have been described where V gamma gene segments are productively rearranged with J beta and C beta segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These rearrangements produce functional, expressed genes with all of the molecular characteristics that one would expect from rearrangement and joining directed by the signal sequences and mechanisms discussed above. The rearrangements require an inversion involving a large part of chromosome 7 to bring these loci into a relationship permitting gene recombination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F76049\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76049 \">table 1</a>). Lymphocytes containing this type of rearrangement represent approximately 1 in 12,500 of peripheral blood lymphocytes in healthy individuals.</p><p>T cells expressing TCR1 do not express TCR2, and vice versa. However, beta genes may rearrange incompletely in TCR1-positive cells, while gamma genes may rearrange normally in TCR2-positive cells but without ensuing gamma transcription. As one may suspect, TCR gene expression is controlled by DNA sequences and sequence-specific regulatory proteins similar to those governing immunoglobulin gene expression. Regulation occurs via both positive (increase transcription) and negative (suppressive) mechanisms. The regulation of TCR gene expression is beyond the scope of this discussion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TCR gene rearrangement does not occur prior to cell entry into the thymus. The gamma and delta genes are the first to be expressed during fetal thymic T cell development. The beta genes are next expressed in the fetus. The alpha genes are expressed last. Subsequently, TCR1- and TCR2-bearing cells develop contemporaneously. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLELIC EXCLUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described elsewhere, B cells express a single immunoglobulin specificity. Its antibodies contain only one type of heavy or light chain. The regulation of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement during B cell development dictates that only one (of two) immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and only one light chain locus will ever contain a functional rearranged gene. The other will be either inexpressible due to unsuccessful rearrangement or will be incompletely rearranged. Thus, only one immunoglobulin heavy or light chain allele is expressed. This is referred to as allelic exclusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>T cells also exhibit allelic exclusion, but it is achieved differently from that in B cells. In T cells bearing TCR2 (alpha-beta), the beta genes rearrange first. Following a productive beta gene rearrangement, the beta protein is expressed on the cell surface in association with the pre-T alpha chain (pTalpha, the product of a single gene that is not made up of rearranging gene segments). A signal received through pTalpha-beta suppresses further beta gene rearrangement and is required for the initiation of alpha gene rearrangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>In contrast to immunoglobulin light chains, the productive rearrangement of one alpha locus and expression of a mature TCR alpha-beta heterodimer does not stop alpha gene rearrangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It is possible to have one cell with two productively rearranged alpha genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In some instances, since one alpha chain is incapable of forming a heterodimer with the expressed beta, only one heterodimer appears on the cell surface. In this way, there is phenotypic allelic exclusion even if there is not genotypic exclusion.</p><p>However, T cells expressing two different alpha chains in complete heterodimeric receptors have been described. The differences in allelic exclusion between T cells and B cells must reflect the different constraints placed on these cell types by the selective processes that maintain self-tolerance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">T CELL RECEPTOR EXCISION CIRCLES (TRECs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The germline DNA that is in between two segments that are being joined (eg, V beta and J beta) is excised and covalently closed to form a stable DNA loop during the process of gene segment rearrangement. This loop is known as a T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) and is maintained as a nonreplicating episomal DNA fragment in the T cell nucleus. TRECs are found only in T cells still within the thymus or those that have left recently (recent thymic emigrants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The TREC content is diluted as T cells expand in the periphery since TRECs are not replicated. TREC numbers, easily quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are used as a measure of thymic output or function in a variety of disease states, including primary and secondary immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-primary-immunodeficiencies#H114056780\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for primary immunodeficiencies&quot;, section on 'Overview of TREC screening test'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RECEPTOR EDITING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One series of gene rearrangements (of either immunoglobulin or TCR genes, either productive or nonproductive) may leave many upstream V genes and downstream D or J genes that may be used in a subsequent rearrangement event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This process is known as receptor editing.</p><p>Because of the large number of J alpha genes, the alpha locus may commonly undergo many nested rearrangements during T cell development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Murine studies suggest that even after exit from the thymus, some T cells may undergo receptor editing rearrangement at the beta locus (ie, replacement of the beta chain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. This may occur to change an autoreactive TCR specificity and maintain tolerance. Whether or not this contributes significantly to the T cell repertoire or maintenance of tolerance in mice or humans is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">REPERTOIRE DIVERSITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms of gene rearrangement described above ultimately yield a large repertoire of distinct TCR specificities. The predominant type of T cell in the human periphery, cells expressing TCR2 <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha/beta),</span> contains approximately 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> different molecular types of TCRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These include cells having low affinity for their targets as well as cells with high affinity. The affinity of the TCR for its peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) target determines the consequences of interaction: activation, anergy, memory cell formation, etc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-genetics/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The determinants of what constitutes an adequate repertoire for effective antimicrobial immunity have not yet been determined.
