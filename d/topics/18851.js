It is found worldwide, with a prevalence of approximately 1 case in 30,000 live births in most populations. Impaired biliary copper excretion leads to accumulation of copper in several organs, most notably the liver, brain, and cornea. Over time, the liver is progressively damaged and eventually becomes cirrhotic and fails. In addition, patients may develop neurologic complications, which can be severe and progressive. Establishing a diagnosis of Wilson disease is crucial since early detection and treatment may prevent disease progression and even reverse damage in some patients. </p><p>Wilson disease should be considered in any patient with unexplained liver, neurologic, or psychiatric abnormalities. In addition, first-degree relatives of patients with Wilson disease should be screened for Wilson disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H65234572\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'When to consider Wilson disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H65234586\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Screening family members'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the specific diagnostic tests used in the evaluation of patients with suspected Wilson disease. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, approach to diagnosis, and treatment of Wilson disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65234912\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with clinical features suggestive of Wilson disease (eg, abnormal liver tests combined with neurologic symptoms), we start by obtaining liver biochemical tests, a complete blood count, serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels, an ocular slit-lamp examination, and a 24-hour urinary copper excretion. The results of these tests may be sufficient to make a diagnosis of Wilson disease (or to exclude it), but patients with indeterminate results will require additional testing, such as a liver biopsy with copper quantitation or molecular testing for <em>ATP7B</em> mutations.</p><p>The general approach to diagnosing Wilson disease, including when to obtain additional testing, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H65234856\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59391355\"><span class=\"h1\">SERUM CERULOPLASMIN CONCENTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 85 to 90 percent of patients with Wilson disease have low serum ceruloplasmin levels (&lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span>. A serum ceruloplasmin concentration less than the laboratory lower limit for normal, most often near 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L),</span> in a patient who also has Kayser-Fleischer rings is considered to be diagnostic of Wilson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. A very low serum ceruloplasmin concentration (&lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> has a higher predictive value than levels near the lower limit of normal for the laboratory and provides strong evidence for the diagnosis of Wilson disease. However, low ceruloplasmin levels can be seen in patients without Wilson disease, and normal or elevated ceruloplasmin levels may be seen in patients with Wilson disease. (See <a href=\"#H59391362\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of serum ceruloplasmin'</a> below.) </p><p>Ceruloplasmin is a 132-kd protein synthesized by hepatocytes and secreted into the circulation. It is the major carrier of copper in the blood, with each molecule of ceruloplasmin carrying up to six copper atoms. Ceruloplasmin bound to copper is referred to as holoceruloplasmin (representing most of circulating ceruloplasmin), whereas ceruloplasmin that is not bound to copper is referred to as apoceruloplasmin. The genetic mutations causing Wilson disease impair the hepatic incorporation of copper into apoceruloplasmin, leading to a reduction in the total serum ceruloplasmin concentration due to the instability of the apoceruloplasmin relative to the holoprotein with its full complement of copper. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Normal values for serum ceruloplasmin vary by age. They are very low during early infancy through approximately six months, then peak in early childhood (approximately 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L),</span> and then decline to the adult range (20 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 200 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span>. Ceruloplasmin is estrogen-sensitive, and levels are elevated in pregnancy and in patients on hormonal supplementation. It is also an acute phase reactant and may be increased above basal levels with inflammatory states. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59391362\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of serum ceruloplasmin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum ceruloplasmin may be low in patients without Wilson disease and may be normal or elevated in patients with Wilson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. As a result, a low ceruloplasmin level is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of Wilson disease, and a normal level does not rule out Wilson disease.</p><p>Serum ceruloplasmin alone has a low positive predictive value in patients undergoing evaluation for liver disease. One of the largest prospective studies to assess the value of serum ceruloplasmin in patients with liver disease focused on 2867 patients, of whom 17 had a low serum ceruloplasmin (&lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span>. Only one of these patients was ultimately diagnosed with Wilson disease (positive predictive value of 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The other patients with low serum ceruloplasmin concentrations had a variety of conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterozygous carriers for Wilson disease (three patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute viral hepatitis (three patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic hepatitis (two patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-induced liver disease (three patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol-induced liver disease (two patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malabsorption (three patients)</p><p/><p>Approximately 10 to 20 percent of asymptomatic heterozygous carriers have serum ceruloplasmin concentrations less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span>. Other causes of low serum ceruloplasmin concentrations include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders that cause marked renal or enteric protein loss, such as nephrotic syndrome or protein-losing gastroenteropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End-stage liver disease of any cause with associated poor synthetic function for production of all hepatic proteins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare diseases such as Menkes disease (an X-linked disorder of copper transport leading to decreased intestinal copper absorption) and aceruloplasminemia (a rare disorder leading to the absence of ceruloplasmin and problems in iron metabolism).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Copper deficiency (eg, due to inadequate copper inclusion in parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>], malabsorption following gastric bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], excessive zinc administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], or idiopathic deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]).</p><p/><p>On the other hand, serum ceruloplasmin concentrations may be normal or elevated in patients with Wilson disease. One cause of normal serum ceruloplasmin in patients with Wilson disease is the presence of acute hepatitis, which can increase serum ceruloplasmin values to the normal range. Other causes include pregnancy, estrogen supplementation, and use of oral contraceptives since the mRNA for ceruloplasmin has an estrogen responsive upstream region for its transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, ceruloplasmin is an acute phase reactant, so levels may be elevated in the setting of inflammation and tissue injury.</p><p>In addition, the method used for measuring ceruloplasmin may influence the results. Serum ceruloplasmin can be measured enzymatically, by antibody-dependent assays, by radial immunodiffusion, and by nephelometry. The results are generally similar, except for the antibody-dependent and the immunodiffusion assays, which may overestimate the ceruloplasmin levels. The overestimation may occur because the two testing methods do not discriminate between apoceruloplasmin and holoceruloplasmin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Determination of ceruloplasmin activity using a method based on oxidation of 0-dianisidine dihydrochloride had sensitivity and specificity of 94 and 100 percent in one report, but more studies are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H236497490\"><span class=\"h1\">SERUM COPPER CONCENTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Wilson disease, the serum copper concentration is decreased in proportion to the reduction in serum ceruloplasmin, despite the presence of copper overload. Measurement of serum copper levels includes both ceruloplasmin-bound and nonceruloplasmin-bound copper. Determination of the serum nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration has been proposed as a diagnostic test for Wilson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, the test is dependent on the adequacy of the methods for measuring both serum copper and ceruloplasmin. The sensitivity and specificity of the nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration for diagnosing Wilson disease have not been well-established. The serum copper concentration can also be used to monitor therapy. </p><p>The nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration is usually determined indirectly. The concentration is estimated from the serum total copper and serum ceruloplasmin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There are approximately 3.15 mcg of copper per mg of ceruloplasmin. Thus, nonceruloplasmin-bound copper can be approximated using the following equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonceruloplasmin-bound copper <span class=\"nowrap\">(mcg/dL)</span> = serum copper <span class=\"nowrap\">(mcg/dL)</span> &ndash; (3.15 x serum ceruloplasmin <span class=\"nowrap\">[mg/dL])</span></p></div></div><p/><p>For Syst&egrave;me International (SI) units:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonceruloplasmin-bound copper <span class=\"nowrap\">(mcg/L)</span> = serum copper <span class=\"nowrap\">(mcg/L)</span> &ndash; (3.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> x serum ceruloplasmin <span class=\"nowrap\">[mg/L])</span></p></div></div><p/><p>The nonceruloplasmin-bound copper can also be measured directly with atomic absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Elevated or normal levels of serum copper in the setting of a decreased serum ceruloplasmin indicate that the concentration of nonceruloplasmin-bound copper is increased. A normal nonceruloplasmin-bound copper level is &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span>. In patients with untreated Wilson disease, the serum nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration is typically above 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (200 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L),</span> though it may be elevated in cases of acute liver failure due to any etiology, in chronic cholestasis, and in cases of copper intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/10,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22</a>]. In patients receiving treatment for Wilson disease, a nonceruloplasmin-bound copper concentration of &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> suggests possible systemic copper depletion.</p><p>A direct method for determining nonceruloplasmin copper is available commercially, but it has not been validated in large population studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Another newer method focuses on copper that can be mobilized from proteins and peptides other than ceruloplasmin using the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), known as exchangeable copper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. This exchangeable copper also can be analyzed further and normalized by the total serum copper, giving rise to the term &quot;relatively exchangeable copper.&quot; This methodology needs larger validation studies, but it may be useful diagnostically as well as for treatment monitoring as it gives direct measurement instead of estimates. This method is not yet available commercially, and data on its use outside of the laboratories where the methods were developed are not yet available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59391898\"><span class=\"h1\">OCULAR SLIT-LAMP EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients in whom Wilson disease is suspected should have a slit-lamp examination for detection of Kayser-Fleischer rings and other ocular manifestations related to Wilson disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59392632\"><span class=\"h2\">Kayser-Fleischer rings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kayser-Fleischer rings are seen in 50 to 60 percent of patients with isolated hepatic Wilson disease and in over 90 percent of patients with clinical neurologic involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/2,4,5,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5,26-28</a>]. Among patients presenting with acute liver failure, Kayser-Fleischer rings are present in approximately half. While highly suggestive of Wilson disease, Kayser-Fleischer rings are not specific for Wilson disease. They have rarely been reported in other chronic cholestatic diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis, and in children with neonatal cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Kayser-Fleischer rings are brownish or gray-green rings that result from fine pigmented granular deposits of copper in Descemet's membrane in the cornea close to the endothelial surface. Copper is primarily deposited in a granular complex with sulfur, which gives the ring its color. They are usually most pronounced at the inferior and superior poles of the cornea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65925\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65925 \">picture 1</a>). Some healthy patients have a dark ring that appears to be in the cornea when examined under moderate magnification in ambient light. However, such rings are not Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are best identified with a slit-lamp examination.</p><p>Kayser-Fleischer rings gradually disappear with effective medical treatment for Wilson disease or following liver transplantation. Their reappearance suggests noncompliance with therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59391905\"><span class=\"h2\">Sunflower cataracts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sunflower cataracts (which represent copper deposits in the lens) may also be seen by slit-lamp examination in patients with Wilson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Their prevalence in Wilson disease is not well-established, and they do not appear to interfere with vision. Like Kayser-Fleischer rings, the cataracts gradually disappear with treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59396783\"><span class=\"h1\">URINARY COPPER EXCRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary copper excretion is useful for the diagnosis of Wilson disease and for monitoring therapy. Wilson disease is typically associated with 24-hour urinary copper excretion of &gt;100 mcg (&gt;1.6 micromol), although lower values have been described in up to 25 percent of asymptomatic patients with confirmed disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/7,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,32</a>]. Values &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/24-hours</span> (0.64 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/24-hours)</span> are suggestive of Wilson disease, and individuals with this finding should undergo further evaluation. Elevated urinary copper excretion may also be seen in patients with other forms of chronic active liver disease and in heterozygotes for Wilson disease, but most often levels are below 100 mcg per 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/8,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,33</a>].</p><p>The 24-hour collection is begun at the usual time the patient awakens. At that time, the first void is discarded and the exact time noted. Subsequently, all urine voids are collected, with the last void timed to finish the collection at exactly the same time the next morning. The time of the final urine specimen should vary by no more than 5 or 10 minutes from the time of starting the collection the previous morning. An inexpensive basin urinal that fits into the toilet bowl facilitates collection for children and for women.</p><p>In order to assess the completeness of the collection, the urinary creatinine excretion should be measured. The 24-hour urine creatinine excretion should be between 15 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight. Values substantially above or below this estimate suggest over- and under-collection, respectively, and should call into question the accuracy of the 24-hour urinary copper excretion result.</p><p>The test should not be used in patients with renal failure. Spot urine collections are highly variable and are not reliable for making a diagnosis of Wilson disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Normal values for urinary copper excretion vary among laboratories but are in the range of &le;30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> (0.48 to 0.64 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A value &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> (0.64 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/day)</span> warrants further investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Care should be taken to avoid copper contamination of the urine collection containers. The container should be rinsed with distilled (not tap) water, or a new, disposable container should be used. Prior to analysis, a small amount of hydrochloric acid (30 mL of 6N solution) may be added to the urine to prevent precipitation of copper hydroxide, which occurs when the urine is alkaline and may result in falsely low urinary copper concentrations. In most patients with neutral pH or acidic urine, this is not necessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59396790\"><span class=\"h2\">Penicillamine challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because urinary copper excretion can be increased in a variety of liver diseases, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> challenge has been proposed as a means to increase sensitivity and specificity. Penicillamine greatly increases urinary copper excretion in patients with Wilson disease, and to a lesser extent, in patients with other forms of liver disease. The penicillamine challenge is rarely used because it is unreliable for excluding Wilson disease in asymptomatic siblings, has not been evaluated for differentiating heterozygous carriers from affected homozygotes, and has not been well-standardized in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/4,33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,33,35</a>]. However, the penicillamine challenge has been standardized in children, where it can be used as an adjunctive test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/9,10,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,36</a>]. </p><p>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> challenge is performed by giving a 500 mg dose of penicillamine (regardless of the patient's weight) at the beginning of the 24-hour urine collection and then again at 12 hours. Urinary copper excretion greater than 1600 mcg per 24 hours (&gt;25 micromol) is much more likely in Wilson disease compared with other types of liver disease. </p><p>In the largest study, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> challenge was performed in 75 consecutive children with a variety of liver problems, of whom 17 were ultimately diagnosed with Wilson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Urinary copper excretion greater than 1600 mcg per 24 hours (&gt;25 micromol) was found in 15 of 17 patients with Wilson disease compared with only 1 of 58 with other disorders (sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 98 percent, respectively). However, when examined closely, the results for the penicillamine challenge added little when the threshold for normal urine copper excretion was lowered to 40 mcg (0.64 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59392394\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While a diagnosis of Wilson disease is established in patients with low serum ceruloplasmin levels, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and elevated urinary copper excretion, additional testing is required in patients with indeterminate results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H65235710\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Interpretation of test results'</a>.)</p><p>Typically, this involves a liver biopsy to determine the hepatic copper concentration and to look for histologic changes suggestive of Wilson disease. Genetic testing also has a role in the diagnosis of Wilson disease, but because of the large number of mutations seen in Wilson disease and its cost, it is generally reserved for those in whom a diagnosis cannot be established in other ways, or to identify mutations within a given family to assist with screening asymptomatic family members. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H59392926\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59395417\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A liver biopsy permits the quantification of the hepatic copper concentration and the examination of liver histology, including staining for copper. Liver biopsies in patients suspected of having Wilson disease should include one biopsy specimen for histology and one for copper quantitation that is at least 1 cm in length. The specimen for copper quantitation should be placed in a dry, copper-free container [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Additional precautions for the specimen to be used for copper quantitation, such as freezing or vacuum drying the specimen, are required to prevent destruction of the tissue since an accurate weight determination is required for the quantitation. In addition, copper content can be determined from paraffin-embedded specimens, which may be helpful when the diagnosis is considered retrospectively, provided enough material is available.

This is generally considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis; however, a lower threshold for copper content increases sensitivity but reduces specificity. </p><p>One study that evaluated test characteristics of hepatic copper determination compared hepatic copper content from 114 liver biopsies from patients with Wilson disease with 219 patients with noncholestatic liver disease, and 26 patients without liver disease (a liver biopsy had been performed for various reasons, but no liver disease was found) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver copper content was &gt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> dry weight in 95 patients with Wilson disease (sensitivity 83 percent), but was between 50 and 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> in 15 patients, and below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> in 4 patients. Liver copper content did not correlate with age, the grade of fibrosis, or the presence of stainable copper.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with noncholestatic liver disease, liver copper content was &gt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> in 3 patients (1.4 percent) and between 50 and 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> in 20 patients (9.1 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients without liver disease, the average hepatic copper content was 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> (0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/g;</span> 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.5-80.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> [0.2-1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/g])</span>. Only two patients with Wilson disease fell within the 95% CI for hepatic copper content of the control subjects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a cutoff of 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g,</span> the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of Wilson disease were 83 percent (95% CI 75-90%) and 99 percent (95% CI 96-100%), respectively. Lowering the cutoff value to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> (1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/g)</span> increased sensitivity, with a small decline in specificity (97 and 95 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>However, as seen in these studies, normal hepatic copper concentrations have been described in rare patients with Wilson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are several possible explanations for this:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reports describing such patients may have been limited by use of older laboratory equipment and use of insufficiently sized specimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There can be variability in copper distribution within the liver, contributing to sampling error (particularly among patients with cirrhosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. As an example, in a report of two patients with acute liver failure undergoing transplantation, the explanted livers showed up to a 630-fold variation in copper distribution in different areas of the liver that were biopsied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute liver failure, massive release of copper from necrotic hepatocytes can lead to normal tissue concentration in biopsy material. However, most patients with Wilson disease with acute liver failure have an elevated copper content (above 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> dry weight liver) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p/><p>Because of potential errors in evaluation of hepatic copper concentration, the hepatic copper concentration should always be evaluated in the context of other diagnostic criteria. Wilson disease is not excluded based solely on a hepatic copper concentration less than 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/g)</span> since approximately 15 percent of Wilson disease patients fall below this cutoff. On the other hand, a copper concentration greater than 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> is virtually diagnostic unless the patient has chronic cholestatic liver disease, which is usually clinically distinct from Wilson disease.

However, the abundance of disease-specific mutations complicates genetic testing. Patients considering genetic testing should discuss the testing with a qualified genetic counselor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In populations with a higher frequency of a predominant mutation, diagnosis of Wilson disease using allele-specific probes for specific mutations in <em>ATP7B</em> may be an option. Since most patients are compound heterozygotes, the identification of one mutation supports the diagnosis, and the identification of two mutations confirms the diagnosis. Predominant mutations have been described in several discreet geographic areas, such as Sardinia, Iceland, Korea, Japan, the Canary Islands, and in some Eastern European populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/35,44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,44-48</a>]. A database of mutations in <em>ATP7B</em> (the gene mutated in Wilson disease) is available <a href=\"http://www.wilsondisease.med.ualberta.ca/database.asp&amp;token=MV8sajeOiJdQT6tqfj1TjJiz3YzP4BVTPiNXJiTcZX60ZUVay76vRU6W8MP2nNwfGbn811OVUDJ/poQxmJhvyQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3591\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">online</a>. </p><p>Haplotype analysis can be useful for establishing the diagnosis in full siblings; however, this testing is mostly supplanted by direct mutation analysis given advances in DNA sequencing. The pattern of genetic markers around <em>ATP7B</em> is determined for both copies of chromosome 13 in the affected proband. Siblings with two matches are affected, those with one are carriers, and those with none are homozygous normal. A positive linkage analysis predicts Wilson disease with 99 percent accuracy in the full sibling. </p><p>Mutation analysis by whole-gene sequencing is another option to identify mutations in <em>ATP7B</em> and is available at some laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H532013531\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows abnormalities in patients with neuropsychiatric involvement but may be normal when the presentation is solely with hepatic involvement.

This scoring system was the first to give weighted numeric values for the testing described above. These include specific biochemical testing (including ceruloplasmin, urine copper, and hepatic copper), clinical manifestations of Wilson disease (presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and neurologic manifestations), and molecular testing for <em>ATP7B </em>mutations. A score of only 1 or 2 after all the testing is done excludes Wilson disease, while a score of 3 suggests further evaluation is needed and a score of 4 or more is diagnostic for Wilson disease. This scoring system has been validated in adults and children and also has been incorporated into European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Wilson disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F105282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105282 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wilson-disease-diagnostic-tests/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wilson disease should be considered in any patient with unexplained liver, neurologic, or psychiatric abnormalities. First-degree relatives of patients with Wilson disease should be screened for Wilson disease.

Results of serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels, slit-lamp examination, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion determine the need for additional testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H65234856\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 85 to 90 percent of patients with Wilson disease have serum ceruloplasmin concentrations below the laboratory limit for normal, typically 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span>. Among patients with less specific clinical manifestations, a serum ceruloplasmin level below 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> is highly suspicious for Wilson disease. However, low ceruloplasmin levels can be seen in patients without Wilson disease, and normal or elevated ceruloplasmin levels may be seen in patients with Wilson disease. (See <a href=\"#H59391355\" class=\"local\">'Serum ceruloplasmin concentration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kayser-Fleischer rings are seen in 50 to 60 percent of patients with isolated hepatic Wilson disease and in &gt;90 percent of patients with neurologic involvement. (See <a href=\"#H59391898\" class=\"local\">'Ocular slit-lamp examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wilson disease is typically associated with 24-hour urinary copper excretion of &gt;100 mcg (&gt;1.6 micromol), although lower values have been described in up to 25 percent of asymptomatic patients with confirmed disease. Values &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/24-hours</span> (0.64 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/24-hours)</span> are suggestive of Wilson disease.

Typically, this involves a liver biopsy to determine the hepatic copper concentration and to look for histologic changes suggestive of Wilson disease.
