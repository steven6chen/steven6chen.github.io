Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is probably the same or similar disease when it begins in patients &ge;16 years of age. Systemic JIA is classified as a subset of JIA, but the pathophysiology is most consistent with an autoinflammatory disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;, section on 'Systemic arthritis'</a>.)</p><p>Children with systemic JIA require close supervision and careful monitoring. Systemic complications, including infections, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), pericarditis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, and other forms of internal organ involvement, are more common in this subtype of JIA than in any other and are associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The clinical course, prognosis, and complications of systemic JIA are discussed in this review. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of systemic JIA are discussed separately, as are oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H815997\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of systemic JIA is highly variable, which has prompted many observers to suspect that systemic JIA is not a single entity. The typical child with systemic JIA experiences a several-month period of spiking fevers and rash, with varying degrees of arthralgia and arthritis. This is often followed by a relative quiescence of the systemic manifestations. However, there are some children who have persistently active systemic disease, which is associated with worse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1381479707\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Generally speaking, there are three disease-course patterns: monophasic, polycyclic, and persistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The actual proportions of systemic JIA patients who follow these disease course patterns are unclear since all studies looking at disease course were single-center studies and the definitions of remission and inactive disease were variable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monophasic course</strong> &ndash; These patients present with active systemic JIA. However, their disease becomes completely quiescent, usually after a period of four to six months, and does not recur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polycyclic course</strong> &ndash; These patients have recurrences of active systemic JIA episodes but have long periods of disease inactivity in between. The inactive periods may range from a few months to years. In all series, this is the least common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Persistent course</strong> &ndash; These patients (usually the most common course) continue to have a chronic course that can take various forms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Systemic manifestations (ie, fever and rash), but little to no arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent systemic manifestations and progressive arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent arthritis despite resolution of systemic manifestations &ndash; Some of these children have relentless destructive arthritis that progresses despite any therapy and require joint replacements at an early age.</p><p/><p>Arthritis resolves completely in approximately 40 to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The child who appears well after six months has a substantial probability of remaining well, whereas the child who continues to have active disease (eg, fevers, arthritis, elevated platelet count, continued requirement for glucocorticoid therapy) three to six months after diagnosis typically has a more difficult course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/4,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9</a>]. However, some children have recurrences even after years of appearing disease free. Thus, many patients who present with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) may, with careful questioning, give a history that suggests that the actual initial onset was in childhood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1381479707\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with systemic JIA who fail to respond adequately to therapy have a significantly poorer prognosis than do children who achieve disease control. In one large, Canadian cohort of children diagnosed with JIA from 2005 to 2010, 71 percent of patients with systemic JIA attained inactive disease within one year, and 47 percent achieved remission within five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similar results were seen in a German cohort of patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2013, with 72 percent of patients reported to have inactive disease at three-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Retrospective and prospective studies have suggested that there is a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; in which early, effective treatment may greatly improve the chances of remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/3,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the past, more than one in three children with systemic JIA developed permanent joint damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and more than one-half required substantial prolonged systemic glucocorticoid therapy (often for years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, significant advances in the treatment of systemic JIA, particularly the use of biologic response modifiers, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> (anti-interleukin [IL]-6 receptor monoclonal antibody), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a> (anti-IL-1-beta monoclonal antibody), and anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist), are felt to have dramatically improved the prognosis in children with systemic JIA. A study of 372 patients with systemic JIA in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry showed that the overwhelming majority of children with systemic JIA are doing well from a disease activity and disability point of view, but there are children who continue to have significant arthritis despite the use of these biologic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, a study of Japanese children enrolled in tocilizumab clinical trials showed that a significant number continued to have radiographic progression, indicating that some children have persistent, destructive disease and may require joint replacement surgery despite the use of biologic therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H816547\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall mortality rate is low in children with systemic JIA, although higher rates are seen in children with more severe disease and in adults with a history of systemic JIA.</p><p>The death rates in cohorts of children with all categories of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) followed in the 1960s and 1970s were approximately 0.5 to 1 percent per year, with approximately 90 percent of the fatalities occurring in children with systemic JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Another study examined mortality outcomes in 49,023 pediatric patients diagnosed with a rheumatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The subset of patients with systemic JIA did not have a significantly increased mortality rate, but this study may have missed hospitalized patients at highest risk of mortality. As examples, there were 3 deaths in 117 patients (two of which occurred after the trial period) and 4 deaths in 190 patients (2 of which were after the trial period) in the clinical trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> (IL-6 inhibitor) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a> (IL-1 inhibitor), respectively, in patients who mostly had severe, refractory systemic JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. A high rate of mortality is also seen in patients with systemic JIA and pulmonary complications, with 17 of 25 such patients dying in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H816554\"><span class=\"h2\">Issues in adulthood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults whose disease began during childhood may have residual problems, including musculoskeletal problems and severe disability.

The clinical and histopathologic characteristics of MAS are similar to those of hereditary lymphohistiocytic hemophagocytosis (HLH). In addition, evidence suggests that there is a shared genetic component in that some patients with systemic JIA and MAS also have protein-altering variants in HLH-associated genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The specifics of MAS as they relate to systemic JIA are briefly discussed here. This syndrome and its treatment are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H23116141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H8905161\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'MAS/Rheumatologic conditions'</a>.)</p><p>MAS typically occurs within the first few days or weeks of the onset of systemic JIA, although it can occur at any point over the course of the disease. Overt MAS occurs in 10 percent of children with systemic JIA but can occur subclinically in another 30 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Some patients have recurrent episodes of MAS. Triggers may include viral or bacterial infections or new medications, but often no inciting event is identified.</p><p>Children may present with spontaneous bleeding, bruising, hepatic dysfunction, lethargy, seizures, coma, or shock. Unremitting fever and rash (unlike the intermittent daily fever and rash of active systemic JIA), lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly are also common findings. The white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and serum fibrinogen typically drop precipitously, and liver function tests become abnormal, while the ferritin level can climb to well over 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (often much higher). There is a paradoxical drop in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) due to fibrinogen consumption, and this can also be an important clue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. On bone marrow examination, numerous benign macrophages exhibit hemophagocytosis, but not all bone marrow specimens from patients with MAS exhibit this finding.</p><p>MAS is difficult to diagnose in the setting of systemic JIA because a systemic disease flare has a similar presentation. Efforts are underway to develop specific diagnostic criteria for MAS in patients with systemic JIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/25,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,30</a>]. The HLH diagnostic criteria cannot be applied to MAS in patients with systemic JIA even though the diseases are similar, because the criteria are too stringent to identify systemic JIA patients early in the development of MAS, when they are most responsive to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The adapted HLH 2004 guidelines require that three of five diagnostic criteria are met. This set of criteria has a sensitivity of 79 percent and specificity of 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The 2004 criteria include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &gt;38.5&deg;C</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenomegaly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytopenia affecting at least two of three cell lineages</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides &ge;265 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen &le;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ferritin &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span></p><p/><p>The preliminary MAS guidelines require that at least two laboratory criteria are met or at least two clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory criteria are met. The sensitivity and specificity of this set of criteria to distinguish between systemic JIA with MAS versus systemic JIA without MAS are both 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The addition of hyperferritinemia (ferritin &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> resulted in a drop in specificity to 50 percent, with a marginal increase in sensitivity to 90 percent, with respect to differentiating the presence or absence of MAS. In contrast, the addition of this criterion increased the specificity with respect to distinguishing MAS from systemic infections from 29 to 95 percent, with a slight decrease in sensitivity from 95 to 86 percent. The diagnostic criteria include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet count &le;262,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">platelets/microL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;59 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White blood cell count &le;4000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhages</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatomegaly</p><p/><p>Treatment is usually initiated with high-dose glucocorticoids (most often &quot;pulse&quot; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> at 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> maximum dose 1 gram, intravenously daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Treatment for refractory MAS in patients with systemic JIA is the same as treatment regimens for HLH that are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H401617\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth retardation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Profound growth abnormalities with obesity and short stature were common complications of disease when glucocorticoids were one of the primary treatments of systemic JIA. They resulted both from glucocorticoid side effects of the therapy and from incomplete suppression of systemic inflammation. These abnormalities are less frequent due to the availability of safer and more effective therapies that allow more judicious use of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Short stature and failure to thrive may still be seen, however, in those with chronic unremitting disease, even in those who do not receive glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence suggesting that the administration of recombinant growth hormone may ameliorate these complications, but usage will probably decrease with the availability of more effective treatments of the disease itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/37-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-42</a>]. Issues of cost and appropriate dosing are barriers to the widespread use of growth hormone in this setting. In addition, damaged joints may grow asymmetrically in response to growth hormone, exacerbating deformity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H401623\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoporosis in children with systemic JIA was common prior to advances in treatment. Measures used in adults to treat osteoporosis are frequently ineffective or are poorly tolerated in children with systemic JIA. The optimal way to minimize this complication is to attain disease control with a minimum of glucocorticoid exposure. Specific options for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in children with systemic JIA include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimizing glucocorticoid administration &ndash; One of the major side effects of glucocorticoids is osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Bone and muscle effects'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth hormone &ndash; This may have a beneficial effect on bone mineral density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], but its use is still considered experimental and subject to the concerns expressed above. (See <a href=\"#H401617\" class=\"local\">'Growth retardation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary management &ndash; A poor appetite often leads to inadequate dietary calcium intake. Gastrointestinal complaints resulting from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and glucocorticoid use are frequently worsened by supplemental calcium-containing vitamins. These nutritional problems can be worsened by arthritis of the temporomandibular joints (TMJ), which can lead to decreased intake when severe. As a result, it is important that parents make sure that the child receives adequate vitamin supplementation and give supplemental calcium separately in children who do not tolerate vitamins with calcium.

However, it may be necessary to prevent recurrent insufficiency fractures. The safety of bisphosphonate use by children remains uncertain. Excessive amounts can lead to osteopetrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The decision to use bisphosphonates must be made on a case-by-case basis since these medications may be teratogenic and have a long half-life, stored in and slowly released from the bone for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32065184\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications such as interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, lipoid pneumonia, and alveolar proteinosis are seen with increasing frequency, although it is unclear whether this represents increased occurrence, better recognition, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-course-prognosis-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
