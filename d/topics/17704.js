Infants who had their central venous catheter removed as soon as candidemia was detected compared with those with late-removal of catheter had a shorter median duration of candidemia (three versus six days).</p><p>Surgical resection of infected tissue may be needed if systemic antifungal therapy is not successful in eradicating the infection or if the infected tissue causes functional impairment. Functional impairment may be seen in patients with a fungal mass causing urinary obstruction or hemodynamic compromise of the right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview systemic antifungal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four different classes of antifungal agents are currently available to treat neonatal candidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyenes &ndash; Polyenes include amphotericin B, which is the most commonly used antifungal treatment for neonatal candidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triazoles &ndash; The most commonly used triazole in neonates is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nucleoside analogues &ndash; The most commonly used nucleoside analogue in neonates is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">flucytosine</a>.

Thus, in each case of candidemia, the species of Candida should be isolated and its antifungal susceptibility should be determined so that the most effective agent can be administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults#H1690258277\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Susceptibility patterns'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Amphotericin B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amphotericin B (also referred to as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a>), a polyene, binds to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane leading to cell leakage and death. Most Candida species are sensitive to amphotericin B, and this drug is efficacious and well-tolerated in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. As a result, amphotericin B is the recommended and most commonly used drug in the treatment of systemic neonatal candidal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Amphotericin is only available in parenteral form. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrate achievement of therapeutic plasma levels with administered dosing regimens between 0.5 and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, although there is patient variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. Successful treatment of systemic candidal infections has been reported using this dosing regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. In patients with preexisting renal insufficiency, the dosing of amphotericin B does not need be adjusted, as serum concentrations are not significantly increased. However, if there is renal toxicity thought to be drug-related, alternate-day dosing should be used in preference to a decrease in daily dose.</p><p>In our practice, we start with an initial dose of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> which is followed in 12 hours by a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> which is then given daily throughout the course of therapy.</p><p>In patients with central nervous system (CNS; or suspected CNS involvement), we consider adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">flucytosine</a> at 50 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day divided into four doses if the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) does not become sterile within a few days or if the patient is becoming more ill on amphotericin B monotherapy at a dose between 1 and 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse effects of amphotericin appear to be less common and severe in neonates than in older children and adults. Although there is a potential for nephrotoxicity and hypokalemia due to renal losses, it appears that most infants display no or transient nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This was illustrated in a retrospective review of 92 infants less than 90 days of age (median gestational age 26 weeks, range 23 to 41 weeks) who received at least three doses of amphotericin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Nephrotoxicity (defined as an increase in serum creatinine [SCr] of 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> developed in 15 (16 percent) patients, and the maximum creatinine values did not exceed 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. In addition, 16 patients (17 percent) developed hypokalemia (defined as serum potassium &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> which was more likely in patients with nephrotoxicity. By the end of amphotericin therapy, SCr levels returned to baseline in eight patients, were decreasing in three patients, and remained elevated in four patients. Amphotericin therapy was not discontinued, and there was no dose reduction in any of the patients. There was no difference between infants who did or did not develop nephrotoxicity in terms of gestational age, birth weight, gender, underlying medical conditions, use of other potentially nephrotoxic medications or amphotericin exposure, and duration of therapy.</p><p>Other reported adverse effects include hypomagnesemia caused by excessive renal losses, bone marrow suppression with anemia and thrombocytopenia, and an increase in hepatic enzymes. These abnormalities are infrequent, dose dependent, and resolve with cessation of the drug.</p><p>Because of the potential adverse effects, while receiving amphotericin B, infants should have serial monitoring with the following lab studies: complete blood count, and serum potassium, magnesium, creatinine, and liver enzymes.</p><p>In infants, the initial test dose commonly administered in older children and adults is not generally given because of the lower rate of infusion-related side effects, and the desire to as quickly as possible reach therapeutic levels of amphotericin B due to the high risk of dissemination and poor outcome of neonatal candidemia. As noted above, we begin with an initial dose of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> followed in 12 hours by a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> which is then administered daily throughout the course of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal duration of therapy is unclear. Most neonatologists and pediatric infectious disease specialists treat for a minimum of 14 days after sterilization of the infected body fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Others suggest that a cumulative dose of 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> be administered, especially in very low or extremely low birth infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The duration of therapy for focal complicated infections, such as endocarditis or renal fungal masses, which are often persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> difficult to eradicate, is also unclear. Because of the difficulty of eradication, therapy is generally prolonged in these infants. Imaging studies can be used to identify fungal abscesses in the kidney, heart, or brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Renal ultrasonography has been used to assess clearance of renal fungal masses, but these studies appear to poorly correlate with the course of the infection and patient outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Nevertheless, treatment should be continued until there is complete resolution of fungal abscesses or masses by imaging studies.</p><p>Based upon the limited data, we treat neonates with candidemia without a complicated focal infection for a minimum of 14 days after the first sterile blood culture is obtained. In patients with a focal infection due to systemic dissemination that is likely to be difficult to eradicate, the duration of therapy may have to be prolonged to 4 to 12 weeks along with surgical removal of the foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Decisions are based upon sterilization of blood cultures as well as eradication of any sign of infection by imaging studies.</p><p>In patients with catheter-associated infection who do not have multiorgan involvement or disseminated disease, a shorter course of amphotericin B (cumulative dose of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> in conjunction with catheter removal provides a favorable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Amphotericin B lipid formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipid-based amphotericin B formulations have the ability to deliver a higher dose of medication with lower levels of toxicity, but are significantly more expensive than standard amphotericin B. They are typically reserved for patients who develop intolerant infusion-related reactions or renal dysfunction during standard amphotericin B administration.</p><p>Data on the use of these agents in neonates are limited to case reports and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. Most reports show that lipid-based amphotericin B preparations successfully treated neonates with candidemia and were not associated with any major adverse effects. However, in a multicenter retrospective review of 730 infants with positive blood, urine, or CSF cultures for Candida species, multivariate analysis showed higher mortality for infants receiving amphotericin B lipid products compared with infants receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a> (odds ratio [OR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.16-3.33) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.18-4.83) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>As a result, we prefer conventional amphotericin B (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-deoxycholate-conventional-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amphotericin B deoxycholate</a>) to the lipid formulation, as the lipid agents do not appear to be superior and may be less beneficial than the less expensive amphotericin B. The lipid formulations should be avoided if Candida infection involves the urinary tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluconazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Fluconazole</a>, a first generation triazole, is the most commonly used triazole in the treatment of neonatal candidal infections. It inhibits the fungal enzyme 14-alpha-sterol demethylase, which is necessary for the production of ergosterol, a major component of the fungal cell membrane.</p><p>In infants with systemic candidal infections, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> is the most commonly used alternate medication to amphotericin B.

In one small trial of 23 infants with proven fungal septicemia, patients were randomly assigned fluconazole (intravenously or enterally) or amphotericin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. There was no difference in patient outcome, with deaths occurring in 3 of 12 patients who received fluconazole and 5 of 11 patients who received amphotericin B. Patients who received fluconazole appeared to have less hepatotoxicity with lower serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations.</p><p>The major disadvantage of this agent is the emergence of fluconazole-resistant Candida species, such as C. krusei, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> prophylaxis to reduce candidal infections may also be a contributing factor to fluconazole resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Candida infection in neonates&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults#H1690258277\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Susceptibility patterns'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> should not be used as the initial sole therapy in an infant with candidemia or suspected candidemia. It should be given only after identifying the Candida species and determining that the organism is sensitive to fluconazole. This is especially important if prior fluconazole prophylaxis has been given to the infant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-candida-infection-in-neonates#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Candida infection in neonates&quot;, section on 'Antifungal prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>Based upon plasma samples of 55 infants (range of gestational age between 23 and 40 weeks gestation), a dose of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day during the first 90 days of life is needed to achieve optimal serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> concentration to treat candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The dosing interval may be extended to 48 hours in extremely premature infants with impaired renal clearance. One small study suggests that administering fluconazole as an initial loading dose, which is routinely used in older patients, was safe and achieved therapeutic levels more rapidly than current regimens without an initial loading dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In this study, an initial loading dose of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> was given, followed by maintenance dosing of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. Further studies are needed to confirm that this is a safe and more effective dosing regimen.</p><p>Lower doses of 3 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> twice weekly may be adequate to prevent candidal infections in preterm infants (gestational age less than 30 weeks). Centers should consider the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of the isolates of colonizing Candida species found in their unit when deciding on dosing regimen.</p><p>Second generation triazoles, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">voriconazole</a>, have been developed with a broader spectrum of activity and increased potency. In adult trials, they are effective in fluconazole-resistant species, but there are not comparable data in neonates.

It is mainly used in combination with amphotericin B in neonates with CNS candidiasis because flucytosine has excellent penetration into the CSF and is synergistic with amphotericin B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-candida-infection-in-neonates/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flucytosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Flucytosine</a> is only available in enteral form, thus limiting its use in critically ill neonates. The oral dose is 50 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day divided into four doses at six-hour intervals. It is critical to monitor blood levels of flucytosine to avoid bone marrow toxicity. Peak plasma concentrations obtained 60 to 120 minutes after administration should be maintained between 40 and 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> and trough levels obtained prior to the next dose should be less than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>.

These agents appear to be well-tolerated with a minimum of adverse effects, because this enzymatic complex is not found in mammals. Resistance to this class of antifungal agents is uncommon.</p><p>Echinocandins include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caspofungin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">caspofungin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anidulafungin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anidulafungin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micafungin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">micafungin</a>, which have all been shown to be effective and safe in adult patients. In neonates, data are limited.
