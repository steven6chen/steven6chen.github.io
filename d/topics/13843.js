Juvenile spring eruption is a variant of PMLE. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile spring eruption (PMLE variant)'</a> below.)</p><p>An overview of cutaneous photosensitivity and a review of other photodermatoses are presented separately.

Fair-skinned individuals are the most commonly affected, although PMLE can develop in individuals of all ethnicities and skin types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It occurs more frequently in temperate areas. Several studies have indicated that the prevalence of PMLE is directly related to the latitude, ranging from 1 percent in Singapore to 20 percent in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/2,3,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5-7</a>]. However, within Europe, a latitude gradient has not been shown to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, and occasionally visible light, have been implicated in the development of polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In most studies, a higher proportion of patients develops the disease in response to UVA than UVB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The eruption may be influenced by the dose and frequency of the UV radiation as well as by the extent and site of irradiated skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. PMLE occurring after exposure to ultraviolet C radiation generated from welding arcs has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous photosensitivity: Photobiology, patient evaluation, and photoprotection&quot;, section on 'Phototesting'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with PMLE appear to have a genetic susceptibility, as evidenced by increased concordance in monozygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, a positive family history is present in 15 to 46 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. Genetic modeling of PMLE in families with photosensitivity disorders suggests a dominant mode of inheritance with low penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A case-control study found a negative association with the <em>GSTP1</em> allele of glutathione-S-transferase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], but a subsequent study was unable to confirm this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Candidate gene analysis of interleukin (IL)-10, Fc fragment of IgG receptor (<em>FCGR2A</em>), selectin-E (<em>SELE</em>), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (<em>ICAM1</em>), <em>IL1A</em>, <em>IL1B</em>, <em>IL1RN</em>, and tumor necrosis factor (<em>TNF</em>)-alpha has been inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>PMLE has many features in common with delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in the skin, suggesting that it may be a cell-mediated immune response to unknown cutaneous photo-induced antigen(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Timed biopsy specimens taken after solar-simulated irradiation displayed perivascular infiltrates of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes within a few hours and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes within days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Increased numbers of dermal and epidermal Langerhans cells and dermal macrophages were also noted. In addition, expression of selectin-E (CD62E), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1; CD106), and ICAM-1 (CD54) on endothelial cells and keratinocytes has also been observed, further supporting the relationship between PMLE and DTH reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>In healthy individuals, exposure to ultraviolet radiation has a suppressive effect on T-cell immune responses in the skin. There is evidence to suggest that in patients with PMLE, this immunosuppressive effect of UV does not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p>It has been postulated that this abnormal response to UV exposure permits PMLE patients to develop an inflammatory response to an endogenous photo-induced antigen, which does not occur in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The photoantigen responsible for PMLE has not been identified.</p><p>Regulatory T cells (Tregs) may be involved in the lack of UV-induced immunosuppression seen in patients with PMLE. One study compared the number and function of Tregs in 19 healthy controls and 30 patients with PMLE before and after undergoing photohardening with narrowband (311 nm) UVB phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although there was no difference in the number of circulating Tregs between healthy subjects and PMLE patients before phototherapy, Tregs isolated from PMLE patients lacked the capacity to suppress effector T cell proliferation. After receiving photohardening therapy, PMLE patients showed a significant increase in the number of circulating Tregs and expression of <em>FoxP3</em> mRNA, an indicator of increased suppressive function.</p><p>The higher prevalence and severity of PMLE among younger women suggests that hormonal factors may be involved in its pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In animal models, 17-beta-estradiol inhibits UV-induced immunosuppression through a dose-dependent reduction in the release of immunosuppressive IL-10 from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) characteristically occurs in the spring and early summer. When it occurs in winter, it usually results from tanning bed exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] or vacationing in a sunny climate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The amount of exposure required to elicit PMLE ranges from several hours to one or two days. Skin lesions typically appear within hours, although they sometimes occur days after sun exposure. The eruption lasts one to several days and then resolves if further sun exposure is avoided. Occasionally, PMLE persists for weeks. Lesions heal without scarring. A characteristic feature of PMLE is that it is most severe in the spring and early summer, moderates as the summer progresses, and resolves in the autumn or winter, only to recur the next spring. </p><p>Sites of predilection for PMLE are sun-exposed areas, including the upper chest, the &quot;V&quot; of the neck, the back of the arms, and occasionally shoulders and lower legs. The disease occurs more frequently in skin that has been covered in the winter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The face and dorsal aspects of the hands are uncommon sites of PMLE, possibly because the hardening phenomenon has occurred from regular sun exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"#H88686364\" class=\"local\">'Photohardening'</a> below). Lesions often recur in the same anatomic locations.</p><p>Several different types of skin lesions can occur in PMLE, but in a given individual the morphology is usually monomorphic and when there is a recurrence, lesions are usually identical to those observed during previous eruptions. Most commonly, patients present with pruritic, erythematous, or skin-colored papules or plaques in a symmetric distribution on sun-exposed skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64270%7EDERM%2F76995%7EDERM%2F51455\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64270 graphicRef76995 graphicRef51455 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Papulovesicles, vesicles, bullae, or confluent edematous plaques (especially on the face) may also be seen. Less commonly, lesions resemble insect bites or erythema multiforme. </p><p>In black and Asian patients, PMLE can also present as pinpoint papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F99549\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99549 \">picture 2</a>), which may also involve the face and the perioral area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. In addition, pruritus without a cutaneous eruption has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. An eczematous form of PMLE does not exist, although eczematous changes can occur as a secondary response to rubbing and scratching. Another unusual variant presenting with pruritic papules and plaques localized to the elbows also has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Systemic symptoms of fever, chills, headache, and nausea are rare but may accompany PMLE. PMLE has a major impact on patients' lives. Compared with the general population, patients with PMLE are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, spend less time in outdoor activities, and take fewer vacations per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H510388056\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin hardening effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continued sun exposure may lead to increased tolerance to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and even to resolution of PMLE, a process referred to as &quot;hardening.&quot; By mid-summer, many patients are clear of the rash due to this phenomenon. The mechanism underlying hardening is not well understood, but is likely due to the cumulative effect of repeated small amounts of UV radiation resulting in increased melanin production, thickening of the stratum corneum, and, possibly, normalization of cutaneous cell-mediated immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) is usually based upon the clinical finding of a pruritic eruption of papules or plaques on exposed skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64270%7EDERM%2F76995%7EDERM%2F51455\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64270 graphicRef76995 graphicRef51455 \">picture 1A-C</a>) and the patient's history of a similar eruption occurring in spring or early summer after sun exposure and gradually improving over the summer months. It is important to exclude other photosensitive skin conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57800 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H452346976\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Skin biopsy may be helpful in some cases, particularly to exclude other disorders. Histologic findings for PMLE are nonspecific and require correlation with clinical presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65837\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65837 \">picture 3</a>). Focal epidermal spongiosis with focal lymphocyte exocytosis and a perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with occasional eosinophils and rare neutrophils may be seen. Papillary dermal edema, focal interface changes, and mild hydropic basal cell degeneration are present in more advanced lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Direct immunofluorescence of skin biopsies is negative.</p><p>Phototesting for the assessment of the minimal erythema dose (MED) is usually normal in patients with PMLE. Provocative phototesting, which tests for the appearance of PMLE lesions after repeated UV exposure, may be used to assist with diagnosis. Provocative phototesting is performed by repeatedly exposing the forearms or &quot;V&quot; of the neck to suberythemal doses of either ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) for four to five days. In over 60 percent of individuals with PMLE, this procedure will elicit clinical and histologic features characteristic of PMLE.

However, actinic prurigo occurs mainly in children and, in contrast with PMLE, tends to persist through the summer and may even extend into the winter months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Actinic prurigo'</a>.)</p><p>The earliest lesions of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F66580\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66580 \">picture 5</a>) may resemble those of PMLE but are less pruritic. There is controversy as to whether patients with lupus erythematosus have a greater potential to have PMLE or whether the PMLE-like lesions are merely part of the photosensitive phenomenon observed in patients with lupus erythematosus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88686147\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1660210\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventive measures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88686153\"><span class=\"h3\">Sun protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sun protection is the first-line preventive measure for patients with PMLE and includes sun avoidance, sun-protective clothing, and sunscreens. Sunscreens should be broad spectrum, with both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) protection. A broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 should be regularly and generously applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. In one study of 15 patients with a history of PMLE, a broad-spectrum SPF 45 sunscreen applied at a dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> prevented PMLE in all subjects after repeated exposure to UVA-UVB radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Sunscreens that contain the non-micronized form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a> or titanium dioxide also offer photoprotection that extends throughout the UV and into the visible spectrum.

Other studies have shown narrowband UVB to be as effective as PUVA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Because narrowband UVB is easier to administer, it is often preferred to PUVA therapy for patients with PMLE. Narrowband UVB phototherapy can be administered three times per week, starting with a dose equivalent to 50 to 70 percent of the minimal erythema dose (MED). The dose is increased during subsequent treatments as tolerated by the patient.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one trial, 21 patients with PMLE were given a seven-day supply of both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> 25 mg and placebo tablets prior to a sunny vacation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The order of administration had previously been randomized by a computer-generated sequence. If patients noted improvement, the initial treatment was continued until symptoms resolved or for a maximum of seven days. Patients were instructed to switch to the other therapy if no improvement occurred after 48 hours. Treatment with prednisolone reduced the mean time to resolution of itch (2.8 versus 5.4 days) and rash (4.2 versus 7.8 days). </p><p>Antimalarials are used for the treatment of some photosensitive disorders, including cutaneous lupus erythematosus, porphyria cutanea tarda, and dermatomyositis.

However, the severity often improves with time. In a follow-up study of 114 patients with PMLE, 57 percent of patients noted decreasing sun sensitivity over the course of seven years, including 12 patients (9 percent) who reported complete resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">JUVENILE SPRING ERUPTION (PMLE VARIANT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;juvenile spring eruption&quot; was first proposed in 1954 for a recurrent springtime eruption on the ears of young boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. This disorder was found to affect approximately 7 percent of school-aged children in New Zealand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. A family history may be positive in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Patients often present in childhood or early adolescence, but initial presentation in young adulthood has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. The lesions are typically erythematous scaly papules or bullae. They occur on the ears (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55229%7EDERM%2F68969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55229 graphicRef68969 \">picture 6A-B</a>), face, and dorsal hands.</p><p>Onset occurs in the spring, and symptoms resolve within several weeks, not to recur until the following spring. Boys are more commonly affected than girls. It has been postulated that this is related to shorter haircuts that expose their ears.</p><p>The diagnosis is typically made on a clinical basis. The differential diagnosis includes herpes simplex viral (HSV) infection and hydroa vacciniforme. Viral cultures may be performed to rule out HSV, but the bilateral localization of juvenile spring eruption is uncommon in HSV infection. Predominantly vesicular lesions that heal with scarring and the lack of predilection for the ears are features more characteristic of hydroa vacciniforme.</p><p>Treatment of juvenile spring eruption is not always necessary due to the transient nature of the disease. Topical corticosteroids may be effective to reduce inflammation. It is important to emphasize sun protection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) is the most common idiopathic photodermatosis. Disease onset usually occurs during the first three decades. Individuals with fair skin are more likely to develop the disorder. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultraviolet A (UVA) is the most common inciting spectrum of light, but ultraviolet B (UVB) and visible light may also provoke PMLE in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PMLE is characterized by pruritic papules, papulovesicles, or plaques that appear hours or days after sun exposure and persist for days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64270%7EDERM%2F76995%7EDERM%2F51455\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64270 graphicRef76995 graphicRef51455 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Systemic symptoms are rare. Continued sun exposure characteristically leads to suppression of the condition over time. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis is primarily based upon the patient's history and physical findings. In some cases skin biopsy or provocative phototesting may also be indicated. The differential diagnosis includes lupus erythematosus, erythropoietic protoporphyria, and solar urticaria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57800 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of PMLE includes preventive measures such as sun avoidance, sun-protective clothing, sunscreen, and treatment of symptoms. Broad-spectrum sunscreens with an SPF of at least 30 should be regularly used. (See <a href=\"#H1660210\" class=\"local\">'Preventive measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who develop frequent exacerbations during the spring and summer, we suggest prophylactic phototherapy in early spring (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H88686364\" class=\"local\">'Photohardening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild active lesions, we suggest treatment with potent topical corticosteroids (groups 1 to 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 3</a>)) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Oral antihistamines may be useful to control pruritus. Patients with acute episodes of PMLE may require a short course of oral corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Juvenile spring eruption is a variant of PMLE that is manifested by erythematous papules or bullae typically on ears of children or adolescents after sun exposure. Symptoms are self-limited and resolve within several weeks. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile spring eruption (PMLE variant)'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymorphous-light-eruption/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gruber-Wackernagel A, Byrne SN, Wolf P.
