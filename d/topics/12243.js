In such cases, the middle ear effusion may persist for weeks to months after the acute symptoms have resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Some children develop chronic OME, defined as OME that persists for three months or longer. The epidemiology of AOM is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>OME is common among apparently asymptomatic young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In three birth cohorts of children who were serially examined with tympanometry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> otoscopy, 90 percent of children (80 percent of ears) had at least one episode of OME by four years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The prevalence ranged from 10 to 17 percent among children through four years of age and then decreased to 3 to 4 percent between six and eight years. Similar rates have been noted in other cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. OME is more common in the winter than in the summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Declines in tympanostomy tube insertion rates among children following universal immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine suggests that the prevalence of OME may have declined from the prevaccine era.

Children with a cleft palate are particularly prone to have chronic OME. The factors that promote persistence of middle ear effusion in patients with otitis media remain incompletely defined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME) is incompletely understood. OME appears to be a multifactorial condition that can result from a variety of inciting events that converge on a common pathway of inflammation, effusion, and tissue hyperplasia. The interplay of inflammation, innate immunity, mucus overproduction, and mucosal hyperplasia all contribute to the development and persistence of middle ear effusion. The classic teaching has been that the effusions of OME result from chronic inflammation in response to residual bacterial components. However, the pathogenesis of OME appears to be more complicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. New evidence suggests that bacterial biofilms have a major role in the pathogenesis of OME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>], and despite being culture negative at surgical intervention, immunofluorescence studies demonstrate bacterial DNA (most commonly from nontypeable <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>) on the middle ear mucosa. Poor clearance of middle ear fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], genetic predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-25</a>], and gastroesophageal reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] also may contribute.</p><p>A bacterial pathogen is identified in approximately one out of three middle ear effusions of children with OME who undergo myringotomy and placement of ventilating tubes; primarily in children younger than two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. The pathogens most commonly recovered include those that typically cause acute otitis media (<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, nontypeable <em>H. influenzae</em>, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis)</em>.<em> </em>A variety of other pathogens, including <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, alpha streptococci, and anaerobic bacteria, may be recovered from children with persistent middle ear effusion.</p><p>Biofilms appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of OME. Biofilm formation by bacterial otopathogens permits persistence and aggregation of bacteria on the middle ear mucosa, often in the absence of positive bacterial cultures. Support for a role of biofilms in the pathogenesis of OME is provided by observational studies demonstrating viable bacteria within a biofilm in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; bacterial DNA, mRNA, and newly synthesized protein in the middle ear fluid of patients with OME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; and mucosal biofilms in biopsy specimens from the middle ears of children undergoing tympanostomy tube placement for the treatment of OME <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent otitis media but not in those of control children undergoing cochlear implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The contribution of allergies to the pathogenesis of OME is controversial. In observational studies, there is an association between allergic rhinitis and OME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. In addition, allergic mediators (Immunoglobulin E, activated mast cells, tryptase, myeloperoxidase) have been detected in the middle ears of patients with OME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25</a>]. However, in an animal model, middle ear challenge with antigenic material did not produce effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, in randomized trials, intranasal glucocorticoids (which are effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis) are not helpful in the treatment of OME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In a systematic review of 15 studies of gastroesophageal or laryngopharyngeal reflux and otitis media, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux appeared to be increased in children with OME compared with the overall prevalence in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In several of the included studies, <span class=\"nowrap\">pepsin/pepsinogen</span> was detected in the middle ear fluid of the majority of children; however, the mean concentration varied widely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264766551\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical signs of acute infection are, by definition, absent in patients with otitis media with effusion (OME). In the majority of patients, OME is transient and does not come to medical attention.</p><p>When patients are symptomatic, the predominant symptom is hearing loss. The hearing loss typically is mild and fluctuating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It may be detected during school hearing screening or audiology screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Although the hearing loss is usually mild, some children with OME present with parental concerns about hearing, language development, behavior, or school performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,10,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,34</a>].</p><p>OME also may be detected during examination after an episode of acute otitis media (AOM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Studies of children with OME demonstrate the median loss to be 25 dB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], which is the equivalent of putting plugs in your ears. In a large prospective study, children younger than three years with bilateral middle ear effusion had hearing thresholds that were approximately 10 to 15 dB higher than similarly aged children without middle ear effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Young children typically do not complain of hearing impairment. However, caregivers may note that the child frequently says &quot;What?&quot;, asks for things to be repeated, has difficulty hearing in noisy backgrounds, or hears things incorrectly if he or she is not looking directly at the speaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,34</a>]. Older children are better able to recognize the mild, fluctuating hearing impairment and report to their caretakers that their hearing is affected.</p><p>The clinical significance of the mild and fluctuating conductive hearing loss associated with OME in otherwise healthy children is debated. Conductive hearing loss may adversely affect binaural processing, sound localization, and speech perception in a noisy background [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35,37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37-40</a>]. However, in a systematic review of randomized trials of tympanostomy tubes for hearing loss associated with OME in otherwise healthy children, there were no proven benefits on language development or cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Although small observational studies have noted that children who have prolonged middle ear effusion have lower scores on tests of speech, language, and cognitive abilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>], the child's home environment appears to have a greater impact on outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

We suggest office-based tympanometry to confirm middle ear effusion before referral to otolaryngology. Tympanometry also may suggest conductive hearing loss; children with flat tympanograms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80293\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80293 \">figure 3</a>) are likely to have hearing loss, although there is not a direct correlation.</p><p>Acoustic reflectometry with spectral wave analysis measures the reflection of sound from the tympanic membrane. Acoustic reflectometry provides a measure of the difference in sound intensity from the incident and reflected sound waves around the frequency of maximal nullification. When the tympanic membrane is normal, approximately one-half of the incident sound is reflected back to the device as a soft, broad-frequency echo; when there is fluid in the middle ear, the tympanic membrane is immobilized and the reflected sound is louder with a narrower spectrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/otitis-media-with-effusion-serous-otitis-media-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

The signs and symptoms of illness and inflammation differentiate AOM from OME. These include bulging of the tympanic membrane, ear pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever. Bulging of the tympanic membrane effectively excludes OME. However, children with middle ear fluid may develop ear pain or fever unrelated to acute otitis media; in these cases it is difficult to distinguish between OME and AOM.
