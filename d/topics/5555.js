An understanding of basic finger anatomy and common injury patterns provides the basis for diagnosing and treating these injuries.</p><p>This topic review will discuss fractures of the distal phalanx. Finger anatomy and other common finger injuries are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extensor tendon injury of the distal interphalangeal joint (mallet finger)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-fingertip-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of fingertip injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subungual-hematoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subungual hematoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=middle-phalanx-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Middle phalanx fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INJURY LOCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal phalanx fractures represent common sports and work-related injuries, accounting for approximately half of all hand fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. These fractures are commonly caused by trauma or crush injuries. The middle finger is most often affected, followed by the thumb. The distal metaphysis, which anchors the complex nail matrix and nail plate, is often affected by distal fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomy of special importance to distal phalanx fractures is described below. A more detailed discussion of finger anatomy is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The range of motion of the distal phalanx is limited in flexion by the flexor digitorum profundus, while extension is limited by the extensor terminal slip. The terminal slip of the extensor tendon inserts on the dorsal surface of the distal phalanx, while the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) inserts at the volar base of the distal phalanx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The FDP tendon causes the distal phalanx to flex after avulsion of the extensor tendon (creating a classic &quot;mallet&quot; deformity). Multiple fibrous septa attach the tuft of the distal phalanx to the volar skin. This contributes to bony stability and minimizes displacement with distal phalanx fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51990\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51990 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51038\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51038 \">figure 2</a>). The nail matrix is the tissue under the nail that permits nail growth and migration. Its longitudinal fibers anchor the dermis to the periosteum of the distal phalanx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76994\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76994 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85578\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85578 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85616 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the distal phalanx are often caused by a direct blow or a crush injury, which can produce significant soft tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A number of other potential mechanisms exist, including lacerations, hyperextension, hyperflexion, rotation, and, less commonly, axial load. An axial load can create a fracture through the base of the distal phalanx with associated displacement and instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a distal phalanx fracture usually complain of pain and swelling at the end of the finger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>During the initial physical examination, the clinician should focus on identifying any complicating factors that require urgent treatment, including: open injury, neurovascular deficits, malalignment, rotation, or dislocation, and tendon dysfunction.</p><p>The neurovascular status of fingers is evaluated using two-point discrimination and capillary refill time. Although values for both of these tests increase with age and certain disease states (eg, diabetes), normal two-point discrimination is approximately 4 to 5 mm, while normal capillary refill is generally less than two seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examination of the distal phalanx should include assessment of the volar subcutaneous tissue. The fibrous septae that connect the bone to the skin create a network of miniature compartments that may swell with blood or fluid, creating severe pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The nail bed adheres closely to the dorsum of the phalanx and may show signs of injury, such as a nail avulsion or a subungual hematoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67759\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67759 \">picture 2</a>). Drainage of the hematoma may relieve pain in some instances. Management of subungual hematoma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subungual-hematoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subungual hematoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whenever possible, the clinician should assess the function of the flexor and extensor tendons of the distal phalanx, as a tendon injury may accompany distal phalanx fractures, particularly if the mechanism involved hyperflexion or hyperextension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73661%7EEM%2F58818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73661 graphicRef58818 \">picture 3A-B</a>). The alignment and rotation of the finger should be carefully evaluated and compared to the opposite hand. A digital block can be performed if significant pain limits the evaluation of alignment or soft tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digital-nerve-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digital nerve block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic evaluation of the distal phalanx should include three views: anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and oblique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56068\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56068 \">image 1</a>). The four most common types of distal phalanx fractures include comminuted distal tuft fractures, longitudinal fractures, transverse fractures, avulsion fractures, and intra-articular fractures of the base (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74772\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74772 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65798\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65798 \">figure 6</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A fracture of the fine cancellous bone at the distal tip of the phalanx is termed a tuft fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56553\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56553 \">image 2</a>). Comminuted fractures of the distal phalanx are common, especially at the tuft, and are generally stable due to the adherence of the fibrous septa. Longitudinal fractures are usually nondisplaced and stable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83105\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83105 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83104\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83104 \">image 4</a>). Transverse fractures should be evaluated for angulation as these are at greater risk of displacement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59451\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59451 \">image 5</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. Widening of the fracture line may indicate entrapment of the nail bed within a transverse distal phalanx fracture. Fractures of the proximal base of the distal phalanx can be associated with tendon injury and may become displaced. These tendon injuries are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extensor tendon injury of the distal interphalangeal joint (mallet finger)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-jersey-finger\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexor tendon injury of the distal interphalangeal joint (jersey finger)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate consultation with a hand surgeon should be obtained for open fractures with extensive soft tissue or bony injury (eg, severe crush injury or comminution) and fractures associated with vascular compromise.</p><p>There is little published evidence upon which to base recommendations for surgical referral of distal phalanx fractures. We believe the following injuries should be referred to a hand surgeon within approximately three or four days of the injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures associated with tendon dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures associated with nerve dysfunction (eg, loss of two point discrimination)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displaced or angulated transverse fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intra-articular fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe nail bed or nail plate injuries</p><p/><p>Transverse distal phalanx fractures that are displaced or angulated can be difficult to reduce due to soft tissue involvement. As an example, a transverse fracture between the terminal insertions of the extensor and flexor tendons is an unstable fracture pattern due to the opposing deforming forces and usually has an apex dorsal angulation due to the greater pull of the flexor tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64224\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64224 \">figure 7</a>). If a fracture reduction cannot be maintained with conservative measures, then referral for surgical fixation is necessary. Transverse angulated fractures are generally treated by inserting a K-wire longitudinally through the fracture and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75518\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75518 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50398\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50398 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All fractures are treated with ice and elevation during the first 24 to 48 hours to reduce soft tissue swelling.</p><p>Nondisplaced distal phalanx fractures should be splinted with the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint in extension for a minimum of three to four weeks. The splint should extend past the tip of the distal phalanx to protect it from injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56147\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56147 \">picture 5</a>). A U-shaped splint can be used to isolate the DIP joint while allowing for full range of motion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Initial splinting may include short-term immobilization of the PIP joint if motion there causes significant pain. Immobilization past four weeks may lead to excessive joint stiffness and some degree of function loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The clinician should not attempt to reduce comminuted fractures of the distal portion of the distal phalanx. The fibrous septae of the distal phalanx or tuft usually support the fragments when splinted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Compression around the tip can facilitate fragment approximation and decrease pain and swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Nail injuries are commonly associated with distal phalanx fractures. Significant nail bed lacerations should be cleaned and repaired. The management of nail bed injuries and hematomas is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-fingertip-injuries#H17719301\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of fingertip injuries&quot;, section on 'Nail bed injury and repair'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subungual-hematoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subungual hematoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of prophylactic antibiotics is controversial. We suggest that systemic antibiotics be used only for open wounds that are either grossly contaminated or occur in high-risk patients (eg, immunocompromised). In such cases, treatment with a first generation cephalosporin for seven days is reasonable. One double-blinded randomized clinical trial involving 193 adults with open distal phalanx fractures found no difference in infection rates between patients treated with prophylactic antibiotics and those who received placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Topical antibiotics may be placed on any wound prior to dressing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most distal phalanx fractures heal well with conservative treatment, which includes approximately three to four weeks of splinting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/4,9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,12,13</a>]. Transverse shaft fractures may require slightly longer immobilization. The duration of therapy is determined by radiologic healing in displaced transverse fractures and by pain-free range of motion and clinical healing in all other fractures.</p><p>Patients with stable fractures should be encouraged to begin moving the joints of the affected digit within one to three weeks to avoid stiffness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. As the finger pulp and nail bed are densely innervated, covering the area with a finger cap or compression sleeve may help to decrease swelling and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Repeat radiographs to confirm that the reduction is maintained are recommended for all displaced transverse fractures treated with closed reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These are obtained at one week and then again at two to three weeks. Otherwise, follow-up radiographs are unnecessary in patients whose symptoms show steady improvement.</p><p>Some distal phalanx fractures fail to demonstrate complete radiographic healing after four weeks despite the absence of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. This occurs most commonly in tuft fractures. Fibrous unions of tuft fractures can take months before ossification is apparent on radiographs. Provided there is improvement in symptoms, this is not a concern.</p><p>We suggest clinical evaluation of all distal phalanx fractures at one week and then every one to two weeks thereafter to evaluate for complications until symptoms have resolved. A referral to hand therapy is suggested for patients with significant swelling, loss of motion, or those in need of more specialized splinting.</p><p>Patients should be advised that some form of nail deformity is possible despite appropriate immobilization and treatment but the full extent of such injuries cannot be determined for four to five months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO WORK OR SPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with transverse fractures should not return to play or strenuous work until there is radiographic healing and the finger is painless, due to the possibility of displacement of the fracture fragments. Patients with longitudinal or tuft fractures can return to play or work, while wearing proper splinting, as soon as symptoms are tolerable. Splints must comply with local regulations, which may vary by sport.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large majority of distal phalanx fractures heal without complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Nonunion is rare and generally occurs with tuft fractures. Other complications that may occur include joint stiffness, numbness and hypersensitivity, and nail deformities. These may create difficulties with fine motor tasks such as buttoning clothes or picking up small objects. Comminuted fractures more often result in poor outcomes.</p><p>As one would expect, fractures that occur as a result of more severe trauma are more likely to involve complications and require additional time for healing. As an example, a study of 98 patients with distal phalanx fractures sustained through crush injuries, penetrating injuries, or lacerations found that fewer than 30 percent of patients had fully recovered at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Full recovery was defined as normal two point discrimination, ability to flex the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint more than 45 degrees, and a normal nail bed. The most common disabilities described were difficulty picking up small objects or managing buttons, pain in the digit during cold weather, and the inability to write normally using a pen or pencil. Most complications (63 percent) occurred in patients with tuft or shaft fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-phalanx-fractures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.
