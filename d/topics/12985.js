Even with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients have a higher risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death than age-matched uninfected controls. Although an increased prevalence of traditional risk factors, such as dyslipidemia and smoking, among HIV-infected patients likely contributes to this increased morbidity, growing evidence suggests that HIV infection and its treatment are directly linked to atherogenesis, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulation abnormalities, probably through inflammation and immune dysregulation.</p><p>Measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients are discussed here. The epidemiology of cardiovascular morbidity and traditional risk factors and the management of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk in HIV-infected patients are addressed elsewhere.

However, HIV patients are generally young and thus have overall low short-term cardiovascular risk and few events. Therefore, many clinical studies rely upon surrogate markers to indirectly assess the burden of cardiovascular disease. These studies have generally demonstrated an increased prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis in HIV-infected compared with uninfected individuals. Such measurements include intima media thickness (IMT) and intraluminal arterial plaque as assessed by ultrasound and evaluation of coronary artery calcification and plaque by computed tomography (CT). These measurements have been moderately associated with coronary atherosclerosis and the future risk of a cardiovascular event in studies of uninfected adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In a meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating subclinical atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients, the following observations were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 13 studies that compared carotid IMT in HIV-infected versus uninfected patients, all except for two reported a trend towards higher carotid IMT with HIV. However, the weighted mean difference between HIV-infected and uninfected patients was very small, 0.04 mm (95% CI 0.02-0.06). Moreover, there was significant statistical and clinical heterogeneity between the studies, including differences in measurement technique and underlying traditional cardiovascular risk factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no difference in the weighted means of carotid IMT measurements from 12 studies comparing HIV-infected patients with or without protease inhibitor exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was evidence of selection bias, with small studies showing an effect of HIV infection and larger studies showing lack of difference.</p><p/><p>Despite the limitations of the meta-analysis, several subsequent large observational studies supported its findings and reported even larger increases in IMT with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. The association between HIV infection and IMT may be modulated by age. In a study of over 1700 HIV-infected patients, carotid IMT was higher compared with age-matched uninfected controls among individuals aged 6 to 29 years but was similar to controls among adults 30 years and older, among whom IMT correlated more strongly with traditional risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, other studies have noted higher IMT among HIV-infected patients, even when adjusted for age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555533145\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of antiretroviral therapy on intima media thickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of ART on IMT appears to vary by agent. As an example, in a randomized trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> was associated with a slower rate of progression of carotid IMT compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a> was intermediate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1396134208\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary artery calcification and plaque</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest that HIV-infected individuals may not have a greater burden of coronary artery calcification than uninfected patients after controlling for traditional cardiovascular risk factors but are more likely to have non-calcified atherosclerotic plaque, which may be more likely to rupture.</p><p>Few studies have evaluated coronary artery calcification, which is detected by CT, in HIV-infected patients. In the meta-analysis discussed above, there was no difference in coronary artery calcification between HIV-infected and uninfected patients in the pooled results from five studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, subsequent studies using CT angiography to assess overall plaque burden have reported a higher prevalence among HIV-infected patients compared with uninfected patients with similar Framingham risk scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. As an example, in a multicenter observational study of 450 HIV-infected and 309 uninfected men who have sex with men between the ages of 40 and 70 years, HIV infection was associated with a higher prevalence of plaque in any coronary segment, as detected by CT angiography, even after adjustment for age, race, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.23) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Specifically, HIV-infected individuals had a higher adjusted prevalence and extent of non-calcified plaque, which was associated with advanced age, lower nadir CD4 cell count, and longer duration of ART. The majority of the HIV-infected men in this study were on ART.</p><p>Statin therapy appears to ameliorate this finding. In a prospective study of HIV-infected individuals, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> was associated with improvement in non-calcified plaque volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25650733\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF VASCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of atherosclerosis that underlies cardiovascular disease and events is a complicated and multifactorial process that involves inflammation and immune dysregulation, endothelial dysfunction, and plaque rupture, as well as the traditional risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This section discusses markers of inflammation, endothelial function, and coagulation that have been associated both with HIV infection as well as with progression to atherosclerosis or cardiovascular events in the general population. Although a number of abnormalities in soluble and cellular markers have been associated with cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients, there are none that have been validated yet for clinical use.</p><p>The prevalence of traditional risk factors in HIV-infected patients is discussed elsewhere.

Active inflammation may adversely affect endothelial cells and promote a prothrombotic environment that leads to atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. HIV infection has been linked to several markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6, which in turn have been associated with cardiovascular events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111728149\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Through positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, arterial inflammation can be detected by increased uptake of a radiolabeled glucose analog, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), in blood vessels. In one study of 27 HIV-infected patients (mean age, 52 years) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and without known cardiac disease, PET imaging was performed and compared with the findings in uninfected patients who underwent PET imaging for other reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Arterial inflammation in the aorta among HIV-infected patients was higher compared with uninfected patients who also had no known cardiac disease and were matched by age, sex, and Framingham risk score but was similar to that seen in sex-matched uninfected patients (mean age, 69 years) who had known atherosclerotic disease. Although aortic inflammation was not associated with levels of CRP and D-dimer, it did correlate with sCD163, a soluble marker of monocytes and macrophage that has been associated with atherosclerosis in uninfected populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111728157\"><span class=\"h3\">Soluble markers</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1593279\"><span class=\"h4\">C-reactive protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRP is the most extensively studied of numerous inflammatory biomarkers potentially linked to underlying atherosclerosis in the general population, among whom elevations in CRP are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events independent of traditional risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-reactive-protein-in-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;C-reactive protein in cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HIV infection has been associated with increased CRP levels when compared with uninfected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Furthermore, in a study of 922 HIV-infected patients followed for five years, a high CRP was independently associated with increased overall mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. With regards to the specific morbidity of cardiovascular disease, the association between CRP levels and myocardial infarction risk in HIV-infected patients was evaluated in a study of a large hospital database that included 487 HIV-infected and 69,870 uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. High CRP (any value exceeding the upper limit of normal of the standard assay or any value in the highest quantile of the high sensitivity CRP assay) was found more frequently among HIV-infected patients (59 versus 39 percent). In an adjusted model controlling for age, sex, race, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, the risk for acute myocardial infarction was increased more than fourfold among patients with HIV infection and increased CRP when compared with patients with neither risk factor. There was no association between CRP level and HIV viral load or CD4 cell count, but protease inhibitor use was associated with high CRP levels.</p><p>The effect of ART in general on CRP is unclear, with some studies showing an increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and others showing a decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Changes in CRP level may depend on the particular agent used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. In a study of 244 patients who had been randomly assigned to initiate one of four ART regimens, increases in CRP at weeks 24 and 96 were observed with regimens containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir-lamivudine</a>, particularly when used with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, in contrast to stable levels with tenofovir-emtricitabine or boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This finding was notable because of an apparent increase in myocardial infarction risk seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> in a large cohort of HIV-infected patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients#H742816\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Abacavir'</a>). However, this study did not analyze the association of such changes in CRP with cardiovascular events, and in fact, the two participants who experienced a myocardial infarction during the study period were receiving tenofovir-emtricitabine and efavirenz. In other studies among patients who had been on long-term ART, changes in biomarkers of inflammation were more likely to be related to personal factors such as smoking and obesity than ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>It is unclear whether the association between CRP and cardiovascular events in HIV-infected individuals differs from that among the uninfected population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1593286\"><span class=\"h4\">Interleukin-6</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 are thought to have a direct causal role in the development of coronary heart disease among the general population (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease#H835935\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Interleukin-6'</a>) and have been observed in patients with HIV infection, particularly with more advanced disease. In a study of 1525 HIV-infected veterans, there was no overall difference in prevalence of increased IL-6 compared with 843 uninfected controls after controlling for age and race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, there was a greater association with increased IL-6 levels compared with the uninfected in the setting of an HIV viral load &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.14-2.09) or a CD4 cell count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.60-3.16). Furthermore, in post hoc analyses of participants in the SMART trial, which evaluated ART continuation versus treatment interruption based on CD4 cell count, increased levels of IL-6 were associated with HIV RNA viremia, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. A subsequent small study suggested that elevations in IL-6 were associated with endothelial dysfunction as reflected by changes in small artery elasticity and endothelial adhesion molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Finally, in a post hoc analysis of samples from two completed HIV trials, IL-6 was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events than D-dimer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Despite the initial hypothesis that the apparent association with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> and cardiovascular events (as noted above) may be related to an increase in inflammation with initiation of the drug, subsequent studies evaluating changes in IL-6 have not supported it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/28,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,38,39</a>]. In an analysis of participants from a study which had previously shown that patients randomly assigned to a regimen containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir-lamivudine</a> had a higher rate of cardiovascular events compared with those assigned to a tenofovir-emtricitabine regimen, there was no difference between the treatment arms in the change in multiple markers of inflammation, including IL-6, from baseline to week 12 of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Another study showed similar decreases in IL-6 levels at week 96 among patients starting treatment regimens containing abacavir-lamivudine versus tenofovir-emtricitabine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7498409\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular activation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7498416\"><span class=\"h3\">T cell activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activation of T cells is a hallmark of HIV infection and levels of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells have been linked to rates of disease progression. During effective ART, levels of activation fall, but not back to pre-HIV levels in most patients, at least during the first few years of treatment. Studies examining the relationship between T-cell activation and atherosclerosis in HIV infection have yielded inconsistent results. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated associations between the proportion of activated and senescent CD8 T cells and carotid intima media thickness and carotid lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7498422\"><span class=\"h3\">Monocyte activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several lines of evidence suggest that monocyte activation may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis in HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22,40,44-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,40,44-49</a>]. Soluble CD163, the extracellular component of the hemoglobin-haptoglobin receptor CD163, is released from activated monocytes and macrophages during inflammation.

In addition, sCD14 levels were associated with progression of carotid intima media thickness (IMT) in a small study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Several studies have reported increased levels of innate immune activation during treated HIV infection and associations between cellular measures of activated monocyte populations and carotid IMT in HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/40,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,46,47</a>]. Additionally, progression of coronary-artery calcium has been associated with higher frequencies of activated monocytes, but not tissue factor expression, T-cell activation, or senescence phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643344862\"><span class=\"h2\">Endothelial dysfunction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10000562\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial dynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a clinical trial of treatment-na&iuml;ve subjects randomly assigned to initiate various ART regimens, there was a rapid and significant improvement in flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery, a measure of endothelial function, during the first 24 weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This improvement in flow-mediated dilation was seen regardless of regimen, suggesting that suppression of HIV, and not the specific drugs themselves, led to improved endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Another study used noninvasive measurement of radial pulse waveforms to assess large and small artery elasticity in 32 treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected individuals and 30 uninfected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. After adjusting for risk factors, including the Framingham 10-year cardiovascular disease risk score, those with HIV infection demonstrated significantly less elasticity in both large and small arteries when compared with the uninfected group. These data suggest that chronic HIV infection, independent of its pharmacologic treatment, induces alterations of endothelial function.</p><p>However, there is evidence for endothelial dysfunction in HIV-infected patients on therapy as well. Increased pulse wave velocity, which may be an early marker for atherosclerosis, has been noted in two small studies of HIV-infected patients taking ART compared with uninfected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Cumulative duration of ART exposure was associated with an incremental increase in velocity, supporting a role of HIV therapy in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction.</p><p>Certain antiretroviral agents may be more highly associated with abnormal endothelial function than others.

A positive correlation has also been noted between HIV viral load and prothrombin fragment in 90 HIV-infected individuals (mean age 38 &plusmn; 9 years, mean CD4 216 &plusmn; 198) not receiving ART, which suggests that increasing levels of viremia may increase the risk for thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Moreover, increased D-dimer levels in the setting of treatment interruption and increased fibrinogen levels have been associated with increased mortality in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/24,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,34</a>]. Additionally, in a case-control study of HIV-infected patients who had experienced a cardiovascular event (n = 52) or had not (n = 104), D-dimer was independently associated with cardiovascular event risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>However, not all changes in markers of coagulation in the setting of HIV infection suggest a hypercoagulable state. In a study of 278 HIV-infected men, levels of antithrombin were higher and levels of a functional measure of thrombin generation were lower compared with 39 uninfected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, it is unclear what the impact of ART is on coagulation.

Chronic immune stimulation increases TF expression on the surface of monocytes. In a study of 121 HIV-infected adults, higher concentrations of TF were associated with subclinical atherosclerosis (assessed by carotid intima media thickness) and correlated with longer duration of ART and lower nadir CD4 counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10000612\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors associated with atherosclerosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10000627\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral co-infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of ongoing inflammation secondary to the presence of other chronic viral infections may also promote the development of atherosclerosis and subclinical cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients.</p><p>Asymptomatic infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been associated with cardiovascular morbidity in both the HIV-infected and general population. In a study of 6111 HIV-infected individuals, of whom 5119 (82 percent) were seropositive for CMV, seropositivity was independently associated with non-AIDS events, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Studies evaluating the pathogenesis of this association have suggested a potential role in atherogenesis. In a study of 93 HIV-infected patients (91 percent men and 94 percent on ART), greater CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses against CMV were independently associated with increased carotid IMT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. In a separate study of 601 HIV-infected women with positive CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) serology, higher levels of CMV IgG were independently associated with carotid artery stiffness but not carotid IMT as measured by carotid ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. No such association was seen in 90 uninfected controls matched for age and race. That study also found that CMV IgG levels were associated with carotid artery lesions only among HIV-infected patients who had viral suppression on ART, not those who were untreated or continued to be viremic despite ART. This suggests that decreased HIV viral replication may be mediating the relationship between an enhanced immune response against CMV and vascular disease.</p><p>Other viruses that have been implicated in the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients include herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-biomarkers-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].
