Babies with a congenital hernia of the diaphragm have a hole in their diaphragm. Because of this, some of the organs from the belly can move through this hole into the chest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82792\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82792 \">figure 1</a>). In the chest, these organs can press on the lungs and keep them from growing normally.</p><p>A congenital hernia of the diaphragm can be mild or severe. A severe congenital hernia of the diaphragm is life threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12979111\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a congenital hernia of the diaphragm?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before birth, a congenital hernia of the diaphragm causes no symptoms. The doctor might find out your baby has it when he or she does a routine test, called an ultrasound, to check on your baby during pregnancy. An ultrasound is an imaging test that creates pictures of your baby inside the uterus.</p><p>After birth, the most common symptom that a baby might have is trouble breathing. This usually starts within a few hours after birth. Some babies have mild trouble breathing, but most babies have severe trouble breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12979126\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a congenital hernia of the diaphragm?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor can do a chest X-ray to check if your baby has this condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12979141\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a congenital hernia of the diaphragm treated during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During pregnancy, your doctor will monitor your baby's health with regular tests. But there is no treatment for this condition during pregnancy.</p><p>As your due date nears, your doctor will probably talk with you about giving you medicines to help start your labor. Doctors call this &quot;inducing labor.&quot; Doctors usually induce labor when a baby has a congenital hernia of the diaphragm. That way, the doctors who take care of your baby can be ready to start treatment right after birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12979156\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a congenital hernia of the diaphragm treated after birth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your baby's symptoms and how severe the condition is. It usually involves different steps.</p><p>First, the doctor will treat your baby's breathing and other lung problems. Treatments usually include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A breathing tube &ndash; A breathing tube is a tube that goes down the throat and into the lungs. The other end is attached to a machine that helps with breathing. Doctors use the term &quot;intubation&quot; for this.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nasogastric tube (or NGT) &ndash; This is a thin tube that goes in the nose and down into the stomach. The tube sucks up extra fluid and air in the stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intravenous (IV) line &ndash; This is a thin tube that goes into a vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An umbilical line &ndash; This is a thin tube that goes into a blood vessel in the umbilical cord.</p><p/><p>If the breathing tube doesn't help enough, your baby might need to be put on a heart and lung machine. This machine, which doctors call &quot;ECMO,&quot; takes over the jobs of the heart and lungs. It pumps blood from your baby's body, gives it oxygen, and pumps it back into the body.</p><p>After your baby's breathing and other lung problems are under control, he or she will need surgery. Surgery is usually done a few days after birth, but the timing depends on your baby's individual situation. During surgery, the doctor will put the belly organs back in the belly and close the hole in the diaphragm.</p><p>After surgery, babies usually need a breathing tube or to be on a heart and lung machine while they heal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12979171\"><span class=\"h1\">Does a congenital hernia of the diaphragm cause long-term problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. It will depend on your baby's individual situation. But many babies with a congenital hernia of the diaphragm will have long-term problems. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing or other lung problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not gaining weight or growing normally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digestive problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learning problems or hearing loss</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12979186\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=going-home-from-the-hospital-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Going home from the hospital (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
