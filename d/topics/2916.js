As an example, in one series of over 12,000 autopsies, only seven were identified, for an incidence of less than 0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In symptomatic patients, a mass can virtually always be detected by echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography (CT). Because symptoms may mimic other cardiac conditions, the clinical challenge is to consider the possibility of a cardiac tumor so that the appropriate diagnostic test(s) can be conducted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specific signs and symptoms of cardiac tumors generally are determined by the location of the tumor in the heart and not by its histopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12461184\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of symptom production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac tumors may cause symptoms through a variety of mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolization, which is usually systemic but can be pulmonic.

Left atrial tumors thus may simulate mitral valve disease and produce heart failure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> secondary pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and prognosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Commonly observed symptoms and signs include dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, pulmonary edema, cough, hemoptysis, edema, and fatigue. Symptoms may be worse in certain body positions due to motion of the tumor within the atrium. On physical examination, a characteristic &quot;tumor plop&quot; may be heard early in diastole. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to interfering with the circulation, left atrial tumors may release tumor fragments or thrombi into the systemic circulation. The most serious complications of such embolization are neurologic. This was illustrated by a series of 74 consecutive patients with atrial myxomas from the Mayo Clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Central nervous system complications were identified in nine patients (12 percent), and in seven of these the neurologic symptoms were the initial manifestation of the myxoma. Two of these nine patients had evidence of systemic myxomatous tumor embolization in addition to their neurologic symptoms.</p><p>Benign myxomas are the most common tumors arising in the left atrium (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Myxomas'</a> below). However, other benign and malignant tumors can simulate myxomas and should be considered in the differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Right atrial tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumors arising in the right atrium grow into the atrial lumen and obstruct blood flow, producing hemodynamic changes that are similar to those seen with tricuspid stenosis.</p><p>Typical cardiovascular signs and symptoms are those of right heart failure (ie, fatigue, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, ascites, and prominent &quot;a waves&quot; in the jugular veins). On physical examination, a diastolic murmur has been described, which is similar to the &quot;tumor plop&quot; heard with left atrial myxomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricuspid-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricuspid stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to obstructing circulation through the right side of the heart, tumor fragments may be released into the pulmonary circulation, causing symptoms consistent with pulmonary emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Right atrial hypertension can result in shunting of venous blood into the systemic circulation if a patent foramen ovale (or atrial septal defect) is present, resulting in hypoxemia or systemic emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Myxomas are the most common tumors of the right atrium. However, sarcomas, and in particular, angiosarcomas, have been reported to arise in the right atrium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Right ventricular tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions arising in the right ventricle most commonly interfere with filling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> outflow from the right ventricle, resulting in right-sided heart failure. </p><p>Typical signs and symptoms may include peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, ascites, shortness of breath, syncope, and sudden death. Tumors arising in the right ventricle can be misdiagnosed as pulmonic stenosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or tricuspid regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonic stenosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-restrictive-cardiomyopathy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumors arising in the left ventricle may be intramural and present with arrhythmias or conduction defects. Alternately, left ventricular tumors may be intracavitary and present with systemic embolization or outflow obstruction. Syncope or left ventricular failure may be observed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the initial evaluation are to ascertain whether or not a cardiac tumor is present, the location of the lesion within the heart and, to the extent possible, whether a tumor is benign or malignant. This information is vital in planning further evaluation and management. </p><p>Echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrafast computed tomography (CT) provide complementary information to address these questions. Most adults having heart operations of any kind will have coronary angiography as part of the routine preoperative evaluation. For those with epicardial tumors, coronary angiography is specifically required to assess the location of the tumor&rsquo;s nutrient vessels and any that are parasitized by the tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography is widely available and provides a simple, non-invasive technique for the initial evaluation. Echocardiography images both the myocardium and the cardiac chambers and can usually identify the presence of a mass and its mobility. In addition, echocardiography may provide information about any obstruction to the circulation, as well as the likelihood that the tumor could be a source of emboli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-atria-and-appendages#H11278595\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the atria and appendages&quot;, section on 'Left atrial masses and tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Although transthoracic echocardiography is simpler and usually can identify a tumor, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be more informative. The superior diagnostic utility of TEE is due to the proximity of the esophagus to the heart, the lack of intervening lung and bone, and the ability to use high-frequency imaging transducers that afford superior spatial resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography: Indications, complications, and normal views&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac MRI and CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although both cardiac MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>] and ultrafast CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] provide non-invasive, high resolution images of the heart, MRI generally is preferred. In addition to furnishing detailed anatomic images, the T1- and T2-weighted sequences reflect the chemical microenvironment within a tumor, thereby offering clues as to the type of tumor that is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/6,17,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17,18,21</a>]. However, CT scanning is still useful when MRI is not immediately available or is contraindicated. An excellent pictorial review of many cardiac tumors and comparison of MRI and CT scanning has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive coronary imaging with cardiac computed tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The utility of information derived from echocardiography, MRI, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CT is illustrated by several examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The location of myxomas within the atrial lumen facilitates their diagnosis by echocardiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53539\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef53539 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58730\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef58730 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71550\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef71550 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53680\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef53680 \">movie 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64739\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64739 \">movie 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73495\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73495 \">movie 6</a>).

Significant involvement of coronary arteries with tumor may require resection and grafting of such arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Transvenous biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data are available on the risks and benefits of transvenous biopsy of suspected cardiac tumors. Because myxomas may embolize, transvenous biopsy is not generally warranted if the appearance is typical on non-invasive imaging. Biopsy is considered reasonable for other cardiac tumors if potential benefits are deemed sufficient to outweigh potential risks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endomyocardial-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endomyocardial biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The information obtained from echocardiography and cardiac MRI or CT can confirm the presence of a cardiac tumor and its location within the heart, and may provide an initial indication of the type of tumor. Transvenous biopsy may be helpful in certain situations. In general, the information from non-invasive imaging is sufficient to make a decision regarding the need for surgery, where a definitive histologic diagnosis can be established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">BENIGN TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over 75 percent of primary cardiac tumors are benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/36-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-41</a>]. In adults, the majority of benign lesions are myxomas; other common benign lesions include papillary fibroelastomas and lipomas. In children, rhabdomyomas and fibromas are the most common; malignant tumors are very rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Myxomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac neoplasm. Histologically, these tumors are composed of scattered cells within a mucopolysaccharide stroma. The cells originate from a multipotent mesenchyme that is capable of neural and endothelial differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Myxomas produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which probably contributes to the induction of angiogenesis and the early stages of tumor growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>Macroscopically, typical myxomas are pedunculated and gelatinous in consistency; the surface may be smooth, villous, or friable. Tumors vary widely in size, ranging from 1 to 15 cm in diameter, and weigh between 15 and 180 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. About 35 percent of myxomas are friable or villous, and these tend to present with emboli. Larger tumors are more likely to have a smooth surface and to be associated with cardiovascular symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardiovascular manifestations depend upon the anatomic location of the tumor. Approximately 80 percent of myxomas originate in the left atrium, and most of the remainder are found in the right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/6,11,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,47-49</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Left atrial tumors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Right atrial tumors'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to their cardiovascular effects, patients with myxomas frequently have constitutional symptoms (eg, weight loss, fever) and laboratory abnormalities that suggest the presence of a connective tissue disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Although the etiology of these symptoms is not fully understood, the production of various cytokines and growth factors by the tumor may contribute to these clinical and laboratory abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/45,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,51</a>].</p><p>The relative frequencies of different signs and symptoms associated with left atrial myxomas are illustrated by a series of 112 patients, 72 of whom were women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular symptoms were present in 67 percent. Most commonly, these resembled symptoms of mitral valve obstruction and were frequently associated with electrocardiographic evidence of left atrial hypertrophy. Although auscultatory abnormalities were found in 64 percent, the classic tumor &quot;plop&quot; was identified in only 15 percent.

Despite the greater frequency of myxomas in women, men were more likely to have evidence of embolization. With myxomas, the incidence of embolization is associated with smaller size (&le;4.5 cm) and softer tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss) were seen in 34 percent of patients.

While some recommend surgery for all patients because of the risk of embolization and associated morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/64-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-68</a>], others have suggested that careful observation is an acceptable option for asymptomatic patients, as long as the tumor remains small and non-mobile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Surgery is recommended for patients who have had embolic events or complications directly related to tumor mobility (eg, coronary ostial occlusion), and those with highly mobile or large (&ge;1 cm) tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/27,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,63</a>].

With increasing use of ultrasound and improvements in technique and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), these tumors are being detected with increasing frequency, even in the prenatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/69,71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,71-74</a>]. Rhabdomyomas are usually found in the ventricular walls or on the atrioventricular valves. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Most rhabdomyomas regress spontaneously, and resection is usually not required unless a child is symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/70,74-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,74-77</a>]. Symptoms, if present, are caused by obstruction of blood flow through the heart or consist of rhythm disturbances, such as heart block of ventricular tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/70,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibromas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although uncommon, fibromas are nevertheless the second most common pediatric cardiac tumor and can also occur in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/47,78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,78-80</a>]. Histologically, these are similar to fibromas arising elsewhere in the body. Fibromas usually arise in the ventricular muscle and may become quite large. Unlike rhabdomyomas, fibromas do not regress spontaneously. They arise approximately five times more frequently in the left ventricle than the right ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Heart failure is the most common symptom, due to obstruction of blood flow or interference with valvular function. Myocardial dysfunction and conduction disturbances also occur. Echocardiography, supplemented with computed tomography (CT) scans or MRI confirms the diagnosis. Symptomatic tumors should be resected. Complete resection of very large tumors may require cardiac transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Teratoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Teratomas are tumors of embryonic origin derived from two or three germinal layers. Cardiac teratoma is a rare, generally benign tumor with most reported cases presenting as fetal or neonatal tumors; in adults they are estimated to constitute less than 1 percent of cardiac tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Nearly all cardiac teratomas arise within the pericardium, with the remainder in the myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/82-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1932844259\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal and neonatal intrapericardial teratoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although these tumors are generally benign, they tend to grow rapidly (ie, significant growth over a few weeks) and can have serious mechanical consequences either by causing tamponade or through direct pressure on the heart with consequent reduced cardiac output, fetal hydrops, and death. Intrapericardial teratomas are typically located in the region of the pericardial reflection at the junction of the ascending aorta and right atrial appendage, which leads to compression of the right side of the heart as the teratoma grows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Thus, there is a risk of death in-utero or immediately after birth.</p><p>Treatment therefore requires timely detection and resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. When a small suspected teratoma is detected, frequent serial assessment is required to detect changes in tumor size and cardiac output, prior to the onset of hydrops. An increase in tumor size and a declining or abnormally low cardiac output are indications for tumor resection, ideally prior to development of signs of hydrops. The tumor can be removed by fetal tumor excision, an ex-utero intrapartum therapy (EXIT) approach (which involves uterine hysterotomy, continued uteroplacental support during surgical tumor excision, followed immediately by delivery), or by early postnatal surgery, with timing dictated by tumor size and the patient&rsquo;s hemodynamic condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/84,86,88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,86,88,89</a>]. Because teratomas usually have a single blood supply, are well encapsulated, and are not invasive, properly timed tumor surgery is typically straightforward and successful. </p><p>By contrast, other approaches may not be therapeutic. For example, drainage of the cystic component of a teratoma may not relieve tamponade and will not stop tumor growth. Pericardiocentesis may not relieve tamponade if tumor mass is not removed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607327442\"><span class=\"h3\">Other cardiac teratomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scant reports are available on adult cases of benign cardiac teratoma, which are predominantly pericardial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/81,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,90</a>]. In adults, cardiac teratoma may grow slowly and may be detected as an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient. Symptoms such as chest pain or dyspnea may develop due to associated pericardial effusion.</p><p>Intramyocardial teratomas have been rarely diagnosed in newborns, children, and adults. These tumors may cause heart failure or an arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. </p><p>The primary treatment for benign cardiac teratoma is surgical excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/81,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,91</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Purkinje cell tumors/hamartomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These tumors consist of small, flat sheets of cells most frequently located in the left ventricle, and on the endocardial and epicardial surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. As such, they are undetectable by echocardiographic or radiologic techniques. These are usually tumors of young children and present with incessant ventricular tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Electrocardiograms often demonstrate a bundle branch pattern (right bundle branch block when the tumor is in the left ventricle). Electrophysiologic studies can localize the tumors, facilitating surgical excision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipomas and fibrolipomas are characterized by a predominance of benign fatty cells. About half of these tumors occur in the subendocardial region with the remainder evenly divided between the myocardial and subepicardial regions. They may also occur on valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. Although most are no more than a few centimeters in size, lipomas as large as 4.8 kg have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>Symptoms, when present, are generally related to local tissue encroachment (arrhythmias, conduction block, sudden death) although valvular tumors can cause insufficiency and symptoms of heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. The diagnosis can be made with echocardiography and the distinctive fat pattern seen on MRI. Because of the symptoms they cause and their progressive growth, myocardial lipomas require resection.</p><p>Pericardial lipomas are typically an incidental finding and clinically insignificant. Rarely, a pericardial lipoma can assume gigantic proportions and its appearance on a chest radiograph may be mistaken for a huge pericardial effusion or massive cardiomegaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89414\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89414 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89413\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89413 \">image 3</a>). Benign pericardial lipomas can infiltrate the myocardium. If the ventricular septum is invaded, communication between the pericardial space and the right ventricular cavity may result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum is an exaggerated growth of normal fat existing within the septum and is not a true tumor. Rather, it is a developmental disorder caused by expansion of adipose tissue trapped in the interatrial septum during embryogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. The septal hypertrophy may be as large as 2 cm in thickness and is seen primarily in older patients and in those who are obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>]. It has been suggested that this disorder is associated with the presence of coronary artery disease in proportion to the degree of atrial septal thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p>Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum is indistinguishable from lipoma except that the former occurs in the atrial septum with a typical distribution (generally sparing the fossa ovalis). In the absence of symptoms of atrial arrhythmias, heart block, or rare vena caval obstruction, they do not require resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Other pseudoneoplasms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are other pseudoneoplasms (like lipomatous hypertrophy) as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. These include inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, hamartoma of mature cardiac myocytes, calcified amorphous tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>], and <span class=\"nowrap\">mesothelial/monocytic</span> incidental cardiac excrescences. But unlike lipomatous hypertrophy, these four tumors require resection to distinguish them from neoplasms or to prevent embolization or obstruction of blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. This is also true of the rare intracardiac blood cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">TUMORS THAT MAY BE EITHER BENIGN OR MALIGNANT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Paragangliomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors that can be either benign or malignant and can be hormonally active or inactive. In tumors not producing catecholamines, symptoms are due to cardiac compression or tamponade. By contrast, cardiac paragangliomas that are hormonally active primarily produce norepinephrine and may cause systemic symptoms (eg, headache, sweating, tachycardia, hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

Paragangliomas may be localized with echocardiography. Their extreme vascularity creates a characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/89,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,107</a>]. Coronary angiography is required to plan the operative resection. (See <a href=\"#H3810676\" class=\"local\">'Coronary angiography'</a> above.)</p><p>Both benign and malignant paragangliomas occurring within the pericardium parasitize the cardiac blood supply and are, as a consequence, very difficult to excise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/107-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">107-109</a>]. All intrapericardial paragangliomas require resection. Complete resection may be difficult, but is usually possible. Cardiopulmonary bypass and even circulatory arrest may be required because of the high degree of vascularity, or to moderate the extreme hypertension possible from tumor manipulation or hormonally active tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,110</a>]. If complete resection is not possible, cardiac transplantation may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. As is true of all pheochromocytoma resections, preoperative and intraoperative adrenergic blockade must be employed.

Although a causal relationship between asbestos exposure and pleural mesotheliomas is well established, the relationship between asbestos exposure and pericardial mesothelioma is less certain.</p><p>Mesotheliomas arising in the pericardium produce tamponade and constriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/112-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">112-115</a>].

Larger series of 95 patients and over 500 patients have shown similar and very poor long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/128,149\" class=\"abstract_t\">128,149</a>].</p><p/><p>The poor results with surgical resection have led to occasional attempts to treat patients with cardiac transplantation, if extracardiac disease is not present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/144,150-154\" class=\"abstract_t\">144,150-154</a>]. Most of these patients have undergone chemotherapy and radiation prior to transplantation. In the largest series, results of cardiac transplantation in patients with malignant tumors (most of which were sarcomas) were evaluated in a review of 21 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. Although mean survival was only 12 months, seven patients were free of recurrent malignancy at a mean follow-up of 27 months.</p><p>An alternative treatment, cardiac autotransplantation, has shown promise. In these cases, the heart is excised, the tumor is resected ex vivo, and the heart is reconstructed before being reimplanted. The advantage of this procedure is the increased ease with which major resection and reconstruction can be performed, while at the same time avoiding the need for antirejection treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/155,156\" class=\"abstract_t\">155,156</a>].</p><p>Another promising adjunct in operative therapy is to plan the complex operative strategy (in a Schwannoma) by creating a 3-D printer reproduction of the heart and tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Other primary cardiac tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary lymphomas arising in the myocardium have been reported. In a review of 40 cases identified from the literature between 1995 and 2002, the outlook was generally poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. However, 38 percent of cases achieved a complete response with systemic therapy. At least some of these responses may be durable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/158-160\" class=\"abstract_t\">158-160</a>].</p><p>Other tumors may also arise in the heart, including paragangliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/161,162\" class=\"abstract_t\">161,162</a>] and extramedullary plasmacytomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/163-165\" class=\"abstract_t\">163-165</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">SECONDARY CARDIAC TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to primary malignant cardiac tumors, metastatic involvement of the heart is relatively common. As an example, in one of the largest autopsy series of over 1900 patients dying of cancer, 8 percent had metastatic disease involving the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Cardiac involvement may arise from hematogenous metastases, direct invasion from the mediastinum, or tumor growth into the vena cava and extension into the right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/166\" class=\"abstract_t\">166</a>].</p><p>Malignant melanomas are particularly likely to metastasize to the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/125,163,167,168\" class=\"abstract_t\">125,163,167,168</a>]. Other solid tumors commonly associated with cardiac involvement include lung cancer, breast cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, renal carcinoma, esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>]. There is also a high prevalence of secondary cardiac involvement with leukemia and lymphoma.</p><p>Cardiac or pericardial metastasis should be considered whenever a patient with known malignancy develops a pericardial effusion, any cardiovascular symptom, or signs such as a new or changing heart murmur, electrocardiographic conduction delay, or arrhythmia. The development of cardiomegaly on chest radiograph should suggest pericardial effusion. Emboli thought to originate in the heart should also raise the possibility of cardiac involvement with tumor. Cardiac metastases rarely may be the first manifestation of malignant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>].</p><p>The specific symptoms will reflect the site of cardiac involvement, in a manner analogous to primary cardiac tumors. The diagnostic evaluation is the same as that for primary cardiac tumors and relies upon echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) to ascertain the extent of cardiac involvement. In very carefully selected patients, resection of cardiac metastases has been used to provide symptom palliation and prolong life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/125,171,172\" class=\"abstract_t\">125,171,172</a>].</p><p>Other causes of cardiac symptoms must also be considered. In particular, metastatic disease must be distinguished from the cardiotoxicity that may be associated with chemotherapeutic agents, particularly anthracyclines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, monitoring, and diagnosis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors involving the heart may cause symptoms by obstruction of circulation, interference with heart valves, direct invasion of the myocardium, invasion of adjacent lung, embolization, or by the production of constitutional symptoms. Except for tumors with constitutional symptoms, the signs and symptoms of a cardiac tumor are generally determined by the location of the tumor in the heart rather than by its histopathology. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a cardiac tumor is suspected, imaging procedures are used to determine whether or not a mass is present and where the tumor is located within the heart. Echocardiography is the simplest technique for such evaluation; cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrafast computed tomography (CT) provide more detailed information. Tumors that occur from or invade the epicardial surface of the heart require coronary angiography preoperatively to define distortion of the coronary arteries and determine coronary blood supply of the tumor. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over 75 percent of cardiac tumors are benign, and the majority of these are myxomas. About 80 percent of myxomas arise in the left atrium and most of the remainder are found in the right atrium. Myxomas are managed with prompt surgical resection because of the risk of embolization or other cardiovascular complications. A number of other benign lesions may also occur. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Myxomas'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Benign tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary malignant tumors of the heart are rare; most of these are sarcomas. Primary sarcomas arising in the heart generally are rapidly progressive and cause death through infiltration of the myocardium, by obstructing circulation, or by distant metastases. When feasible, treatment is surgical, although most of these tumors recur relatively rapidly. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Sarcomas'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metastatic involvement of the heart is relatively frequent and may result from hematogenous spread, direct invasion, or tumor growth through the vena cava into the right atrium. Cardiac or pericardial metastases should be considered whenever a patient with known malignancy develops cardiovascular symptoms. As with primary cardiac tumors, specific signs and symptoms reflect the site of cardiac involvement. (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Secondary cardiac tumors'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Reynen K.
