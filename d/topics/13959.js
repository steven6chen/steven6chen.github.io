Postpartum psychosis (or puerperal psychosis) is most often seen in patients that have been or will be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but can also occur in women with a major depression with psychosis, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder. A subset of women experience isolated postpartum psychosis that does not progress to mood or psychotic episodes outside the postpartum time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-psychosis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The clinical picture of postpartum psychosis includes rapid onset of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations and delusions, bizarre behavior, confusion, and disorganization that may appear to be delirium. Postpartum psychosis constitutes a medical emergency and generally requires rapid intervention and hospitalization, as well as a comprehensive medical evaluation and psychiatric management.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of postpartum psychosis are reviewed here.

Persistent severe insomnia (not related to caring for the newborn) is often the first indication of an incipient postpartum psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-psychosis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>In some cases, the patient may appear to be delirious with disorientation to person, place, or time, without evidence of other causes of delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-psychosis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,24</a>]. The patient's mental status may fluctuate between periods of confusion or perplexity and intermittent clearing. In contrast, psychosis that is not associated with childbirth typically presents without disorientation to person, place, or time.</p><p>Delusions in postpartum psychosis tend to be related to the patient's mood state (eg, in the depressed or mixed state, the woman may believe that the baby is evil or that people are poisoning her). In a study of 108 consecutive women hospitalized with postpartum psychosis, 53 percent had delusions about their baby [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-psychosis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, delusions typical of schizophrenia are often more bizarre (eg, the Central Intelligence Agency implanted a transmitter in the woman's teeth). Command auditory hallucinations may be present, instructing the mother to harm the baby or herself.
