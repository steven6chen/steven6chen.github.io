A pacemaker can treat an abnormal heart rate. &quot;Heart rate&quot; is the term doctors use to describe how fast a person's heart is beating.</p><p>Normally, each person has a built-in electrical system in the heart that controls his or her heart rate. A person's heart needs to beat at a normal rate in order to pump blood to all parts of the body. Sometimes, a person's built-in electrical system does not work the right way. This can cause a person's heart to beat too slowly or too fast.</p><p>Different conditions, such as certain heart problems, can cause a person's heart rate to be abnormal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9034813\"><span class=\"h1\">How does a pacemaker work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pacemaker sends electrical signals to the heart. These signals cause the heart to beat at a normal rate. Most of the time, pacemakers are used to treat a heart rate that is too slow. But pacemakers can also prevent or control a heart rate that is too fast.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9034828\"><span class=\"h1\">Who might need a pacemaker?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person might need a pacemaker if he or she has an abnormal heart rate and has symptoms. These symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or light-headed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling your heart pounding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling confused or more tired than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9034843\"><span class=\"h1\">What does a pacemaker look like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pacemakers have 2 parts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;pulse generator&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F104624\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104624 \">picture 1</a>) &ndash; This is a thin metal case with a battery and tiny computer in it. The pulse generator creates and sends electrical signals. A doctor can pre-set the computer to tell the pulse generator when to send electrical signals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wires, also called &quot;leads&quot; &ndash; The wires connect the pulse generator to the heart. Electrical signals can travel from the pulse generator through the wires to the heart. Information about how the heart is working can also travel from the heart back to the pulse generator. There is one available pacemaker that works without any wires.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9034858\"><span class=\"h1\">Do all pacemakers work the same way?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Pacemakers can work in different ways. A pacemaker can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Send electrical signals all of the time or some of the time &ndash; Some pacemakers send electrical signals at a steady rate all of the time. Others send electrical signals only when a person's heart rate is too slow or too fast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Send electrical signals to one or more parts of the heart</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9034873\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a &quot;temporary pacemaker&quot;?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A temporary pacemaker is a pacemaker that is used for a short time, usually when a person is in the hospital. The pulse generator of a temporary pacemaker is not put inside the body. People might have a temporary pacemaker if they have a condition that will get better soon. They might also have a temporary pacemaker as a short-term treatment until they get a pacemaker put in their body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9034888\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after I get a pacemaker?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you get a pacemaker, you will need to follow up with your doctor on a regular basis. He or she might do a test called an &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; (ECG). An ECG measures the electrical activity in the heart. Your doctor will also check to make sure that your pacemaker is working the right way.</p><p>Some people might need to have the pulse generator part of their pacemaker replaced in the future. This is because the battery in the pulse generator usually lasts 5 to 8 years. Wires do not usually need to be replaced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9034903\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do if I have a pacemaker?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a pacemaker, you will need to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid certain electric or magnetic sources or equipment &ndash; Your doctor will tell you which electric or magnetic sources or equipment you can be near, and which ones you should avoid. For example, people with a pacemaker can be near televisions and radios. But some people with a pacemaker should not walk through a metal detector at the airport. (People who cannot walk through a metal detector can have a security search by hand instead.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let all of your doctors and nurses know that you have a pacemaker &ndash; Some procedures and tests are safe for people with a pacemaker, but others are not. For example, most people with a pacemaker should not have a type of imaging test called an MRI scan. Many people with a pacemaker carry an emergency medical card that tells people they have a pacemaker.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9034918\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-flutter-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial flutter (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sick sinus syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradycardia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bradycardia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pacemakers (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
