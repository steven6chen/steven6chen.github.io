Abnormal uterine bleeding, the most common symptom associated with fibroids, is most frequent in women with tumors that abut the endometrium (lining of the uterine cavity), including submucosal and some intramural fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. This is likely due to distortion of the uterine cavity and an increase in the bleeding surface of the endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Submucosal leiomyomas, which derive from myometrial cells just below the endometrium, account for approximately 15 to 20 percent of fibroids.</p><p>Historically, hysterotomy or hysterectomy was performed to remove submucosal leiomyomas. This has been largely replaced by hysteroscopic myomectomy, a minimally invasive surgical procedure that effectively and safely removes these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>].</p><p>Hysteroscopic myomectomy is reviewed here.

It is a minimally invasive procedure that is the procedure of choice for appropriate candidates.

However, since this is a minimally invasive procedure, medical comorbidities are rarely a contraindication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-principles-of-medical-consultation-and-perioperative-medicine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the principles of medical consultation and perioperative medicine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Leiomyoma characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who are appropriate candidates for hysteroscopic myomectomy must conform to appropriate indications and contraindications, but also must have fibroid characteristics that are amenable to this technique. Hysteroscopic myomectomy removes fibroids that have an intracavitary component (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53241 \">figure 1</a>). Removal of fibroids that penetrate into the myometrium, are large, or are sessile takes longer, has the potential for increased perioperative complications, and may result in incomplete fibroid resection. In addition, for women with additional fibroids that are intramural or subserosal or who have other uterine pathology (eg, adenomyosis), hysteroscopic myomectomy may not provide symptomatic relief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1343078228\"><span class=\"h3\">Classification systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used classification system for the extent of myometrial involvement of a fibroid was described by the European Society of Hysteroscopy (ESH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59668\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59668 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 0 &ndash; completely within the endometrial cavity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I &ndash; extend less than 50 percent into the myometrium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II &ndash; extend 50 percent or more within the myometrium</p><p/><p>Observational studies support the ability of the ESH system to predict complete fibroid resection; reported rates of complete resection rates by type were: type 0 (96 to 97 percent), type I (86 to 90 percent), and type II (61 to 83 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In addition, depth of myometrial penetration appears to correlate with the volume of distension fluid absorbed. This was illustrated in a series of 339 hysteroscopic myomectomies that reported that the volume of fluid absorbed during the procedure increased significantly with the degree of myometrial penetration (type 0: 450 mL, type I: 957 mL, and type II: 1682 mL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>However, the ESH system considers only the degree of penetration of the submucous myoma in the myometrium. Another classification system was proposed in 2005, which uses transvaginal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree of penetration in the myometrium, as well as other fibroid characteristics: size, distance of the base along the uterine wall, and portion of the cavity in which the fibroid is located [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Further studies are needed to validate this classification system.</p><p>Another classification system, the STEP-W submucosal fibroid classification system takes into account additional features of the fibroid utilizing transvaginal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging to assess five myoma characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105588\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105588 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. 2-D and 3-D saline infusion sonography is widely accepted to improve the visualization of the endometrium and myometrial interface. The STEP-W classification considers size, topography, extension of the fibroid base, depth of fibroid penetration, and the lateral wall involvement. Each factor is assigned a point value. A low score of 0 to 4 (low complexity) is associated with safety and successful removal of the fibroid in one hysteroscopic setting. A score of 5 or 6 is considered high complexity, and may require a two-stage hysteroscopic procedure. A score of 7 to 9 is considered not amenable to treatment hysteroscopically.</p><p>The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics also has a classification system for uterine leiomyomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F91085\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91085 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Myometrial penetration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with symptomatic fibroids, we suggest hysteroscopic myomectomy <strong>only</strong> for fibroids that are completely within the endometrial cavity or extend less than 50 percent into the myometrium. Removal of fibroids with deeper myometrial involvement requires advanced hysteroscopic skills or myomectomy using laparotomy or laparoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Leiomyoma size and number</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysteroscopic resection of large fibroids may involve increased perioperative complications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> require more than one procedure for symptomatic relief. The definition of large is not well established. Only one prospective study of 122 women examined the effect of fibroid size; the risk of subsequent fibroid-related surgery within four years was significantly lower in women with fibroids that were &le;3 cm versus 4 cm or more (10 versus 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Increasing size of fibroid requires exquisite hysteroscopic skill, complete understanding of fluid management, ability to quickly remove myoma chip fragments that might preclude surgical visualization, and techniques to decrease risk of uterine perforation when chip fragments are removed.</p><p>Clinician skills ultimately determine the maximal size or number of fibroids that can be removed. For leiomyomas that are multiple or are &gt;3 cm or deep in myometrium, it is prudent to include in the informed consent the possibility of a two-stage procedure (ie, two hysteroscopy procedures).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Presence of other leiomyomas or uterine pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women have intracavitary fibroids in combination with fibroids in other locations (eg, intramural, subserosal). As the volume of additional fibroids increases, the surgeon must decide whether isolated removal of the intracavitary fibroid(s) will provide adequate treatment or if a laparoscopic or abdominal approach to myomectomy or a hysterectomy is preferable. Other factors that influence the choice of surgical approach include desire for future fertility and presence of other pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The greater the volume of additional fibroids, the greater the likelihood that symptomatic relief will be provided only by a laparoscopic or abdominal approach to myomectomy and the less likely that isolated removal of intracavitary fibroids will provide symptomatic relief.</p><p>Patients with fibroids that are both intracavitary and in other locations who have bulk symptoms (abdominal pain, pressure, or distension; urinary urgency, frequency, or retention; or constipation) are not likely to benefit from hysteroscopic resection alone.</p><p>On the other hand, women without bulk symptoms and normal or slightly enlarged uterine size who have heavy uterine bleeding or conditions that appear to derive specifically from the presence of an intracavitary lesion, such as recurrent pregnancy loss or fibroid-associated leukorrhea, may benefit from the isolated removal of an intracavitary myoma, even if other leiomyomas are present.</p><p>Women with abnormal uterine bleeding or dysmenorrhea may have both adenomyosis and intracavitary fibroids. These patients are also likely to have persistent symptoms after hysteroscopic myomectomy. These women may require a medical therapy alone or in combination with hysteroscopic myomectomy, or a hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-adenomyosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine adenomyosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women with symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding or dysmenorrhea who have an intracavitary fibroid in combination with diffuse adenomyosis, a hysteroscopic myomectomy is unlikely to provide complete symptomatic relief. However, patients with focal adenomyosis and normal uterine size should be offered hysteroscopic myomectomy; such patients should be counseled preoperatively regarding the limited evidence regarding outcome of this procedure among women with these two uterine pathologies.</p><p>The differential diagnosis for a uterine mass also includes adenomyoma, smooth muscle tumor of uncertain malignant potential, leiomyosarcoma, or endometrial stromal tumor.

(See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H43\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence of leiomyomas or bleeding symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Women with intracavitary myomas that are multiple, broad-based, large (&gt;3 cm), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> penetrate into the myometrium should be advised that a second procedure may be necessary to fully remove all myomas (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Two-step procedures'</a> below). This discussion should be documented on the surgical consent form and in the medical record.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough history is important to determine whether fibroid-related symptoms are present (eg, heavy uterine bleeding, bulk symptoms) and whether these symptoms affect the patient's quality of life.

Knowledge of these fibroid characteristics prior to surgery helps to select appropriate patients as well as to prepare for or prevent blood loss (eg, measurement of preoperative hematocrit, preoperative endometrial preparation) and minimize fluid deficit and to ensure that the appropriate instruments and surgical expertise are available. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Leiomyoma characteristics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative medications'</a> below.)</p><p>We suggest saline infusion sonography, where available, since it is a single modality that can evaluate the relationship of a leiomyoma to both the endometrial cavity and the myometrium. An alternative is to use a combination of office-based diagnostic hysteroscopy and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). Hysteroscopy can define the extent to which a fibroid protrudes into the uterine cavity, and TVUS can define the depth of myometrial penetration. It is useful for the surgeon to view the TVUS images to establish whether a hysteroscopic approach is feasible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) defines leiomyoma position well, but is prohibitively expensive to use routinely for this indication. Hysterosalpingography and computed tomography have limited use in delineating fibroid location. The use of pelvic imaging for diagnosis of leiomyomas is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with enlarged uterine size (ie, 14 to 16 weeks or larger on pelvic examination), SIS may be impractical. Maintenance of uterine distension is difficult and limits the ability to interpret images of the endometrium and myometrium. MRI may be more useful to evaluate women for a type 0, I, or II leiomyoma as described in the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics and European Society of Hysteroscopy classification systems. Additionally, MRI is also used in the STEP-W classification system.</p><p>In addition, any woman with abnormal uterine bleeding at risk for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer should undergo evaluation of the endometrium prior to hysteroscopic myomectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58600 \">table 2</a>).

The blood loss during hysteroscopic myomectomy does not typically exceed 100 mL. However, if anemia is a concern, measure should be taken to treat this prior to surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to prevent bleeding during surgery.

While many surgeons use these agents, particularly for large fibroids (&gt;3 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], we prefer not to use GnRHa, since there are no high-quality data that they make complete resection possible for large fibroids, or reduce intraoperative blood loss or distention fluid absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/12,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17-20</a>].

Surgical innovations have improved visualization and decreased risk of fluid-related complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1343078737\"><span class=\"h2\">Distension fluid control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid is instilled to distend the uterus and allow visualization. General principles of fluid control and avoidance of excessive absorption are the same for hysteroscopic myomectomy as for other procedures. Risk factors for increased absorption of fluid includes operating time, depth of myometrial incision, and size of the lesion. Continuous fluid monitoring is necessary throughout the procedure to avoid complications (eg, hyponatremia, pulmonary, cardiac, or laryngeal edema) or the need to abort the procedure. Hypotonic solutions (ie, glycine) are used when a resectoscope with monopolar electrical wire loop technique is employed. Bipolar resectoscopes are used with isotonic fluids. Tissue extraction (morcellation) and vaporization devices are used with saline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopy: Managing fluid and gas distending media&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Automated fluid pump and monitoring systems are preferable to manual techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Use of a hysteroscope with a continuous flow operative sheath helps to clear blood from the uterine cavity and thus improves visualization. Some hysteroscopic tissue extraction and vaporization devices require use of a proprietary fluid monitoring system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Leiomyoma resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wire loop with a monopolar or bipolar resectoscope has traditionally been the technique used for hysteroscopic myomectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55853\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55853 \">picture 1</a>). Hysteroscopic morcellation and vaporization devices have also been introduced.</p><p>Most gynecologists are familiar with the wire loop technique and the equipment is cost-effective and widely available. If a monopolar device is used, a non-electrolytic solution is used (eg, 1.5 percent glycine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> 3 percent, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> is used). If a bipolar device is used, the fluid medium is isotonic saline or Ringer's lactate solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As an adjunct to this technique, hysteroscopic scissors can be used for small pedunculated fibroids or fragments that remain attached to the uterine wall and are not easily removed with the loop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopy: Managing fluid and gas distending media&quot;, section on 'Fluid media'</a>.)</p><p>The goals of newer techniques, such as morcellation or vaporization, is to make resection of fibroids technically easier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], produce fewer tissue fragments, require fewer insertions of the hysteroscope, and use saline as the distention medium. Fewer insertions of the hysteroscope is helpful for patients with marked cervical stenosis, a <span class=\"nowrap\">retroverted/retroflexed</span> uterus, or a small uterine cavity associated with menopause. Any of these factors may increase the risk of uterine perforation, particularly with repeat insertions of the hysteroscope. The use of saline avoids use of hypotonic solutions (ie, glycine), that may result in hyponatremia. In addition, because resection is performed mechanically or with limited bipolar radiofrequency (Symphion), there is minimal risk of damage to the endometrium. These devices are designed to enter only to a shallow depth and therefore are not likely to cause an incision that penetrates the full thickness of the uterine wall. As with any intrauterine instrument, it is possible for uterine perforation to occur if the entire device is pushed through the wall of the myometrium.</p><p>Visual dilation and curettage can be performed with the hysteroscopic morcellators. The hysteroscopic morcellator cutting aperture is aligned next to or abutting the endometrium. Under direct hysteroscopic visualization, the endometrium can be sampling with a to and fro maneuver with the hysteroscope, duplicating the same technique used with a curette.</p><p>However, the disposable morcellator or tissue retrieval system is more expensive than a wire loop and may require a propriety fluid management system, which also adds to the expense.</p><p>Comparative studies have reported that myomectomy duration was 8 to 26 minutes shorter with the intrauterine morcellator versus a resectoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Of note, some of these studies were performed in an office setting. In addition, a review of events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2005 to 2014 included 119 adverse events, including death (2 cases), bowel damage (12), hysterectomy (6), uterine perforation requiring no other treatment (29), and pelvic infection (4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The limitation of these data is that the total number of procedures performed during this time period is unknown.</p><p>The disadvantage for two of the current hysteroscopic morcellators is that they cannot cauterize bleeding vessels. Only one system, Symphion, utilizes a built-in spot coagulation to control bleeding to maintain continuous visualization. The hysteroscopic morcellator is also not designed to treat deeper myomas, and thus, is limited to use in women with hysteroscopic type 0 or type I leiomyomas. Since myomas that appear to be type 0 or I upon preoperative evaluation may &quot;sink&quot; deeper into the myometrium during surgery and may not be retrieved with a morcellating device, the optimal situation is for a surgeon to have access and surgical skills to utilize both the wire loop and morcellator if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of the wire loop or tissue extraction (morcellator) techniques yield tissue fragments (referred to as chips) that need to be removed.</p><p>Some operative sheaths aspirate pieces of tissue from the uterine cavity to remove debris or retrieve specimens for pathologic evaluation (eg, Chip E-Vac, hysteroscopic morcellator). This allows removal of large debris while maintaining clear visualization.</p><p>There are several options to remove tissue fragments with conventional resectoscopy. Options include grasping as many myoma fragments under direct visualization with the wire loop and removing tissue fragments, chip by chip. This is safe, but time-consuming. Other techniques include blind insertion of uterine polyp forceps or myoma graspers, suction curettage, or slow removal of the hysteroscope through the dilated cervix allowing the tissue fragments to tumble out. Overall these techniques require multiple insertions of the hysteroscope.</p><p>With hysteroscopic tissue retrieval or morcellation devices, tissue fragments are retrieved throughout the procedure with the device in place, and thus fewer insertions are required. This may result is a shorter operative duration and decreased risk of cervical trauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positioning, sterile preparation, and cervical dilation are performed in the standard fashion for hysteroscopy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;, section on 'Procedure'</a>). Close attention to the distension fluid deficit is critical to avoid complications of excessive fluid absorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopy: Managing fluid and gas distending media&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1406513\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysteroscopic myomectomy is performed under general or regional anesthesia or intravenous sedation. In addition, a paracervical block is sometimes performed to provide postoperative analgesia.

This technique works well for most intracavitary leiomyomas, those that protrude entirely or more than 50 percent of their mass into the uterine cavity (type 0, I, or II). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Myometrial penetration'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the resectoscope through the cervix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After distension with fluid, inspect the uterine cavity. Note the size and location of the fibroids and whether they are sessile or pedunculated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We set a monopolar resectoscope to a cutting current of 60 to 120 watts; fibroids that are calcified may require a current up to 120 watts. Bipolar technology uses the default setting for both cutting and hemostasis. The wire loop should easily pass through the tissue. If it does not, the power setting is increased to prevent tissue adherence to the wire loop.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Begin incising at the most cephalad surface of the myoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58947\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58947 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61871\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61871 \">picture 2</a>). For a pedunculated fibroid, the loop electrode can be used to cut directly through the base.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bring the resectoscope loop towards the surgeon using the spring mechanism of the loop alone or by moving the entire resectoscope towards the surgeon. To avoid injury, it is important to keep the loop in view at all times and activate the loop only when moving it towards the operator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat this motion until the fibroid has been resected to the level of the surrounding endometrium.</p><p/><p>Tissue obtained should be sent for pathologic evaluation. The surgically disrupted area will become covered with newly proliferated endometrium postoperatively.</p><p>During hysteroscopic wire loop resection, the edges of the fibroid tend to fall inward as the middle is resected, thus increasing the panoramic view. It is more efficient to continue resection until fibroid fragments, or &quot;chips,&quot; preclude further visualization. At that point, carefully remove the chips (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53091\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53091 \">picture 3</a>). This can be accomplished using the inactivated wire loop or blindly with a <span class=\"nowrap\">polyp/myoma</span> forceps or suction curette; another option is to remove the inner sheath of the resectoscope to facilitate the egress of tissue chips. As noted in a preceding section, some surgical systems evacuate chips (Chip E-Vac, hysteroscopic morcellator). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Tissue removal'</a> above.)</p><p>Occasionally, as the fibroid is cut, the previously round myoma becomes more irregularly shaped, and can be grasped bluntly and avulsed with <span class=\"nowrap\">polyp/myoma</span> forceps. Care must be taken to avoid uterine perforation. If this is done, hysteroscopic reinspection is imperative to ensure complete resection and hemostasis. Excessive traction blindly with the avulsing technique should be avoided to decrease the risk of uterine eversion, perforation, or injury to surrounding intraabdominal viscera.</p><p>In the event of heavy perioperative bleeding, the endometrium should be reinspected with the hysteroscope. Small areas of bleeding can be desiccated with the resectoscope using coagulating current. When using a monopolar system, set the coagulating current at 60 to 80 watts. With bipolar technology, the coagulating current is set to the default setting. Additional measures are described below. (See <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Excessive bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1584435896\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue extraction device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hysteroscopic tissue extraction device, also referred to as a morcellator (eg, Intra Uterine Morcellator, Truclear, and Myosure), utilizes a rotary blade for resection and suction tubing to remove tissue fragments. The Symphion system utilizes a bladeless resection technology with radiofrequency energy and has a proprietary self-contained recirculating fluid management fluid and internal uterine pressure monitoring system.</p><p>There are no data or guidelines regarding the risk of dissemination of potentially malignant tissue with hysteroscopic tissue extraction devices, as with laparoscopic morcellation of uterine leiomyomas. The risk of this is likely lower, since the uterus is mostly contained, although tissue and fluid may extrude from the fallopian tubes. This has been raised as a concern when hysteroscopy is used in the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding. In addition, the traditional wire loop technique also disrupts the tissue into small fragments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;, section on 'Risk of tumor dissemination'</a>.)</p><p>This section will describe the techniques utilized for use of hysteroscopic tissue extraction devices. This technique can be used for most type 0 (completely within the endometrial cavity) and some type I leiomyomas (extend less than 50 percent into the myometrium), endometrial polyps, or retained products of conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The procedure is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saline is used as the distention medium. A fluid monitoring pump is utilized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hysteroscope is inserted through the cervix into the uterine cavity under direct visualization. The uterine cavity is examined and confirms that a hysteroscopically removable lesion is present. Once this is confirmed, the disposable morcellator device can be opened and inserted through the working channel of the hysteroscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hysteroscopic aperture is aligned so that the aperture touches the surface of the lesion. Activate the foot pedal. It is important to keep the morcellator aperture closely approximated to the lesion to facilitate complete removal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hysteroscope's working channel is at the distal tip equipped with a tissue removal device with a distal window that captures intracavitary pathology and resects it through a reciprocating or rotating cutting edge with simultaneous aspiration retrieval.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittently decompress the uterine cavity by lowering the intrauterine pressure on the fluid monitoring system. This will decrease the likelihood of a &quot;negative hysteroscopic view,&quot; make it easier to remove fundal lesions and help enucleate type 0 leiomyomas.</p><p/><p>There are several available hysteroscopic morcellator devices; the manufacturer instructions should be followed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1343078050\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaporization technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaporization electrodes (eg, VaporTrode, Force FX, and Gyne-Pro<sup> </sup>Perforated roller electrode) can be used with a monopolar or bipolar hysteroscope, operate at a higher power density (120 to 220 watts versus 60 to 120 watts with a monopolar resectoscope), and vaporize the tissue. This eliminates accumulation of tissue fragments that can occlude the view; however, it also prohibits evaluation of the tissue for pathology. Clinically, these devices are useful to desiccate the fibroid, making it smaller, and then exchange the vaporization electrode for a wire loop to complete the procedure. In so doing, histologic retrieval is possible. In addition, vaporization may lead to the formation of bubbles in the distension fluid, thereby interfering with visualization.</p><p>The vaporization technique should be avoided at the cornua and isthmus, since these anatomic regions are thinner and at increased risk of perforation, bowel burns, and intraperitoneal injuries. With the higher power settings used, two dispersive pads should be placed to ground the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques for challenging resections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a leiomyoma is large (&gt;3 cm), sessile, or penetrates into the myometrium, advanced hysteroscopy skills are necessary to differentiate the fibroid from the myometrium and apply techniques to achieve complete fibroid resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Excessive resection of the myometrium will increase blood loss, fluid absorption, and myometrial scar tissue, and potentially result in uterine perforation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589538829\"><span class=\"h3\">Difficult-to-reach myomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is very helpful to have the patient's buttocks at the end of the operating table. Additionally, the cervix should be grasped tightly with a single-toothed tenaculum. An extra-long operative hysteroscope may be utilized if available. Ergonomics is important during surgery and each surgeon should determine whether the sitting position or standing position facilitates difficult-to-reach fibroids. Use of Trendelenburg position should <strong>never</strong> be utilized during hysteroscopy in order to decrease the risk of air embolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589538835\"><span class=\"h3\">Obese patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obese women may require use of a larger open-sided speculum, an extra-long heavy weighted speculum, or an extra-long operative hysteroscope in order to traverse a long vagina to gain access to the uterine cavity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Distinguishing myoma versus myometrium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To distinguish the border between the leiomyoma and surrounding myometrium, a surgeon should recognize differences in texture and appearance between the two types of tissue. The fibroid is firm, with a whorled appearance, while the myometrium is soft and the muscular fascicles are apparent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Enucleating a myoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Techniques for enucleating the fibroid from its pseudocapsule include placing the wire loop electrode strategically behind the myoma to elevate and separate the myoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66817 \">picture 4</a>). Initially, the inactive electrode is used to elevate the leiomyoma out of the pseudocapsule, followed by using the activated electrode to incise the myoma and facilitate its retrieval. Another technique is to use the inactive loop to partially enucleate the fibroid with mechanical dissection and then deflate the uterine cavity to cause further protrusion of the myoma (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Use of uterine contractions'</a> below). The wire loop technique, described in a preceding section, is then resumed to achieve complete resection. (See <a href=\"#H1343078925\" class=\"local\">'Wire loop technique'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of uterine contractions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deflation of the uterine cavity refers to removing the operative hysteroscope and waiting for several minutes to permit myometrial contractions to cause extrusion of the myoma. When the hysteroscope is replaced, the surgeon will commonly see more of the myoma extruding into the cavity. Facilitation of uterine contractions with administration of a prostaglandin has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]; a series of 13 patients reported successful use of carboprost (125 mcg in 5 mL of saline, injected intracervically) for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The only study to evaluate this approach was a retrospective cohort study of 126 patients that reported that complete fibroid resection was more likely with sonographic versus laparoscopic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Two-step procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A two-step procedure is occasionally necessary for fibroids that are multiple, large, broad-based, or penetrate deeply within the myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The most common reason for this is that the initial procedure was halted when the maximal fluid absorption was reached. Such patients should be seen for a follow-up visit two to four months after the initial procedure to assess whether fibroid-related symptoms persist. If so, evaluation of the uterine cavity is repeated: the size, number, and location of the leiomyoma(s). With this information, the surgeon can offer appropriate management, whether hysteroscopic myomectomy or another treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">CONCOMITANT PROCEDURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometrial polypectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Removal of a coexisting endometrial polyp is standard practice at the time of hysteroscopic myomectomy.

When there is excessive bleeding encountered, it is often associated with preoperative factors, such as patients who present with heavy bleeding or performing the procedure at the time of menstruation. The most common reason for excessive bleeding is uterine perforation when the uterus is sounded and is seen immediately at the beginning of the procedure. Perforation may also occur during resection. Heavy bleeding may also occur if the resection involves deep myometrial blood vessels. Cervical laceration from the cervical tenaculum can also lead to increased bleeding. If this occurs, placement of a figure-of-eight suture may be all that is required. Transfusion is rarely indicated, and the risk is generally related to the degree of preoperative anemia encountered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1406016\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention or management of bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heavy intraoperative bleeding can be prevented or managed with several approaches.</p><p>For prevention, a preoperative intracervical injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> may be used. In some cases, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are used preoperatively to reduce leiomyoma size, thus reducing bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H1343078433\" class=\"local\">'Agents to decrease bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p>For management intraoperatively, measures to assess and control bleeding include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess hemodynamic status &ndash; The hemodynamic status at the time of onset of bleeding should be assessed and checked again at regular intervals throughout the perioperative period. The volume of blood loss that results in hemodynamic changes depends upon the patient's age and health status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate for uterine perforation &ndash; Signs of a uterine perforation include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapid increase in the fluid deficit, especially when prior absorption was minimal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Visualization of bowel loops or bowel contents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemodynamic changes (this may occur due to visceral or vascular injury)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To assess for perforation, the hysteroscope should be inserted and the intrauterine pressure increased briefly to 100 to 125 mmHg to visualize the endometrial cavity and inspect for a perforation. There should be a high suspicion of perforation if the uterine cavity cannot be adequately distended and visualization is poor, particularly if distension and visualization were achieved easily prior to the onset of bleeding. Evaluation and management of uterine perforation is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine perforation during gynecologic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate for cervical laceration &ndash; To evaluate for a cervical laceration, remove the hysteroscope and visualize the cervix. A single-tooth tenaculum is placed on the anterior lip of the cervix as the mechanical dilation of the cervix at the beginning of the procedure. If the tenaculum pulled off <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if the tenaculum had to be replaced multiple times, it is important to look for cervical laceration. Cervical laceration is an uncommon complication; in our experience, this occurs in approximately 1 percent of procedures. Factors that are associated with an increased risk of cervical laceration include difficult cervical dilation (eg, due to cervical stenosis), a cervix that is flush with the vaginal vault, a small loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was required due to marked cervical stenosis (a mini-shallow LEEP was performed at the time of hysteroscopy to resect the stenotic external os), or postmenopausal or postpartum status. If a cervical laceration is noted, it is repaired with a figure-of-eight or running and locked suture. A very curved suture (eg, a UR-6 needle) is ideal for cervical repairs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply intrauterine pressure &ndash; Intrauterine pressure may be applied using a bladder (Foley) catheter balloon place inside the uterine cavity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Care should be taken to evaluate the uterine size and compliance to estimate the amount of fluid that should be instilled into the balloon. Excessive inflation may result in postoperative pain or uterine rupture. For this reason, the Bakri balloon should <strong>not</strong> be used for intrauterine tamponade in cases of heavy bleeding that occurs during hysteroscopic surgery. The Bakri balloon is too large and may cause uterine rupture if inflated too much; it is intended only for obstetric hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The uterine cavity normally sounds to 8 cm and holds approximately 8 mL of fluid. Preoperative bimanual examination, hysteroscopic visualization of the uterine cavity, and gentle sounding of the cavity will aid in determining the uterine size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Overall uterine size can be evaluated with bimanual examination, but in some cases the overall size may not correspond to the size of the cavity. There are several factors to consider: Does the patient have a 10 cm exophytic pedunculated fibroid that is attached to a normal size uterus? If so, the uterine cavity will be normal size, yet on bimanual examination the uterine size is large. Does she have multiple intramural fibroids which make the uterus enlarged? Does she have a 10 cm intracavitary fibroid that grossly enlarges the uterus? Hysteroscopic visualization of the endometrium is useful in determining the volume of the cavity and presence of myomas within the cavity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The ability to instill fluid for hysteroscopy gives a sense of the uterine distensibility. A surgeon may note that higher intrauterine pressure is required to maintain uterine distention when the uterus has multiple uterine fibroids. Factors that decrease compliance, in our experience, include gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, prior endometrial ablation, multiple intramural fibroids greater than 4 cm, and adenomyosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The bladder catheter is inserted through the cervix and into the uterine cavity. We use a size 16 French catheter with a 3 to 30 mL balloon. Inflate the balloon with sterile water until mild resistance is encountered. There is a subtle tactile feeling when it becomes more difficult to distend the balloon; recognizing this feeling is achieved with experience with intrauterine procedures. The amount of fluid instilled into the balloon should be recorded in the operative note. If the patient complains of lower pelvic pain after she emerges from anesthesia, the balloon should be deflated until tolerated by the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After inflation, the catheter bag should be monitored for volume of blood drainage. In our practice, we generally leave the intrauterine catheter in place four to eight hours; however, surgeons must individualize the care of each patient. To remove the catheter, it should be deflated over several hours and blood loss monitored. The balloon can be reinflated if increased bleeding occurs. With the balloon removed, if bleeding is minimal, the patient can be discharged from the surgical unit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In terms of efficacy, in one series of 216 resectoscope procedures, four women (1.9 percent) developed postoperative uterine bleeding and were successfully treated with this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vasopressin</a> &ndash; If the patient continues to bleed briskly with the intrauterine balloon in place, we administer an intracervical injection of vasopressin (eg, 20 units in 100 mL of normal saline, injected into the cervical stroma in 5 mL aliquots at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions around the ectocervix). This dose can be repeated every 30 to 45 minutes, if bleeding increases. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Vasopressin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate for anemia and coagulopathy &ndash; If the estimated blood loss is &ge;500 mL <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if bleeding persists after injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>, the patient should be evaluated for anemia and coagulopathy, and treated if appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Medical stabilization'</a>.)</p><p/><p>If the patient is hemodynamically unstable or massive bleeding occurs, the hysteroscopic procedure should be terminated and a laparoscopy or laparotomy may be required for further evaluation and management. This may include evaluation for uterine perforation with vascular or visceral injury or surgical approaches to controlling bleeding.

In studies in which women had a second-look hysteroscopy after the initial hysteroscopic myomectomy report, the rates of this complication varied widely, from 0 to 46 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/17,43,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,43,46</a>]. The rate appears to be higher if more than one fibroid is resected (in one study, 31 percent for single versus 46 percent for multiple fibroids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

However, many studies and surgeons report high patient satisfaction, resolution of abnormal uterine bleeding, and a low rate of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-myomectomy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete myoma resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete resection of a fibroid depends upon the extent of myometrial penetration, as noted in a preceding section (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Leiomyoma characteristics'</a> above).

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common indications for hysteroscopic myomectomy are abnormal uterine bleeding, recurrent pregnancy loss, and infertility. Hysteroscopic myomectomy is contraindicated in women in whom hysteroscopic surgery is contraindicated (eg, active pelvic infection, intrauterine pregnancy). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women planning hysteroscopic myomectomy, we suggest preoperative evaluation of the uterus with saline infusion sonography (SIS). Use of both diagnostic hysteroscopy and transvaginal sonography is a reasonable option where SIS is not available. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of the uterus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following recommendations are for women with fibroid-associated symptoms who desire surgical treatment:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest not performing hysteroscopic myomectomy in women with intracavitary fibroids that extend 50 percent or more into the myometrium (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Removal of fibroids with deep myometrial involvement requires advanced hysteroscopic skills or myomectomy using laparotomy or laparoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Myometrial penetration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with intracavitary fibroids in combination with three or more intramural or subserosal fibroids with a total volume of &gt;3 cm who have fibroid-associated bulk symptoms (abdominal or pelvic pressure or pain, urinary symptoms, constipation), we suggest myomectomy using laparotomy or laparoscopy rather than hysteroscopy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Isolated removal of intracavitary fibroids is reasonable in some women, such as those with menstrual aberrations only, recurrent miscarriage, or fibroid-associated leukorrhea. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Presence of other leiomyomas or uterine pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest against use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists prior to hysteroscopic myomectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Use of these agents is reasonable in women with large fibroids (&gt;3 cm) who are willing to tolerate the vasomotor symptoms and by surgeons who find an operative benefit. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'GnRH agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential complications of hysteroscopic myomectomy include uterine perforation, excessive absorption of distension fluid with resultant hyponatremia or volume overload, excessive perioperative bleeding, intrauterine adhesions, and infection.
