The causes are myriad, and misdiagnosis and mismanagement are common.</p><p>This topic review will provide a brief overview of craniofacial pain. Primary headache syndromes are discussed elsewhere.

Neuropathic pain can be caused by a lesion of the central or peripheral somatosensory nervous system.</p><p>Head and neck pain is mediated by sensory fibers carried by the following nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trigeminal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nervus intermedius</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glossopharyngeal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vagus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper cervical spinal cord roots</p><p/><p>Neuralgic pain can have a paroxysmal quality, which is typically maximal at onset and is often described as lancinating, electrical shock-like, or jabbing. There may be a single sharp pain or repetitive pains in succession. The pain can last a fraction of a second or endure for several seconds. There may be a refractory period after the severe pain during which pain will not occur. Some neuralgic conditions have trigger zones (areas that when stimulated provoke an attack) or other triggers.</p><p>Careful history often reveals nonparoxysmal types of pain, such as continuous aching, burning, or throbbing pain. Inquiries must be made about all the sensations that occur, as some patients mention only the severe exacerbations. The response to treatment may provide a clue to diagnosis but can also prove misleading; &quot;diagnostic blocks&quot; in the setting of facial pain do not necessarily define the site from which the pain arises because of the overlap of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X, which converge on the spinal trigeminal nucleus and the tractus solitarius.</p><p>The mechanisms of neuropathic pain are complex. A nerve injury can induce peripheral and central changes that contribute to persistent pain and abnormal sensation. Through different mechanisms (inflammation, nociceptor activation, tissue injury), primary afferent fibers and central structures become sensitized. These processes are terminated under normal circumstances as tissues heal and inflammation declines. However, they can persist if primary afferent function is modified by disease, even in the absence of inflammation. While permanent loss or injury of primary afferent fibers (deafferentation) results in peripheral neuropathic pain, direct damage to central nervous system structures results in central pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93882323\"><span class=\"h2\">Trigeminal neuralgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trigeminal neuralgia is one of the most well-defined and common causes of facial pain. The pain of trigeminal neuralgia tends to occur in paroxysms and is maximal at or near onset. The pain has been described as electric shock-like or stabbing. Trigeminal neuralgia is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigeminal-neuralgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigeminal neuralgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1652448\"><span class=\"h2\">Painful trigeminal neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Painful trigeminal neuropathy (as opposed to classic trigeminal neuralgia) is defined by head <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> facial pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve caused by another disorder and indicative of neural damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Potential causes include acute herpes zoster, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), trauma (see <a href=\"#H93882621\" class=\"local\">'Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy (anesthesia dolorosa)'</a> below), trigeminal trophic syndrome, multiple sclerosis plaque, and space-occupying lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314304663\"><span class=\"h3\">Postherpetic neuralgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is variably defined as pain that persists anywhere from one to six months after the rash of acute herpes zoster has healed. PHN most often represents a continuum of pain that never resolved following an acute episode of herpes zoster. However, in rare cases, PHN can occur months to years after resolution of the initial event. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of PHN are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postherpetic-neuralgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postherpetic neuralgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93882621\"><span class=\"h3\">Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy (anesthesia dolorosa)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy, also known as anesthesia dolorosa, is characterized by unilateral facial or oral pain that occurs after traumatic injury of the trigeminal nerve, accompanied by additional symptoms or signs of trigeminal nerve dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This condition is a perfect example of how difficult central pain can be to describe since the patient has sensory loss, but at the same time, can feel pain. In anesthesia dolorosa, pain is superimposed in an area of the face that either lacks or has impaired sensation.</p><p>Diagnostic criteria for painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3), require all of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral facial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of an identifiable traumatic event to the trigeminal nerve, with clinically evident positive (hyperalgesia, allodynia) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> negative (hypoesthesia, hypoalgesia) signs of trigeminal nerve dysfunction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of causation demonstrated by both of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain is located in the distribution of the same trigeminal nerve</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain has developed within three to six months of the traumatic event</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis</p><p/><p>The causative traumatic event may be mechanical, chemical, thermal, or radiation-induced. Although sometimes related to surgical trauma, painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy most frequently occurs as a complication of rhizotomy or thermocoagulation done to treat trigeminal neuralgia. In case series of patients treated for trigeminal neuralgia, painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy has developed after glycerol rhizotomy in 0 to 1.6 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>], after radiofrequency rhizotomy in 0.8 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], and following percutaneous controlled thermocoagulation in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy can be more intolerable than the pain from trigeminal neuralgia itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This risk warrants careful decision making when considering surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigeminal-neuralgia#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigeminal neuralgia&quot;, section on 'Surgical therapy'</a>.)</p><p>For treatment of non-neuralgic painful post-traumatic trigeminal neuropathy, we suggest tricyclic antidepressants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>) as initial pharmacologic therapy. When tricyclic medications are contraindicated or poorly tolerated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> are preferred alternative choices. There is a case report of improvement in anesthesia dolorosa using gabapentin 1200 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For superimposed neuralgiform pain, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> is often used in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354058645\"><span class=\"h3\">Trigeminal trophic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The trigeminal trophic syndrome is characterized by facial skin ulceration and dysesthesia related to damage in the trigeminal nerve pathway affecting either peripheral components such as the trigeminal nerve (including the trigeminal ganglion and sensory root) or its central sensory nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. The most frequent causes are therapeutic trigeminal nerve ablation and ischemic medullary or pontine stroke; others include craniofacial surgery, trauma, and herpes zoster infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Higher trigeminal pathway injuries affecting the trigemino-thalamic or thalamo-cortical tracts have not been reported to cause trigeminal trophic syndrome.</p><p>The most common symptoms of trigeminal trophic syndrome are bothersome dysesthesia, including itching, tickling, crawling, burning, as well as ocular foreign body and nasal airflow obstruction sensations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. Approximately one-half of affected individuals report facial pain. Examination reveals facial hypoesthesia or anesthesia. Skin ulceration tends to occur in the distribution of the infraorbital nerve, although it can occur in other trigeminal distributions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The exact mechanisms for ulcer development have not been determined; self manipulation with rubbing and scratching of the dysesthetic regions appears to be a contributing factor and can lead to erosion of the nasal ala and corneal lesions.</p><p>There is no good treatment for trigeminal trophic syndrome, though <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> are often employed in efforts to control neuropathic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,19</a>]. Measures to protect the injured area and promote healing may be beneficial; these include protective facial prosthetics and dressings, finger nail trimming, use of nocturnal scratch mittens, and behavioral modification. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93882329\"><span class=\"h2\">Cluster-tic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cluster-tic syndrome is a combination of cluster headache with coexistent trigeminal neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/1,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20-22</a>]. It is characterized by three types of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One component resembles the pain of trigeminal neuralgia and is paroxysmal, short lasting, and severe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second component is more like a cluster headache, although of variable length, with autonomic phenomena (lacrimation, tearing). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third type of pain is a mixture of the first two and may be provoked by trigger points or moving the neck.</p><p/><p>Cluster-tic syndrome usually affects patients between 20 and 70 years of age. It may exist in chronic or episodic (remissions and recurrences) forms.</p><p>Patients with cluster-tic syndrome require treatment directed at both cluster headache and trigeminal neuralgia in order to achieve remission of headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/1,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23</a>]. Medical therapy usually consists of a combination of drugs used to treat trigeminal neuralgia and cluster headache and is often unsuccessful. It is reported that if surgery (microvascular decompression or trigeminal rhizotomy) relieves the neuralgia, the cluster-like pain may be lessened and become more responsive to medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Glossopharyngeal neuralgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is defined as paroxysmal pain in areas innervated by cranial nerves IX and X [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>]. There are numerous analogies to trigeminal neuralgia, with which it occasionally coexists, although glossopharyngeal neuralgia is much less common.</p><p>Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysmal, severe, stabbing pain involving the ear, tonsillar fossa, base of the tongue, or beneath the angle of the jaw [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, the pain can occur in the distributions of the auricular and pharyngeal branches of the vagus nerve as well as of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Bilateral involvement has been reported in 12 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Typical triggers include chewing, swallowing, coughing, speaking, yawning, certain tastes, or touching the neck or external auditory canal (rarely the pre- or postauricular areas). The pain typically radiates upward from the oropharynx toward the ear. The duration of the severe paroxysms is seconds to minutes, but there may also be a low grade, constant dull background pain. Several dozen attacks can occur per day, sometimes awakening the patient from sleep. Some episodes may also be associated with strenuous coughing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hoarseness.</p><p>Like trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia can occur in a pattern of episodes lasting weeks to months, alternating with longer periods of remission. Severe attacks have rarely been associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">bradycardia/asystole</span> resulting in syncope, presumably because input from cranial nerve IX into the tractus solitarius has an effect upon the dorsal motor nucleus of the cranial nerve X [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Diagnostic criteria for glossopharyngeal neuralgia, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3), require all of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least three attacks of unilateral pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain is located in the posterior part of the tongue, tonsillar fossa, pharynx, beneath the angle of the lower jaw <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the ear</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain has at least three of the following four characteristics:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurring in paroxysmal attacks lasting from a few seconds to two minutes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe intensity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shooting, stabbing, or sharp in quality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Precipitated by swallowing, coughing, talking, or yawning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No clinically evident neurological deficit</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis</p><p/><p>As with trigeminal neuralgia, there are idiopathic and secondary forms of glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Secondary causes include demyelinating lesions, cerebellopontine angle tumor, peritonsillar abscess, carotid aneurysm, and Eagle syndrome (in which cranial nerve IX is compressed laterally against an ossified stylohyoid ligament) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Vascular compression of cranial nerves IX and X can occur at the nerve root entry zone by the vertebral artery or posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The differential diagnosis of glossopharyngeal neuralgia includes nervus intermedius neuralgia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Nervus intermedius neuralgia'</a> below.)</p><p>The evaluation of a patient suspected of suffering from glossopharyngeal neuralgia includes a thorough history, especially inquiring about the presence of trigger factors and nocturnal awakening. A careful intraoral and neck examination (eg, done by a specialist in otorhinolaryngology) should be undertaken to help exclude local disease as a cause for the pain. <span class=\"nowrap\">MRI/MRA</span> is indicated in virtually all patients to rule out a mass lesion or vascular pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]; plain skull films may reveal an ossified stylohyoid ligament (consistent with Eagle syndrome).</p><p>Medical therapy of glossopharyngeal neuralgia is essentially the same as for trigeminal neuralgia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigeminal-neuralgia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigeminal neuralgia&quot;, section on 'Medical therapy'</a>). In addition, application of local anesthetics to the oropharynx may prove both diagnostic and therapeutic. Surgical treatment is considered for patients who fail medical therapy. Possible procedures including intracranial sectioning of cranial nerve IX plus the upper three to four rootlets of cranial nerve X at the jugular foramen, or vascular decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/28,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,33-35</a>]. The latter is a relatively safe procedure with good short-term and long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nervus intermedius neuralgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nervus intermedius (facial nerve) neuralgia is a rare disorder characterized by brief paroxysms of pain felt deeply in the auditory canal.

Extracranial bony or soft tissue metastases may impinge upon cranial and upper cervical nerves causing headache or facial pain. In addition, occult lung neoplasms may cause referred pain in the periauricular region. Facial pain due to cancer is discussed in detail separately.

Specific inquiry regarding prior dental procedures should be made of all patients with facial pain. The presence of provocative factors such as chewing or heat or cold sensitivity may provide useful clues. Trigeminal neuralgia also has been associated with ipsilateral dental pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporomandibular joint syndrome &ndash; Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome is characterized by chronic or acute musculoskeletal pain with dysfunction of the masticatory system. Many patients complain of headache or facial pain; in some cases, the disorder presents only as a headache without the patient being aware of a TMJ disturbance. The typical headache associated with TMJ syndrome presents as unilateral ear or preauricular pain that radiates to the jaw, temple, or neck. The pain is deep, dull, continuous, and usually worse in the morning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temporomandibular-disorders-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Temporomandibular disorders in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giant cell arteritis &ndash; Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a chronic vasculitis of large and medium sized vessels. Although systemic illness is characteristic of GCA and vascular involvement may be widespread, blood vessel inflammation most frequently involves the cranial branches of the arteries that originate from the aortic arch. The most feared complication of GCA, visual loss, is one potential result of the cranial arteritis associated with this disease. A new type of headache occurs in at least two-thirds of individuals affected with GCA. The head pain tends to be located over the temporal areas but can be frontal or occipital in location. The headaches may be mild or severe. The course is also variable; the headaches may become progressively worse, but can subside before treatment is started in some cases. Nearly one-half of GCA patients suffer from jaw claudication. In some cases, a trismus-like symptom occurs rather than fatigue of the chewing muscles. Tender temporal or occipital arteries are found in approximately one-third of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotidynia &ndash; The International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) recognizes a subtype of headache attributed to noninflammatory lesions affecting the cervical carotid or vertebral arteries. This category includes pain from arterial dissection, postendarterectomy headache, and headache attributed to carotid or vertebral angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Carotidynia is an older term that was used for pain that appears to emanate from the carotid artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Rather than a distinct entity, carotidynia is now considered a syndrome that encompasses many varieties of pain, including carotid dissection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H525094949\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous cerebral and cervical artery dissection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Local symptoms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-traumatic and postoperative pain &ndash; Facial pain can occur after trauma, including bullet wounds or other head injuries and surgery. Facial pain may occur after maxillofacial surgery, orbital enucleations, sinus, and dental procedures. Dental procedures can trigger a variety of syndromes, including neuralgia and facial migraine. In all cases of post-traumatic facial pain, a careful search must be conducted for underlying pathology, especially dental problems. Some patients manifest constant burning pain, occasionally with tingling and stabbing but without the trophic changes, edema, and redness that are characteristic of reflex sympathetic dystrophy (complex regional pain syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-craniofacial-pain/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Treatment of post-traumatic facial pain can be extremely difficult. Blockade of the stellate ganglion may be effective in patients who complain of significant burning pain. Brief lancinating pains may respond to agents useful for neuralgias. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a>, for example, can reduce pain and lessen associated depression. Other agents useful for treating migraine headaches have been employed empirically for symptomatic benefit. Post-traumatic facial pain generally resolves spontaneously within several years.</p><p/><p>Finally, primary headaches including migraine, cluster, and other headaches (such as paroxysmal hemicrania) can present mainly in the face. Careful attention to details of the history and examination should clarify the diagnosis. Questions revealing a family history, trigger factors, or the presence of an aura point toward migraine as the etiology. Similarly, cluster headache and other short lasting headaches may present with pain principally in the face rather than periorbital or retro-orbital regions. Characterizing the duration of the episodes, along with any associated autonomic features (ptosis, rhinorrhea, lacrimation) is diagnostically helpful.

(See <a href=\"#H1651832\" class=\"local\">'Burning mouth syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent idiopathic facial pain is characterized by persistent facial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oral pain in the absence of a neurologic deficit. Minor surgery or injury to the face, teeth, or gums may initiate the symptoms, which persist after healing without a clear local cause. The pain is commonly felt in the nasolabial fold or one side of the chin, but can spread to wider areas of the face and neck. Persistent idiopathic facial pain is a diagnosis of exclusion. (See <a href=\"#H1651597\" class=\"local\">'Persistent idiopathic facial pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central neuropathic pain is caused by a lesion or dysfunction in the central nervous system. The two main recognized causes are central neuropathic pain attributed to multiple sclerosis and central poststroke pain. (See <a href=\"#H93373286\" class=\"local\">'Central neuropathic facial pain'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-neuropathic-facial-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central neuropathic facial pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other causes of craniofacial pain include cancer, dental pain, temporomandibular joint syndrome, giant cell arteritis, noninflammatory lesions affecting the cervical carotid or vertebral arteries, post-traumatic and postoperative pain, and primary headaches.
