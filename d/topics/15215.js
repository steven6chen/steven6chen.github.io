Because of important differences between hematology and oncology patients with neutropenia, the risk of infection in hematology patients with different types of non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and fever are reviewed here. The management of fever and neutropenia in these patients and in children with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia are discussed separately.

The ANC is calculated using the following formula:</p><p>ANC = total white blood cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">(cells/microL)</span> x (percent neutrophils + percent bands) &divide; 100</p><p>Recognizing that the definition of a normal ANC varies with age and race is important. The lower limit of normal for the ANC in infants between two weeks and six months of age is lower than that for the older child <span class=\"nowrap\">(1000/microL</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">1500/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infection-in-children-with-fever-and-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Also, normal neutrophil values for people of African descent are lower than those for Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infection-in-children-with-fever-and-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The degree of neutropenia is classified as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild &ndash; ANC 1000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">1500/microL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &ndash; ANC 500 to <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe &ndash; ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/microL</span></p><p/><p>Most studies evaluating the significance of the degree of neutropenia on the risk of infection have been in cancer patients, in whom an increased risk of infection becomes apparent at an ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1000/microL,</span> is greater at <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/microL,</span> and is greatest at <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infection-in-children-with-fever-and-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In addition to the ANC, factors that influence a patient's susceptibility to infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of neutropenia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Function of the neutrophils</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability of the bone marrow to respond to an infectious insult</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Function of other components of the immune system</p><p/><p>These factors contribute to the differences in infectious complications that are observed between hematology patients with neutropenia and cancer patients with therapy-induced neutropenia. For example, neutropenia in the oncology patient is related to cytotoxic therapy and generally is self-limited, whereas in the patient with severe aplastic anemia, neutropenia may be prolonged for months to years. However, the neutropenic oncology patient often has defects in several arms of the immune system because of the underlying disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapeutic agents used, and these defects may not exist in the hematology patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FEVER AND NEUTROPENIA IN THE OTHERWISE HEALTHY CHILD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The afebrile child with the finding of isolated neutropenia may be followed with serial blood counts and examinations since, in most cases, the neutropenia arises in association with a viral infection and is transient, resolving in one to two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infection-in-children-with-fever-and-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Drugs, such as antibiotics and anticonvulsants, also can cause neutropenia that most often resolves after cessation of the drug. However, if such a child develops fever, or if a previously healthy child is found to have isolated neutropenia during a febrile illness, appropriate management requires consideration of the risk of serious bacterial infection. Such scenarios are not uncommon. In contrast to the wealth of studies in oncology patients with fever and neutropenia, only a few have been conducted in patients with non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.</p><p>One retrospective study to establish the risk of infection was performed in 119 well-appearing children without underlying comorbid illnesses who were found to be neutropenic, nine severely so, during minor acute illnesses, routine preoperative screening, or treatment for common childhood conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infection-in-children-with-fever-and-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. No patients with neutropenia lasting less than 30 days developed infectious complications. Of the 36 patients found to be neutropenic for more than 30 days, only four (11 percent) developed infectious complications. The four infections were stomatitis (2), cellulitis (1), and pneumonia (1).</p><p>Another retrospective study examined the outcomes of patients presumed to be immunocompetent who presented to a pediatric primary care clinic or pediatric emergency department with fever and newly identified moderate to severe neutropenia, leukopenia, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infection-in-children-with-fever-and-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This study found that leukopenia and neutropenia did not necessarily occur together. The prevalence of bacteremia was 5.5 percent, and while neither the degree of neutropenia nor leukopenia predicted bacteremia, nearly all bacteremic children were toxic-appearing at presentation. The prevalence of other infections was 14 percent, and the most common of these was pneumonia.</p><p>A retrospective case-control study examined 71 children aged 3 months to 18 years presenting with fever of at least 38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) and neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span> or less who had not received antibiotics in the 48 hours before presentation and 71 age-matched controls (consecutive febrile patients who underwent complete blood count and blood culture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infection-in-children-with-fever-and-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Serious bacterial infections (eg, bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, dysentery) were more common in the control group (27 versus 8 percent). Of 14 children with severe neutropenia (ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;500/microL),</span> two had bacterial pneumonia. Rash was more common in neutropenic children (23 versus 6 percent), which the authors speculate may have been consistent with viral exanthems in the neutropenic children. More children in the control group received antibiotics (55 versus 28 percent), and there was a nonsignificant trend toward increased admission rates in the control group (66 versus 49 percent; p = 0.06).</p><p>A prospective study of 161 previously healthy children aged 3 months to 14 years (mean age 3 years) with febrile neutropenia sought to determine the clinical course, complications, and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-infection-in-children-with-fever-and-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The majority of patients had mild to moderate transient neutropenia (most resolved in &lt;30 days) associated with viral infections. Twenty-five (15.5 percent) of 161 patients had chronic neutropenia (&gt;180 days); an infectious agent was associated with the initial diagnosis in only five children. Two years after the diagnosis of febrile neutropenia, 6 of 143 children (4.2 percent) available for evaluation remained neutropenic without a cause identified. Three of these patients suffered infectious complications: periorbital cellulitis, <em>Pseudomonas </em>sepsis with labial abscess, and a severe bacterial infection in a patient diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome.</p><p>These, albeit limited, observations suggest that the otherwise well-appearing child with isolated neutropenia and fever can be managed safely with age-appropriate treatment of any minor acute illness and frequent follow-up. However, any ill-appearing child with fever and neutropenia must be considered at risk for a serious bacterial infection and should receive empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy.

The majority of invasive fungal disease was caused by <em>Aspergillus</em> spp, followed by <em>Candida</em> spp. Ten of 11 <em>Aspergillus</em> infections were pulmonary.

The major exception was the finding that <em>Aspergillus</em> spp were the dominant fungi, which likely is due to the prolonged duration of neutropenia observed in many patients with aplastic anemia; <em>Candida</em> spp are most common in cancer patients.
