MTC accounts for approximately 1 to 2 percent of thyroid cancers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The production of calcitonin is a characteristic feature of this tumor. The C cells originate from the embryonic neural crest; as a result, medullary carcinomas often have the clinical and histologic features of other neuroendocrine tumors such as carcinoid and islet-cell tumors.</p><p>Most medullary thyroid carcinomas are sporadic. However, approximately 25 percent are familial as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, evaluation, and clinical staging of MTC will be covered in this topic review. Treatment of this disorder is discussed separately. MEN2 is reviewed in detail elsewhere.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-genetics-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and genetics of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-therapy-in-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to therapy in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1589428\"><span class=\"h2\">Sporadic MTC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) accounts for approximately 75 percent of all cases of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F85653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85653 \">table 1</a>). The typical age of presentation is in the fourth and sixth decades of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptoms and signs</strong> &ndash; The most common presentation of sporadic MTC is that of a solitary thyroid nodule, which occurs in 75 to 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The C cells are predominantly located in the upper portion of each thyroid lobe; thus, most tumors are located in this region. In most patients with MTC, the disease has already metastasized at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 70 percent of patients have clinically detectable cervical lymph node involvement, up to 15 percent have symptoms of upper aerodigestive tract compression or invasion such as dysphagia or hoarseness, and approximately 5 to 10 percent have distant metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. Distant metastases may occur in the liver, lung, bones, and less often, brain and skin. Nodal metastases are more common in patients with multifocal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, as calcitonin screening results in the identification of more &quot;micro&quot; medullary cancers, the number of patients with metastases at presentation appears to be decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Calcitonin screening for MCT in patients with thyroid nodules is controversial. (See <a href=\"#H1589349\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Serum calcitonin concentration'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Systemic symptoms may occur due to hormonal secretion by the tumor. Tumor secretion of calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, or other substances can cause diarrhea or facial flushing in patients with advanced disease. In addition, occasional tumors secrete corticotropin (ACTH), causing ectopic Cushing's syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biochemical tests</strong> &ndash; Basal serum calcitonin concentrations usually correlate with tumor mass but also reflect tumor differentiation, and they are almost always high in patients with a palpable tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most MTCs also secrete carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which, like calcitonin, can be used as a tumor marker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition, the expression of CEA on MTC cells has led to the use of anti-CEA antibodies for immunotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-chemotherapy-and-immunotherapy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Chemotherapy and immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Immunotherapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thyroid function tests are normal in patients with MTC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging</strong> &ndash; There are several ultrasound features of thyroid nodules (eg, hypoechoic, microcalcifications) that are associated with thyroid cancer risk. However, there are no ultrasound features that are pathognomonic for thyroid cancer. Furthermore, the majority of studies evaluating suspicious ultrasound characteristics of nodules focused on papillary thyroid cancer (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical utility of ultrasonography in thyroid disease&quot;, section on 'Criteria for identifying cancer'</a>). In a small retrospective study examining the ultrasound characteristic of nodules that were histologically proven to be MTC and papillary thyroid cancer, 50 percent of MTCs were solid and hypoechoic and 16 percent showed microcalcifications, compared with 69.2 and 69.2 percent, respectively, for papillary thyroid cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The presence of at least one suspicious ultrasound feature was almost equal in patients with MTC (58.3 percent) and controls with benign nodules (55.5 percent), whereas it was significantly more frequent in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (100 percent). In other series, hypoechogenicity was present in 50 to 89 percent and microcalcifications in 30 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>], and there was no difference in echogenicity or the presence or type of calcifications between MTC and papillary thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Large areas of calcification (macrocalcification) were noted in 16 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rarely, the diagnosis of MTC is suggested by the presence of dense calcifications seen on radiographs or imaging of the anterior neck.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Inherited MTC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is subclassified into two distinct syndromes (MEN2A and MEN2B) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F101551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101551 \">table 2</a>), each of which is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion and is associated with MTC. These syndromes result from different mutations in the <em>RET</em> proto-oncogene. In the past, familial MTC (FMTC, an inherited syndrome characterized by the presence of only MTC without hyperparathyroidism or pheochromocytoma) was considered a separate entity but is now considered a variant of MEN2A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Hereditary MTC is typically bilateral and multicentric (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classical MEN2A is associated with MTC, pheochromocytoma, and primary parathyroid hyperplasia. While the penetrance of MTC is nearly 100 percent, there is inter- and intrafamily variability in the specific pattern of the other disease manifestations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MEN2B shares the inherited predisposition to MTC and pheochromocytoma present in classical MEN2A, but does not include hyperparathyroidism. MTC occurs in almost all patients. The tumor develops at an earlier age and may be more aggressive than in MEN2A. Patients typically have a marfanoid habitus (but do not have Marfan syndrome), mucosal neuromas, and intestinal ganglioneuromatosis.</p><p/><p>In the index case, the clinical presentation and manifestations of MEN2-associated MTC are similar to those of sporadic MTC. The most common presentation is that of a solitary thyroid nodule or cervical lymphadenopathy. Early diagnosis (prior to any clinical manifestations) by screening of &quot;at-risk&quot; family members in MEN2 kindreds is important because MTC is a life-threatening disease that can be cured or prevented by early thyroidectomy.

The sensitivity of FNA is 50 to 80 percent, although higher sensitivity can be obtained by the addition of immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. If the clinical suspicion for MTC is high (eg, patient with diarrhea, flushing, and a thyroid nodule), calcitonin can be measured in the washout of the FNA biopsy needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], although this may not be readily available in many commercial laboratories.</p><p>In some cases, the diagnosis of MTC is made after thyroid lobectomy for a suspicious or indeterminate FNA biopsy. Surgical specimens from patients with MTC show spindle-shaped and frequently pleomorphic cells without follicle development because these cells originate from the calcitonin-producing parafollicular C cells of the thyroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82093 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>The use of serum calcitonin screening to complement ultrasound and FNA in the routine diagnosis of thyroid nodules is controversial in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Measurement of serum calcitonin has not been a part of the routine evaluation of patients with thyroid nodules in the United States. The high frequency of falsely high serum calcitonin values, the inability to confirm the high calcitonin by pentagastrin stimulation in the United States, and the accuracy of FNA biopsy would argue against a change in this recommendation. Further, occasional patients with locoregional metastases or locally invasive MTC will have normal unstimulated serum calcitonin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In some countries (eg, European countries) where pentagastrin is available, however, serum basal and stimulated calcitonin levels are routinely used in the evaluation of thyroid nodules to facilitate the preoperative diagnosis of MTC. This topic is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Serum calcitonin concentration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9087292\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis in a patient presenting with a neck mass is extensive and varies with the age of the patient at presentation. The majority of these masses represent benign thyroid nodules and cysts (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;</a>). Neck masses that are not of thyroidal origin may be from congenital (ie, vascular anomaly), inflammatory (lymph node enlargement), or other neoplastic (primary or metastatic disease) disorders. The differential diagnosis of a neck mass is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-a-neck-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of a neck mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), elevated calcitonin results may also be seen in patients with hypercalcemia, hypergastrinemia, neuroendocrine tumors, renal insufficiency, papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas, goiter, and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> (greater than two to four months), beta blockers, and glucocorticoids has been associated with hypercalcitoninemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, the presence of heterophilic antibodies to calcitonin can falsely elevate serum calcitonin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels can also occur in patients with heterophilic antibodies, gastrointestinal tract inflammatory disease, benign lung disease, and nonthyroid malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cigarette smoking may also elevate CEA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) on the basis of cytologic evaluation of a thyroid nodule, evaluation should include measurement of serum calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), ultrasonography of the neck (if not already performed), genetic testing for germline <em>RET</em> mutations, and biochemical evaluation for coexisting tumors, especially pheochromocytoma. Our approach outlined below is largely consistent with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guidelines for Management of Medullary Thyroid Cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F102747\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102747 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1216809\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum calcitonin and CEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentrations should be measured in patients diagnosed with MTC on the basis of cytologic evaluation of a thyroid nodule. These tests can establish that the tumor is capable of hypersecreting the hormones and, if so, the values can be compared with postoperative values. Postoperatively, results may provide a prognostic factor or indicate biochemical cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In a study of 226 patients with MTC (50 percent sporadic MTC, 33 percent multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN] type 2A [MEN2A], 1 percent MEN type 2B [MEN2B], and 16 percent familial MTC [FMTC]), preoperative serum calcitonin concentrations were significantly correlated with tumor size in both the sporadic and familial cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, among 45 patients who had a preoperative serum calcitonin concentration of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> or less, 44 had normal concentrations after surgery. In contrast, only 50 of 120 patients with preoperative serum calcitonin concentrations higher than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> had normal concentrations after surgery. In a second study of 224 patients with MTC, 28 of 45 patients (62 percent) without nodal metastases had normal calcitonin postoperatively, while only 18 of 177 (10 percent) of node positive patients had normal postoperative calcitonin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Assessment of calcitonin and CEA doubling times postoperatively provides sensitive markers for progression and aggressiveness of metastatic MTC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. As an example, postoperative calcitonin doubling time was a prognostic factor for survival in a study of 65 patients followed for 3 to 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

When MTC is diagnosed by fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, ultrasonography of the neck is indicated to look for cervical lymph node involvement.</p><p>For patients with local lymph node metastases on ultrasound or with preoperative serum basal calcitonin &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (indicating high risk of local or distant metastatic disease), additional imaging is required to assess for metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In this setting, we suggest cross-sectional imaging including chest computed tomography (CT), neck CT, three-phase contrast-enhanced liver CT or contrast-enhanced liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), axial MRI, and bone scintigraphy.</p><p>In patients suspected of having skeletal metastases, MRI may be superior to other imaging modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>We do not recommend 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging or somatostatin receptor imaging for routine initial screening for metastatic disease.

Initial germline testing in patients with C cell hyperplasia or apparently sporadic MTC should include sequencing of exons 10, 11, and 13 through 16 of the <em>RET</em> gene. Sequencing of the remaining exons in the <em>RET</em> gene should be considered in patients with clinical features or family history highly suggestive of hereditary medullary syndromes who demonstrate no mutations in exons 10, 11, or 13 through 16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. While it is possible for clinicians to directly order genetic testing from reference laboratories, we strongly encourage consultation with genetic counselors who are familiar with both the ethical issues and legal informed consent requirements (which can vary significantly in different regions) that are involved in germline testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>When the index patient is positive for a germline mutation, family members should be offered genetic counselling and genetic screening.

Studies of unselected patients with MTC have found, on average, that approximately 6 to 7 percent (range 1.5 to 24 percent) have germline <em>RET</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. In one report, 35 of 482 patients (7.3 percent) with apparently sporadic MTC had mutations, and in 18 of these 35, gene carriers were identified in relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Seventy-five percent of the familial medullary cases had no prior family history.</p><p>A much higher percentage (approximately 60 percent) of patients with sporadic MTC have <strong>somatic</strong> (acquired) mutations in the <em>RET</em> gene within the tumor cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F85653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85653 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. These mutations are present only in the tumor cells and are not detected by standard genetic testing, ie, using leukocyte DNA.

The production of calcitonin is a characteristic feature of this tumor. Most cases are sporadic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F85653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85653 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A solitary thyroid nodule is the most common presentation of sporadic MTC (in 75 to 95 percent of patients). In most patients, the disease has already metastasized at the time of diagnosis. Basal serum calcitonin concentrations usually correlate with tumor mass, but also reflect tumor differentiation, and are almost always high in patients with a palpable tumor. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of sporadic MTC is usually made after fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy in a patient who has a solitary thyroid nodule (or a dominant nodule within a multinodular goiter) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56242 \">picture 1</a>). The sensitivity of FNA is improved by the addition of immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin. The routine use of serum calcitonin screening to complement FNA in the routine diagnosis of thyroid nodules is controversial in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H1589349\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Serum calcitonin concentration'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients diagnosed with MTC on the basis of cytologic evaluation of a thyroid nodule, evaluation should include measurement of serum calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), ultrasonography of the neck (if not already performed), genetic testing for germline <em>RET</em> mutations, and biochemical evaluation for coexisting tumors, especially pheochromocytoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F102747\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102747 \">algorithm 1</a>). For patients with local lymph node metastases on ultrasound or with preoperative serum basal calcitonin &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (indicating high risk of local or distant metastatic disease), additional imaging is required to assess for metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with apparently sporadic MTC have unsuspected germline <em>RET</em> mutations (the underlying defect in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 [MEN2]) and, therefore, heritable disease. We suggest germline <em>RET</em> testing to all patients with newly diagnosed C cell hyperplasia or apparently sporadic MTC. (See <a href=\"#H1589190\" class=\"local\">'Genetic screening in sporadic MTC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the possibility that any patient with MTC may have MEN2, if results of germline <em>RET</em> testing are unknown (or positive), preoperative testing must also include measurement of serum calcium (to rule out hyperparathyroidism requiring concomitant surgical intervention) and testing for pheochromocytoma. We suggest plasma fractionated metanephrines as the initial screen for pheochromocytoma. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Testing for coexisting tumors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of MTC is discussed in detail separately.
