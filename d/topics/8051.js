It occurs more frequently in males. Hematogenous osteomyelitis most commonly involves the vertebral bones; the next most common sites are the flat bones of the axial skeleton, such as the clavicle and pelvis. Less frequently, the long bones of the appendicular skeleton can be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults will be reviewed here.

The proportion of adult cases may be increasing as the mean age of the population rises in the United States and developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Most cases in adults are observed in patients over age 50, with the exception of intravenous drug users (the majority of whom are under age 40) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Hematogenous osteomyelitis is also associated with intravascular devices including vascular catheters and cardiovascular devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and other risk factors for bacteremia (eg, dialysis, sickle cell disease, urethral catheterization, urinary tract infection, intravenous drug abuse).</p><p>The site of infection varies with age. In children, the most common sites of involvement are the long bones (eg, femur, tibia, and humerus); vertebral osteomyelitis accounts for only 1 to 2 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In adults, the long bones are rarely involved; the major sites of infection are the vertebrae and the sternoclavicular and pelvic bones (the last two most commonly occurring in intravenous drug users) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-osteomyelitis-and-other-infections-of-the-bony-pelvis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic osteomyelitis and other infections of the bony pelvis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among adult patients with hematogenous infection of the hip, magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated that infection commonly extends distal to the femoral head into the medullary canal of the femur or acetabulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Among patients with vertebral osteomyelitis, the lumbar vertebral bodies are most often involved, followed in frequency by the thoracic and cervical vertebrae. Spread to adjacent vertebral bodies may occur rapidly through the rich venous networks in the spine. Posterior extension may lead to epidural and subdural abscesses or even meningitis. Extension anteriorly or laterally can lead to paravertebral, retropharyngeal, mediastinal, subphrenic, retroperitoneal, or psoas abscesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of hematogenous osteomyelitis depends upon a clinical triad including presence of local or systemic immunocompromise, the number of organisms present and their virulence properties.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Host factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of infection in hematogenous osteomyelitis in children is thought to be due to specific features of long bone anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of long bone hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults, infection usually begins in the diaphysis but may spread to involve the entire medullary canal. Extension into the epiphysis and joint space can occur, since the growth plate has matured and shares vessels with the metaphysis. Since the periosteum is firmly adherent to the bone, cortical penetration usually leads to a soft tissue abscess. Subperiosteal abscesses and massive cortical devitalization occur rarely. Sinus tracts connecting the sequestered nidus of infection to the skin can develop over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of bacterial deposition in the metaphysis is unclear. Examination of the capillary loops of the metaphyseal vessels by electron microscopy has shown that the distal vessels are composed of a single layer of discontinuous endothelium through which tracer particles can escape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. It is possible that bacteria also pass through these gaps during an episode of bacteremia, thereby initiating osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, the metaphyseal capillaries lack phagocytic lining cells, and the sinusoidal veins contain functionally inactive phagocytic cells, both of which allow growth of microorganisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Any form of end-capillary obstruction, including intraosseous bleeding or subperiosteal hematoma as the result of minor trauma, can produce an area of avascular necrosis that is predisposed to infection.</p><p>The pathogenesis of vertebral osteomyelitis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-osteomyelitis-and-discitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of hematogenous osteomyelitis depends on the ability of specific bacteria to bind to host tissue and avoid clearance by the host immune response. Most cases of hematogenous osteomyelitis are due to <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Other bacterial species include <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (group A <em>Streptococcus</em>) and other <em>Streptococcus</em> species and more rarely <em>Kingella kingae</em>, <em>Enterococcus</em> species, and other coagulase-negative staphylococci including <em>Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, </em>and <em>Staphylococcus simulans</em>.</p><p><em>S. aureus </em>is by far the most commonly isolate; it has an array of virulence mechanisms to avoid the host immune response, more than 20 different toxins, and a plethora of adhesins known as &quot;microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules&quot; (MSCRAMMs). These adhesins can adhere to tissue by binding host proteins including fibronectin, fibrinogen, and collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Once bound, <em>S. aureus </em>organisms multiply, down-regulate adhesion production, up-regulate toxin secretion, and promote an ineffectual inflammatory host response that produces collateral host tissue damage. If inadequately treated with effective antibiotics and surgical intervention, <em>S. aureus</em> can form a mature biofilm. Once in this mature microbial community, bacteria are 100 to 1000 times more tolerant to antimicrobial agents than the free-floating planktonic bacteria seen during the acute phase of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The result is a disease where source control involves surgical removal of the infectious nidus and culture-directed antibiotics in order to resolve the infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteomyelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteomyelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematogenous osteomyelitis occurs after a bacteremia, although the bacteremia is not apparent in every case. Hematogenous osteomyelitis is usually monomicrobial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/9,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17-19</a>]. <em>S. aureus</em> is the most commonly isolated organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Aerobic gram-negative rods are identified in 30 percent of cases. <em>Salmonella</em> osteomyelitis is well described among patients with sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Serratia marcescens </em>are observed more frequently among intravenous drug users than other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A number of unusual pathogens have been reported, especially in vertebral osteomyelitis, including <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], <em>Candida </em>species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>], <em>Bartonella henselae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], <em>Coccidioides immitis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], and <em>Cutibacterium</em> (formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>)<em> acnes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Beta-hemolytic streptococcal osteomyelitis has occurred with increased frequency but remains relatively rare (&lt;1 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. <em>Aspergillus</em> osteomyelitis most commonly arises via a hematogenous mechanism and is frequently associated with immune compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In general, the microbiology of hematogenous osteomyelitis is established via microbial culture, which may be negative due to the inability to obtain the localized bacterial community during biopsy.

It generally occurs in patients &lt;25 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. It is usually of hematogenous origin but can also occur in the setting of trauma. The infectious focus consists of an abscess confined within a rim of sclerotic bone.</p><p>Patients typically present with the insidious onset of mild to moderate pain lasting for several weeks to months in the absence of trauma, with or without periosteal elevation or fever. If the subacute process progresses to chronic localized bone abscess, patients present with longstanding dull pain in the absence of fever. The lack of systemic signs such as fever often leads to misdiagnosis of symptoms as bone malignancy or sickle cell vasoocclusive pain crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Destructive changes in bone lag at least two weeks behind infection; approximately 50 to 75 percent of the bone matrix must be destroyed before plain radiographs demonstrate lytic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

In patients with sickle cell anemia, empiric therapy should cover also cover <em>Salmonella</em> and other gram-negative bacilli. In intravenous drug users, empiric treatment should cover both <em>S. aureus</em> and gram-negative bacilli. The optimal duration of therapy is uncertain; at least four weeks of parenteral antimicrobial therapy from the initiation of therapy or the last major debridement surgery are warranted.
