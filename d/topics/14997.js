The polymerization of deoxy hemoglobin S results in distortion of the red blood cell (RBCs) into the classic sickle shape and a marked decrease in red cell deformability and is the primary cause of vaso-occlusive phenomena [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Subsequent changes in red cell membrane structure and function, disordered cell volume control, and increased adherence to vascular endothelium also play an important role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Renal infarcts and papillary necrosis occur in either sickle cell disease or trait, with prevalence estimates of 30 to 40 percent in radiographic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Among patients with sickle cell disease, the prevalence of proteinuria has been estimated to be 20 to 25 percent, and decreased kidney function has been reported in 5 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

The incidence of renal failure in patients with sickle cell disease was best described in two related cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 25-year observational study of 725 patients with sickle cell disease (most of them children), 31 (4 percent) developed renal failure (defined as an irreversible rise in serum creatinine concentration) at a median age of 23 years, most of whom progressed to requiring dialysis within a few years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Twelve percent developed renal failure at a median age of 37 years. The higher rate and older age at the development of renal failure, compared with the earlier report, may reflect the addition of older patients to the cohort and extension of the observation period.</p><p/><p>Certain genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in the myosin heavy chain 9 (<em>MHY9</em>) and apolipoprotein L1 (<em>APOL1</em>) genes, are associated with a higher risk of proteinuria and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These genes are also associated with kidney disease in black patients without sickle cell disease.

Median survival among patients with and without renal failure was 29 and 51 years, respectively. The mortality risk of patients with renal failure was similar to those who had had a stroke.</p><p>Compared with patients with renal failure who do not have sickle cell disease, survival is substantially decreased among patients with renal failure and sickle cell disease whether treated with dialysis or transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>].

The later changes are mostly due to vascular dropout (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52364\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52364 \">image 1</a>). In patients who reach end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to sickle cell disease, renal biopsy shows glomerular enlargement and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], with the perihilar variant being most frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/11,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,24</a>]. A collapsing form of FSGS has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collapsing-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-not-associated-with-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis not associated with HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Histopathologically, the papillary necrosis associated with sickle cell disease can be differentiated from that associated with analgesic nephropathy. The former shows destruction of the vasa rectae and vascular congestion of the collecting ducts, inner medulla, and papillae. In analgesic nephropathy, vasa rectae are less often involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-analgesic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of analgesic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Less often, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with mesangial expansion and basement membrane duplication may be seen, either as an isolated finding or in association with FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. It has been proposed that this form of MPGN is caused by fragmented red blood cells (RBCs) lodged in isolated capillary loops and phagocytosed by mesangial cells, stimulating expansion of the mesangium and new basement membrane deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27</a>]. The particular absence of immune complexes and electron-dense deposits differentiates this from idiopathic MPGN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary event appears to be sickling of erythrocytes in the vasa recta capillaries in the medulla, leading to microthrombotic infarction and extravasation of blood in the medulla. Sickling is promoted by the normal medullary environment: low oxygen tension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77591\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77591 \">figure 1</a>), low pH, and high osmolality (which pulls water out of the red cells, thereby increasing the concentration of hemoglobin S) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80628\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80628 \">figure 2</a>). The increased blood viscosity contributes to ischemia and infarction in the renal microcirculation. More severe occlusions can lead to renal infarcts and papillary necrosis.</p><p>Glomerular ischemia appears to promote increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This is thought to be mediated primarily by vasodilator prostaglandins released presumably to reverse the medullary ischemia since it can be reversed by the administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Studies in transgenic mice suggest that increased glomerular nitric oxide synthesis also may contribute to the glomerular hyperfiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,31</a>]. In addition, there is glomerular hypertrophy contributing to a GFR that is preserved despite nephron damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>There is a correlation between glomerular hyperfiltration and chronic hemolysis. It has been suggested that this is due to increased cardiac output and a hemolysis-mediated increase in vascular tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Progressive renal failure (glomerulosclerosis) occurs due to continued glomerular ischemia; microangiopathic studies have demonstrated that the vasa recta are almost completely lost in older patients with sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,21</a>]. Endothelin 1 (ET-1), stimulated by glomerular hypoxia, may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Additional contributors include secondary hemodynamic injury, induced by the intraglomerular hypertension and hypertrophy that drive the initial hyperfiltration, and additional insults, such as analgesic nephropathy secondary to consumption of large doses of analgesics, especially NSAIDs.

As previously mentioned, these manifestations are generally less common or less severe in patients with sickle cell trait, with the exception of renal medullary carcinoma, which appears to be more frequent among patients with sickle cell trait. The age at presentation of the various manifestations of renal disease varies widely (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68540 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Painless microscopic or gross hematuria (due to papillary infarcts) is a common complaint that is also seen in patients with sickle trait. The renal bleeding is typically mild, unilateral (and predominantly left sided), and self-limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The predominant left-sided origin of the hematuria has been attributed to the greater length of the left renal vein and the &quot;nutcracker phenomenon.&quot; The compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery leads to increased blood pressure in the vein, thereby further increasing relative anoxia in the renal medulla, which promotes sickling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal infarction and papillary necrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More severe ischemia can lead to renal infarcts and papillary necrosis. Papillary necrosis commonly presents as painless gross hematuria and may be complicated by urinary tract infection (UTI) or obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28</a>]. Acute segmental or total renal infarcts may present with nausea, vomiting, flank or abdominal pain, fever, and presumably renin-mediated hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

Sickling in the vasa rectae presumably interferes with countercurrent exchange in the inner medulla, thereby leading to impairment of free water reabsorption. This defect is reversible by blood transfusions below the age of 10 years but is irreversible in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The net effect is that the maximum urine osmolality at age 10 years is only 400 to 450 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> as compared with 900 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> in individuals without sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>However, both antidiuretic hormone generation and urinary diluting capacity remain unperturbed in patients with sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The preservation of normal urinary diluting capacity is a result of intact reabsorptive function of the superficial loops of Henle of the cortical nephrons, which are supplied by peritubular capillaries and not the maximally affected vasa rectae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal tubular acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired distal hydrogen and potassium secretion can lead to an incomplete form of distal renal tubular acidosis, which can be associated with aldosterone-independent hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. Although the exact mechanism is not clear, medullary blood flow disturbance and hypoxia may lead to insufficient energy to maintain the hydrogen ion and electrochemical gradients along the collecting ducts. However, these impairments are usually mild and become clinically apparent only if there is a complicating factor, such as potassium or acid loading, intravascular volume depletion, or during rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/29,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36</a>].

As a result of impaired concentrating ability, they are predisposed to prerenal failure secondary to intravascular volume depletion. Intrinsic renal causes of AKI include rhabdomyolysis, sepsis, drug nephrotoxicity, renal vein thrombosis, and even hepatorenal syndrome (hemosiderosis-induced hepatic failure). Postrenal causes include urinary tract obstruction secondary to blood clots and, less commonly, papillary necrosis. The prognosis appears to be favorable, with one small study reporting a rate of recovery of 83 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>In one study, the incidence of AKI during vaso-occlusive crises or episodes was surprisingly low (&lt;5 percent) and appeared to be limited to those with acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary hypertension, suggesting a potential role for right ventricular dysfunction and venous congestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, a higher incidence of AKI (10 percent) was reported in another study of hospitalized patients with sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Such wide variation in results could probably be due to differing criteria used to define AKI and its timing of onset.</p><p>Biomarkers may correlate with early sickle cell nephropathy (eg, urinary endothelin 1 [ET-1] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/33,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,51</a>], neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and urinary transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]).

For patients age five years or older, we assess renal function every four to six months. Adults (ie, older than age 18 years) are screened every two to three months. Patients are screened for kidney disease with measurement of the serum creatinine, dipstick urinalysis for blood, determination of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio from a random (or &quot;spot&quot;) urine sample, and microscopic analysis of urine.
