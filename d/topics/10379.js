Recurrence is usually due to inadequate aortic wall growth at the site of repair when surgery is performed before the aorta has reached adult size. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Recoarctation'</a> below.)</p><p>A retrospective study of 70 children with aortic arch obstruction who underwent jump (bypass) graft placement from the ascending to the descending aorta found that, among patients who received a bypass graft of &ge;16 mm diameter, results were good (ie, no reoperations at 15 years); however, among neonates and infants who received smaller bypass grafts, outcomes were less favorable (7 early deaths, 6 late deaths, and 7 heart transplantations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

This was illustrated in a large multicenter retrospective study that included 422 angioplasty procedures for native aortic coarctation in patients with a median age of 4.2 years (range 2 days to 63 years) from 1982 to 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Balloon angioplasty is not as successful in infants with arch hypoplasia, which is commonly seen in neonatal and infantile aortic coarctation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Recoarctation occurs in most neonates after balloon angioplasty, even after an initial good result. Repeat balloon angioplasty is generally required within 5 to 12 weeks following the initial procedure. As a result, balloon angioplasty is <strong>not</strong> recommended for infants less than four months of age with aortic coarctation, especially if the lesion is accompanied by arch hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Palliative balloon angioplasty, however, may be considered in critically ill patients (irrespective of age) who have heart failure due to severe ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, or low cardiac output, or with systemic disease (such as Turner syndrome) that is affected by cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Children with aortic stent placement are more likely to require a planned reintervention as the stent often needs to be dilated as the child grows.</p><p>Stent placement is <strong>not</strong> generally recommended in patients less than 25 kg due to potential injury to the femoral artery from the large sheath required for stent delivery. In addition, the aorta in patients less than 25 kg is small. Although stents have been successfully placed in patients less than 30 kg, implanting a stent in such patients will commit them to repeated interventions to expand the stent as they grow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. The risks associated with repeat transcatheter interventions need to be balanced against the more invasive surgical repair. As a result, in our practice, we will only consider stent placement in patients who are large enough to receive a stent that can be expanded to an adult size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

All patients experienced immediate reduction in upper- to lower-extremity blood pressure difference with sustained improvement to two years. There were no deaths or serious adverse events and no patients required surgical intervention. During the first two years after stent placement, 9 patients required reintervention to address aneurysms or for stent redilation (either as part of an intentionally staged approach or to compensate for somatic growth). An additional 10 patients required reintervention after two years (seven for redilation of the stent and three for redilation and to address aneurysms).</p><p>Retrospective data from a multicenter case series of over 500 patients also demonstrated the efficacy and relative safety of stent placement for both native and recurrent coarctation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. In this cohort, the stent placement (which was predominantly bare metal) was successful in 98 percent of cases, defined as reduction in the gradient to &lt;20 mmHg or a ratio of post-stent coarctation to descending aorta of &gt;0.8. Acute complications occurred in 14 percent of patients including two procedure-related deaths. In 41 of 160 procedures with follow-up imaging (25 percent), aortic abnormalities were detected and included stent restenosis (n = 16), aneurysms (n = 13), and dissections (n = 5).</p><p>Although the complication rates with bare metal stents in these studies were low, it has been suggested that the use of covered stents, which consist of a bare metal stent with a polytetrafluoroethylene sleeve, may reduce the risk of aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. In the COAST I trial, 9 of the 105 patients who underwent attempted stent placement with a bare stent had evidence of aortic wall injury and therefore had covered stents placed (either at the initial procedure or after one to two years).</p><p>However, in a randomized trial of 120 adolescent and adult patients (mean age 23.6 years, range from 12 to 58 years) with short-segment severe native coarctation, there was no difference in the rates of recoarctation and pseudo-aneurysm formation after 31 months of follow-up between patients who underwent implantation using a bare stent and those with a covered stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In both groups, stent placement resulted in a 100 percent success rate, <strong>but</strong> only three-quarters of patients became normotensive after the procedure.</p><p>These results suggest that bare stents may be sufficient in many, if not most, patients that undergo stent placement and that further research is needed to determine if there is a subset of patients who truly benefit from the implantation of a covered versus bare stent. Follow-up data will also be important to see if there is a long-term benefit regarding maintaining normal blood pressure using covered stents. In the United States, commercially made covered stents are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but are available for clinical use in Europe and other parts of the world.

All three published guidelines recommend that correction of coarctation should be performed as early as possible (optimally early in childhood) to reduce the long-term morbidity and improve survival, and corrective surgery and percutaneous interventions are acceptable options for coarctation repair. The choice of intervention should be determined by a multidisciplinary team (ie, cardiologist, interventionists, and surgeons) experienced in treating patients with congenital heart disease and is dependent on the underlying morphology, age of the patient, and the presence or absence of other cardiac lesions.
