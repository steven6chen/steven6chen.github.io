Lung cancer computed tomographic (CT) screening studies of smokers at high risk for malignancy report a prevalence of nodules as high as 50 percent, with other CT studies in the general population reporting a prevalence of incidental nodules at 31 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-bronchoscopy-for-biopsy-of-peripheral-pulmonary-lesions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of PPLs detected by CT will likely increase in the future. There are an estimated 10 to 12 million CT scans of the chest performed per year in the United States and low dose CT scans are being increasingly performed for lung cancer screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-bronchoscopy-for-biopsy-of-peripheral-pulmonary-lesions/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In addition, newer generation CT scanners can detect very small pulmonary lesions not readily visible on older generation CT scanners. Thus, an increasing need for image-guided bronchoscopic (IGB) modalities capable of obtaining tissue safely from such lesions is predicted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1607935371\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND ETIOLOGY OF PERIPHERAL PULMONARY LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A peripheral pulmonary lesion ([PPL] also known as peripheral lung lesion [PLL]) is a pulmonary nodule (typically &lt;3 cm) that is located in the lung periphery. It can be solid or subsolid, benign or malignant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62644 \">table 1</a>), and in general is traditionally hard to biopsy using conventional flexible bronchoscopy. A more detailed definition and etiology of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) are discussed in detail separately.

This indication is the focus of this topic.

The presence of a pacemaker or defibrillator has been considered a relative contraindication to IGB techniques that involve the use of an electromagnetic field due to concerns that pacemaker or defibrillator function could be affected. However, a study of 24 patients with pacemakers and defibrillators who underwent ENB reported that none of the patients suffered any arrhythmia or disruption of pacemaker function and that the procedure was safely completed in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image-guided-bronchoscopy-for-biopsy-of-peripheral-pulmonary-lesions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Additional data in larger series are required to confirm these findings. Although practice among institutions is variable, we typically consult with cardiology subspecialty experts to determine whether settings need to be changed prior to the procedure; following ENB, we also have the pacemaker interrogated to make sure that the device is functioning properly. (See <a href=\"#H2840716089\" class=\"local\">'Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB)'</a> below.)</p><p>These techniques do not require contrast such that allergies to contrast is not a contraindication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3996664650\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGE-GUIDED BRONCHOSCOPY TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several image-guided bronchoscopy (IGB) techniques are available to assist in the biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs). In general, the use of these techniques are limited to centers with expertise and require specific training for their use. The diagnostic yield ranges from 44 to 88 percent, typically varying with lesion size, location, and equipment used as well as other factors including the presence of a bronchus sign and biopsy technique. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715859800\"><span class=\"h2\">Virtual bronchoscopy (VB)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtual bronchoscopy (VB) is a noninvasive form of bronchoscopy. It is not an endoscopic procedure, but rather an imaging modality that uses non-contrast-enhanced computed tomographic images to reconstruct the airways in a three-dimensional manner producing images that appear similar to those visualized during invasive bronchoscopy. While VB itself cannot acquire samples, it can be used to preplan future procedures or as a navigational tool for biopsy (VBN). Further details regarding VB are provided separately.

The RP-EBUS probe is passed through the working guide sheath, the PPL location is confirmed, the probe removed, and the lesion is biopsied as for routine flexible bronchoscopy (with or without fluoroscopy).

(See <a href=\"#H1850210231\" class=\"local\">'Radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other techniques including CT bronchoscopy and ultrathin bronchoscopy are rarely used and their role remains largely investigational. (See <a href=\"#H1376660513\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with PPLs in whom nonsurgical biopsy is indicated (eg, PPLs of intermediate risk of malignancy), when expertise is available, IGB techniques are appropriate alternatives to transthoracic needle biopsy particularly in patients who are at high risk of pneumothorax. Choosing among the options is individualized and depends upon factors including, lesion size, location, presence of emphysema, suspected diagnosis, and institutional expertise. (See <a href=\"#H646170899\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a biopsy modality'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IGB procedures can be performed with moderate sedation. However, deep <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/general</span> anesthesia is often required particularly when complex and lengthy procedures are expected. (See <a href=\"#H3640047752\" class=\"local\">'Sedation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IGB techniques are generally well-tolerated with reported complication rates ranging from 0 to 8 percent. Similar to standard bronchoscopy, the spectrum and rate of complications are procedure-related (eg, pneumothorax and bleeding) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sedation-related (eg, hypotension).
