The acute process is self-limited, rarely causes hepatic failure, and usually leads to chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection often follows a progressive course over many years and can ultimately result in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the need for liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goal of treatment is to eradicate HCV RNA, which is predicted by the achievement of a sustained virologic response (SVR), defined by the absence of HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction 12 weeks after stopping treatment. An SVR is associated with a 99 percent chance of being HCV RNA negative during long-term follow-up and can therefore be considered cure of the HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Achievement of an SVR has also been associated with improved clinical outcomes.

However, the cost of these new agents prevents universal delivery of antiviral therapy. When resources are constrained, prioritizing patients who may benefit most from antiviral treatment may be warranted. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H620696534\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient evaluation and selection for antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Deciding when to treat'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1658212657\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTION OF TREATMENT REGIMENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regimen selection for patients with genotype 1 infection should take into account the efficacy, duration, and adverse effect profile of the regimen, potential drug interactions, the patient's history of prior treatment, and the stage of fibrosis. For the individual patient, insurance and financial issues will also likely be an important consideration. This section discusses regimen selection by treatment history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93587\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93587 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109116\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109116 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4725633\" class=\"local\">'Treatment-na&iuml;ve patients'</a> below and <a href=\"#H91846024\" class=\"local\">'Treatment-experienced patients'</a> below.)</p><p>The various direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-containing regimens (including interferon-free and interferon-containing regimens) available for treatment of genotype 1 infection have not been studied head to head, but in trials are associated with sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in excess of 80 percent among treatment-na&iuml;ve patients. Interferon-free combination regimens have reported SVR rates in excess of 90 percent. In general, we recommend an interferon-free DAA combination regimen, as it avoids the substantial toxicity associated with interferon use. Of note, a DAA should <strong>not</strong> be used as monotherapy because of the strong likelihood of treatment failure and the potential to develop resistance. Additional details on the administration and efficacy of the various regimens are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H16319566\" class=\"local\">'Interferon-free regimens'</a> below.)</p><p>Other DAAs that are not available in the United States and are thus not discussed in this topic may be available in other resource-rich countries, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asunaprevir-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">asunaprevir</a> in Japan and Canada.

There is no clear efficacy benefit with the addition of weight-based <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> if &lt;75 kg or 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> if &ge;75 kg) to simeprevir plus sofosbuvir and we do not routinely use it. Nevertheless, given the overall limited data for this regimen, it is reasonable to add ribavirin in patients who have characteristics traditionally associated with suboptimal response to antiviral therapy (eg, cirrhosis, obesity, black race, unfavorable IL28B genotype) as long as there are no other factors such as marginal hemoglobin level or renal impairment that increase the risk of ribavirin-associated anemia. Given lower response rates, is not recommended for subtype 1a patients who have cirrhosis and the Q80K viral variant.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=simeprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Simeprevir</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir</a> is not an option for the following patients: those with a history of treatment failure with a protease inhibitor, those who use an essential drug that cannot be administered with simeprevir (or sofosbuvir) because of drug interactions, or those with some other contraindication to these agents. Additionally, in the United States, although the individual agents are available, the regimen has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, so some insurers may not be willing to pay for this regimen. </p><p>Trial-based evidence for the use of this regimen comes from the COSMOS and OPTIMIST studies. In the OPTIMIST-1 trial, 310 genotype 1-infected patients without cirrhosis were randomly assigned to 12 versus 8 weeks of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simeprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simeprevir</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Overall SVR rates were greater with 12 weeks of therapy (97 versus 83 percent with 8 weeks), which resulted in similar outcomes regardless of treatment history (97 and 95 percent in treatment-na&iuml;ve and experienced patients, respectively). Among patients with subtype 1a infection, the presence of the Q80K viral variant, which had been associated with decreased response rates to simeprevir plus peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>, was not associated with variable SVR rates. In contrast, in the OPTIMIST-2 study of 103 patients with cirrhosis, overall SVR rates with 12 weeks of simeprevir plus sofosbuvir were lower at 83 percent (88 and 79 percent in treatment-na&iuml;ve and experienced patients, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In particular, among the 34 subtype 1a-infected patients with the Q80K variant, the SVR rate was only 74 percent. </p><p>Prior limited data had suggested that 24 weeks of therapy might be more effective for patients with cirrhosis. In a pooled analysis of the cohorts in the COSMOS trial, which included 187 patients who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simeprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simeprevir</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir</a> with or without weight-based <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> for 12 or 24 weeks, there was a somewhat greater SVR rate with 24 versus 12 weeks of treatment among patients with cirrhosis (100 versus 86 percent), but the numbers were very small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults/abstract/20,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,70</a>]. The potential to improve on SVR rates with the 12 week regimen in cirrhotics had also been suggested by observational studies in which simeprevir plus sofosbuvir for 12 weeks resulted in SVR in 75 to 87 percent in the presence and 88 to 92 percent in the absence of cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. Results from the COSMOS trial also suggested that there was not a benefit to the addition of ribavirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]; the OPTIMIST studies did not evaluate ribavirin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. </p><p>The regimen was well tolerated in these studies, even among patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A). The most commonly reported adverse effects were fatigue, headache, and nausea. When observed, anemia and hyperbilirubinemia occurred predominantly in patients who also received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>. In other studies of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simeprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simeprevir</a> containing regimens, photosensitivity and rash have been reported and patients should thus be cautioned about this risk and instructed to use sun protective measures and limit sun exposure. </p><p>Pharmacologic issues with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simeprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simeprevir</a> may limit the use of this regimen. The elimination of simeprevir is by the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], and it should not be used in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh class B) or severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment because of increases in exposure of two- to fivefold. Additionally, simeprevir is oxidatively metabolized by CYP3A subfamily, which consists mainly of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A4 metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Therefore, coadministered drugs that are significant inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are expected to alter concentrations of simeprevir (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 1</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sofosbuvir</a> should not be used with Pg-p inducers, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> and St. John's wort, which can reduce its concentration. </p><p>Additional adverse effects and drug information, including pharmacokinetics and potential drug interactions, for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sofosbuvir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sofosbuvir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simeprevir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simeprevir</a> are discussed elsewhere.

An SVR is associated with a 99 percent chance of being HCV RNA negative during long-term follow-up and can therefore be considered cure of the HCV infection. (See <a href=\"#H148833304\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the growing availability of highly effective interferon-free regimens for genotype 1 infection, a curative all-oral treatment is becoming a possibility for the vast-majority of patients. However, the cost of these new agents prevents universal delivery of antiviral therapy. When resources are constrained, prioritizing patients who benefit most from antiviral treatment may be warranted. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.
