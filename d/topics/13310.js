Penicillin allergy in all of its forms is self-reported by about 5 to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Many of these patients have delayed forms of hypersensitivity, which typically begin more than six hours after the last administered dose and often after days of treatment. The epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of the most common types of delayed reactions to penicillins will be discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H134500252\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A drug allergy (or hypersensitivity) reaction is defined as a specific immunologic reaction to a drug. The classification and pathogenesis of drug allergies are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The World Allergy Organization (WAO) has recommended categorizing immunologic drug reactions based upon the timing of the appearance of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This system defines two general types of reactions: immediate and delayed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immediate reactions</strong> &ndash; Immediate reactions classically begin within one hour of the <strong>initial</strong> dose in a course or within one hour of the last administered dose. Symptoms may appear slightly later if the drug was administered orally or taken with food so that absorption is slowed. Nevertheless, the period of one hour identifies many of these reactions. When allergic sensitization first develops, the initial symptoms may appear during the latter days of treatment (ie, not following the first dose of the course) but usually within one hour of the last administered dose and then escalate rapidly. Immediate reactions to penicillins are often immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, and signs and symptoms reflect widespread activation of mast cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100732 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delayed (nonimmediate) reactions</strong> &ndash; Delayed (nonimmediate) reactions usually appear after more than one dose of drug and typically after days of treatment. For example, delayed cutaneous maculopapular eruptions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> classically start on day 7 to 10 of treatment and may even begin 1 to 3 days after cessation of treatment. The symptoms typically begin several hours after the last administered dose, although the timing relative to the last administered dose is variable. However, symptoms should <strong>not</strong> begin within one hour of the <strong>initial</strong> dose of a medication. There are different mechanisms underlying various forms of delayed reactions, but they are not IgE-mediated.</p><p/><p>Although this classification is helpful in many cases, patients often do not recall the timing with which symptoms began, and not all drug reactions can be temporally classified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H878326177\"><span class=\"h1\">TAKING A USEFUL DRUG ALLERGY HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penicillins include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural penicillins &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-v-potassium-oral-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Penicillin V</a> (oral), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> (parenteral), benzathine penicillin (intramuscular), and procaine penicillin (intramuscular)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antistaphylococcal penicillins &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dicloxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dicloxacillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cloxacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cloxacillin</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aminopenicillins &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amoxicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extended spectrum penicillins &ndash; Carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin</a></p><p/><p>Hypersensitivity reactions to any of these drugs would correctly be considered a penicillin allergy. It is useful to name commonly used penicillins (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, specific brand names), as patients may recognize a brand name but not realize it is a penicillin. It is also worthwhile to ask if the patient has avoided penicillins since the reaction, because in some cases, patients had been given a penicillin again despite a reported allergy, and if it was tolerated, then the patient is not allergic to penicillins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H591593552\"><span class=\"h2\">Focused questions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with past reactions to penicillins, the history should focus on symptoms and concomitant illnesses, especially respiratory viral infections in children, as many cutaneous reactions occur when patients are given penicillins in the setting of a viral illness. Another important goal of the history is the detection of severe forms of delayed drug reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The history of a drug reaction should ascertain the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What penicillin was taken at the time of the reaction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dose and route of medication taken (if known)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other concurrent medications, especially if they were new or temporary</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The timing of onset of the reaction (both time between the last dose and onset of symptoms, as well as time of symptom onset relative to the start of therapy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age of the patient when the reaction occurred</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indication for the drug and whether the patient had symptoms of a viral illness at the time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The signs and symptoms involved and whether there was any blistering or exfoliation of the skin or mucous membrane involvement or signs of organ involvement other than the skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any treatment given for the reaction and response to that treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long the reaction took to resolve</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any prior or subsequent history of exposure to the same drug or structurally similar drugs, with or without reactions</p><p/><p>If the patient gives a history consistent with one of the serious types of systemic reactions discussed below, a concerted attempt to review the medical records describing the patient's presentation and care should be made. (See <a href=\"#H134503283\" class=\"local\">'Rare reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H698754152\"><span class=\"h2\">Warning signs of potentially severe reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some serious forms of delayed reactions can begin with a maculopapular eruption and then progress to more severe signs and symptoms. Warning signs of serious and potentially life-threatening drug reactions, such as SJS or TEN, include significant fever (&gt;38&deg;C or 100.4&deg;F), facial edema, involvement of mucosal membranes, skin tenderness or pain, and blistering (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86557\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86557 \">table 2</a>). Patients should contact their clinician immediately if any of these signs occur. (See <a href=\"#H1573037792\" class=\"local\">'Systemic'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H134502982\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON CUTANEOUS REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common allergic reactions to penicillins are delayed cutaneous reactions. These simple drug eruptions do not involve systemic symptoms or evidence of specific organ involvement, other than the skin. They are believed to be mediated by T cells in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Common cutaneous reactions should not involve significant fever, although fever may be present in the context of an underlying infection. In contrast, fever that begins after the acute infection has begun to subside and corresponds with the onset of new cutaneous findings is more concerning for the early stages of one of the more severe drug reactions. In this case, the penicillin should be stopped immediately, and the patient should be evaluated for other signs of severe reactions. (See <a href=\"#H698754152\" class=\"local\">'Warning signs of potentially severe reactions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1150384892\"><span class=\"h2\">Types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two types of delayed cutaneous reactions reported with penicillins are maculopapular eruptions and urticarial eruptions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279796801\"><span class=\"h3\">Maculopapular cutaneous eruptions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maculopapular (also called morbilliform) cutaneous eruptions are the most common type of hypersensitivity reaction to beta-lactam antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These reactions typically consist of erythematous macules or papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86509%7EDERM%2F54205%7EALLRG%2F70062%7EDERM%2F86552\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86509 graphicRef54205 graphicRef70062 graphicRef86552 \">picture 1A-D</a>). The individual lesions are relatively fixed and stay in place for days once developed. The involved areas tend to expand over several days. Pruritus is variable and when present can be intense. However, nonpruritic maculopapular rashes that develop during the course of therapy are reported in up to 7 percent of children given <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], although lower rates (&lt;5 percent) are more typical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Penicillins are among the most common causes of maculopapular eruptions, and the aminopenicillins (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>) are more often implicated than other penicillins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. The aminopenicillins are associated with maculopapular eruptions in up to 5 to 10 percent of patients, particularly in children in the setting of a viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The onset of the eruption is usually within one to two weeks after beginning therapy and sometimes much shorter (ie, within days) in a patient who previously reacted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Occasionally, an eruption to penicillins may begin as late as three weeks after beginning the antibiotic or first appear up to two weeks after the therapy was completed. Delayed cutaneous reactions resolve once the culprit penicillin is discontinued and sometimes even if the antibiotic is continued. Resolution is usually apparent within 7 to 14 days, although symptoms may initially worsen for a few days after the drug is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This type of drug reaction occurs with multiple antibiotics and is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exanthematous (maculopapular) drug eruption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279796926\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed urticarial eruptions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed urticarial eruptions (sometimes with associated angioedema) are another common form of cutaneous reaction to penicillins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It is important to make sure that the reaction did <strong>not</strong> involve other symptoms of an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reaction<strong> </strong>(ie, difficulty breathing, bronchospasm [cough, wheeze], throat tightness, voice change, recurrent vomiting, lightheadedness, change of mental status, hypotension). These reactions are particularly prevalent in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Symptoms begin after multiple doses, and may occur immediately or hours after the last administered dose. However, because urticaria and angioedema can be features of IgE-mediated immediate reactions and IgE-mediated reactions can involve anaphylaxis, patients with isolated urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema should generally be evaluated by an allergy specialist. This evaluation is reviewed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-skin-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin skin testing&quot;</a>). The possibility of performing graded challenge without prior skin testing in pediatric patients with delayed maculopapular and urticarial reactions is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1503932997\" class=\"local\">'Studies in children'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H134503014\"><span class=\"h2\">Relationship with viral infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of concurrent systemic viral infections may predispose to delayed cutaneous reactions (both maculopapular and delayed urticaria), particularly in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The best described example is the occurrence of a nonpruritic morbilliform rash in more than 90 percent of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> during acute infections with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection also have higher rates of reactions to various antibiotics, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of concomitant viral infections was evaluated in a study of 88 children presenting to the emergency department with delayed cutaneous reactions while taking beta-lactam antibiotics, in which all patients were tested for common childhood viral infections and then later evaluated for drug reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Two-thirds of the children had one or more positive viral studies, suggesting that viral infection is important in the pathogenesis of many drug-related eruptions in this age group. Reactions consisted of morbilliform rashes (41 patients) or urticarial rashes (47 patients) (without other symptoms of anaphylaxis). Symptoms appeared more than one hour after the last administered dose (for inclusion in the study) and an average of 4.9 days after the start of the medication. The signs and symptoms lasted an average of 3.8 days after the medication was stopped. The results of allergy testing and challenge in this study are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1503932997\" class=\"local\">'Studies in children'</a> below.)</p><p>The mechanism by which viral infections modify immune responses to antibiotics is not clear. One theory proposes that the release of interferons during viral infections leads to increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) receptors (along with processed drug) on antigen-presenting cells in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H878326222\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed cutaneous reactions to penicillins are diagnosed based upon clinical history, in most cases. However, if the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/caregiver</span> cannot provide a detailed description of the previous reaction, caution is warranted. The more distant a reaction, the more uncertain are its manifestations and the more difficult it is to obtain the medical record. If there is any doubt about the nature of the previous reaction, an objective allergy evaluation to exclude immediate allergy is warranted. Because penicillins are such a common cause of immediate allergy, clinicians should <strong>not</strong> assume that a vague reaction history (eg, &quot;rash&quot;) represents a simple cutaneous reaction.</p><p>If there is any uncertainty about the accuracy of the history, the safest approach is to refer the patient for an allergy evaluation before additional use of penicillins is considered. (See <a href=\"#H3695632810\" class=\"local\">'Referral for allergy evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maculopapular cutaneous eruptions</strong> &ndash; It can reasonably be assumed that the patient had a delayed maculopapular cutaneous reaction if the history clearly suggests macular or papular lesions limited to the skin, with or without pruritus, which began more than one hour (and usually several hours) after the last administered dose and did not feature urticaria or angioedema, systemic symptoms, or warning signs of the more severe forms of delayed drug reactions. (See <a href=\"#H698754152\" class=\"local\">'Warning signs of potentially severe reactions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H134503283\" class=\"local\">'Rare reactions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delayed urticarial eruptions</strong> &ndash; Reactions that involve isolated urticaria or urticaria and angioedema, without other symptoms of an IgE-mediated allergic reaction (ie, difficulty breathing, bronchospasm [cough, wheeze], throat tightness, voice change, recurrent vomiting, lightheadedness, change of mental status, hypotension) that begin more than one hour after the last administered dose are consistent with delayed urticarial eruptions. We advocate referral of patients with these reactions to an allergy specialist. (See <a href=\"#H3695632810\" class=\"local\">'Referral for allergy evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Laboratory studies and skin biopsy are not necessary for delayed cutaneous reactions, unless more serious reactions are in the differential diagnosis. In the United States, neither in vitro (eg, lymphocyte activation tests) nor skin testing (intradermal testing with delayed reading or patch testing) is widely utilized in the diagnosis of delayed cutaneous reactions, although these techniques are more commonly employed in other countries at specialty referral centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>].

Oral antihistamines may be administered at age-appropriate doses if there is a pruritic component. Oral glucocorticoids may be considered in patients with severe eruptions who do not respond to or are unable to tolerate antihistamines. Specific treatment measures are reviewed separately.

We advocate that readministration be supervised by an allergy specialist when possible and occur in a medically supervised setting equipped to treat possible anaphylaxis. However, recognizing that allergy experts may not be available, the recommendations in this section could be enacted by generalists if necessary, although large-scale outcomes of outpatient challenges performed in primary care or emergency department settings have not been published, so clinical judgement is essential.</p><p>An approach to antibiotic use in penicillin-allergic hospitalized patients at low risk for serious reaction, with or without access to allergy consultation, is presented separately.

Note that these studies were carried out in speciality allergy centers, and the safety of this approach in a primary care or urgent care setting has not been examined.</p><p>The largest study included 818 young children (one to four years of age) consecutively referred to an allergy clinic for past cutaneous reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, most commonly given for acute otitis media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. No children had past reactions that were consistent with anaphylaxis, although mild immediate reactions were not excluded. Children were excluded from the study if their past reaction had any features suggestive of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). More than one-half had reacted during their first exposure to amoxicillin, making IgE-mediated reactions unlikely, since these require previous exposure to generate drug-specific IgE. All eligible children underwent monitored challenge with oral amoxicillin without preceding skin testing to assess the safety of this approach. The amoxicillin challenge was given as two doses: the first consisting of 10 percent of a weight-based therapeutic dose, followed by 20 minutes of observation. If no symptoms developed, the child was given the other 90 percent of the dose and observed for at least one hour. The challenge elicited no symptoms in 94 percent, immediate reactions (within 1 hour) in 2 percent (all were isolated urticaria), and delayed reactions in 3.8 percent (median time 12 hours, range 5 to 26 hours: maculopapular rashes, sometimes with angioedema, and one serum sickness-like reaction). In addition, follow-up was available on a subset of 55 children who had no reaction to the amoxicillin challenge to determine if they tolerated subsequent full courses of amoxicillin. Subsequent courses were tolerated in 49 of 55 children, while 6 had delayed cutaneous reactions.</p><p>Additional studies evaluated the utility of penicillin skin testing in children with convincing histories of delayed reactions and concluded that it was not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/12,14,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,25</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 88 children (aged 0.5 to 14 years) with delayed urticarial or maculopapular rashes on beta-lactam antibiotics (mostly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>), the authors concluded that allergy testing was not helpful and that if the initial reaction was limited to cutaneous findings, well-documented, and reviewed by an experienced allergist, a one-step challenge procedure was a safe and effective approach. In these 88 children, reactions occurred in just 7 percent of children given the same medication two months after the initial reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The protocol involved intradermal skin testing with immediate reading, which was positive in 12.5 percent of patients. This was followed by a one-step challenge (150 percent of full dose) for children with negative skin tests or a two-step challenge (50 percent, then 100 percent) for children with positive skin tests. All patients then continued standard doses of the penicillin for 48 hours at home. Of the 88 children challenged, only 7 percent reacted again when given the same antibiotic. The reactions were all mild and similar to the original reactions, with one occurring in 30 minutes and the others after 8 to 12 hours. Four of these six reactors had positive skin tests. Patch testing and delayed reading of intradermal skin tests, which are other testing methods that have been investigated for the diagnosis of nonimmediate drug reactions, were also performed and were negative in all 88 patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of children evaluated the reaction rate if the challenge was extended for five days, which is essentially a subsequent course of the drug given when the patient was well, and found that 11 percent of children had recurrent reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The study population consisted of 152 children who were referred to an allergy clinic for past delayed reactions to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>. Reaction types were maculopapular eruption (46 percent), urticaria (36 percent), urticaria and angioedema (12 percent), and undefined rash (6 percent). Skin testing was performed with amoxicillin, although regardless of the results of skin testing, all patients were offered a five-day challenge and 141 accepted. In total, 16 of 141 children (11 percent) had recurrent reactions similar to those they initially experienced. Five reacted on day 1, five on day 2, and four on day 5. All reactions were mild.</p><p/><p>It would be helpful to have a validated set of questions that could be asked at the point of care to determine if a child's past reaction was sufficiently low-risk that a penicillin could be used again, but this is not available. In a study of children presenting to an urban emergency department with histories of past penicillin reactions, nearly 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">parents/caregivers</span> completed questionnaires about the children's past reactions, and 434 children were deemed low-risk for true allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The questionnaire included hives as a low-risk feature but considered facial angioedema as a high-risk feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. After chart review and discussion with the child's primary care provider, 302 were eligible for allergy evaluation, but only 100 underwent penicillin skin testing. Thus, these 100 patients may not have been representative of the original 434. Ninety-seven had negative skin tests and then passed an oral challenge with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>. Three children had positive skin tests and were later retested and challenged, because skin tests had reverted to negative. Ultimately, all 100 children passed oral challenge to amoxicillin with the passage of time. The results of this study are helpful, but we consider both hives and angioedema to be high-risk features and would not advocate this approach until much larger numbers of patients have been evaluated. Data from other studies has shown that even among children with histories of mild adverse reactions, a few percentage will have positive penicillin skin tests and thus be at risk for acute allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3690921601\"><span class=\"h4\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taken together, the studies above demonstrate that children with low-risk, delayed cutaneous reactions can be safely challenged with penicillins in outpatient allergy clinic settings. We would classify a child's cutaneous reaction as <strong>low risk</strong> if the clinician performed a detailed history and all of the following were true of the past reaction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial signs and symptoms were either observed directly by the clinician or well-documented in the medical record</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reaction was limited to the skin and consisted of maculopapular rash (most common)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reaction occurred days into the antibiotic course (as compared with hours after the first dose)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It did not involve the mucous membranes or blistering or peeling of the skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It did not involve joint swelling or fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It did not require systemic glucocorticoids to control symptoms (since this could indicate a more severe reaction)</p><p/><p>In children with delayed reactions consisting of isolated hives or angioedema without other features of anaphylaxis, graded challenge appears to be safe based on the studies above, although we advocate a more cautious approach. We suggest referral to an allergist when possible, because published challenge protocols have largely been performed by drug allergy specialists. Although the allergy literature is evolving toward more widespread use of graded challenges without skin testing for delayed reactions, many allergists still perform skin testing in such children. If negative, the children can be challenged under observation. If positive, a graded challenge could still be considered depending on the importance of reintroducing penicillins.</p><p>If an allergy consultation is not possible, then the generalist can either use a nonpenicillin (which is safer but may have other disadvantages) or perform a graded challenge to the desired penicillin in an appropriate setting.

In one study that included both children and adults, 642 patients (two-thirds of whom were children) whose histories were either unclear (ie, unsure if past reaction was immediate or delayed) or suggestive of a delayed reaction, were evaluated to determine if skin testing was useful in predicting outcomes of challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-allergy-delayed-hypersensitivity-reactions/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. All patients underwent intradermal testing (without prior epicutaneous testing) and 617 agreed to a graded challenge, regardless of the testing result. Nine patients (1.5 percent) developed mild immediate cutaneous reactions to the full dose, and 4 percent developed later day 1 reactions, which did not correlate with skin test results. Of the 491 patients who agreed to continue penicillins for an extended five-day challenge, 6 percent had mild reactions (mild rashes, pruritus or abdominal discomfort). Thus, in this study, which used clinical histories taken by allergy specialists, skin testing did not appear to be helpful, and no serious reactions occurred.</p><p>Until additional data are available, we have a more cautious approach in adults, for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults who reacted to penicillins as adults, the association with common respiratory viral infections is not as well-characterized as it is in children.
