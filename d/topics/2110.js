Other related eyelid conditions are discussed separately, as is dry eye disease, which is a frequent complication of blepharitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eyelid-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eyelid lesions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology and pathophysiology of blepharitis differ somewhat based on the type (posterior versus anterior). However, there is considerable overlap between these categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F114035\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114035 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posterior blepharitis</strong> &ndash; Posterior blepharitis, the more common type, is characterized by inflammation of the inner portion of the eyelid at the level of the Meibomian glands (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61924 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Meibomian glands are modified sebaceous glands located within the tarsal plates of the eyelids responsible for secretion of the oily layer of the tear film. This oily layer prevents tear evaporation, reduces the surface tension of the tear layer, and facilitates the spread of tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is critical for normal eye lubrication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hyperkeratinization of the meibomian gland ductal epithelium is an early finding in patients with posterior blepharitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Altered lipid composition in gland secretions leads to instability of the tear film [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>]. The abnormal secretions also have a direct toxic effect on the ocular surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. Additionally, the altered lipid composition provides an environment that promotes bacterial growth, which perpetuates the Meibomian gland abnormalities. Long-term inflammation leads to gland dysfunction and fibrosis as well as damage to the eyelid and ocular surface.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chronic inflammatory skin conditions such as rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis may cause posterior blepharitis, but it also commonly occurs in their absence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/3,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,14</a>]. Blepharitis in patients with underlying chronic dermatoses tends to be more severe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seborrheic-dermatitis-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seborrheic dermatitis in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chronic infection may also play a role in posterior blepharitis, although it is less well-studied than in anterior blepharitis. The bacteria that comprise the lid and conjunctival flora in posterior blepharitis are the same as those on normal skin but present in greater numbers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. They include coagulase-negative staphylococci, <em>Corynebacterium</em> species, and <em>Cutibacterium acnes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/5,6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,16</a>]. Bacterial lipase produced by colonizing bacteria on the ocular surface may contribute to the differences in lipid composition in the tear film in patients with blepharitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/3,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anterior blepharitis</strong> &ndash; Anterior blepharitis is less common than posterior blepharitis and characterized by inflammation at the base of the eyelashes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64540 \">picture 2</a>). Patients with anterior blepharitis are more often female and tend to be younger than those with posterior blepharitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The pathophysiology of anterior blepharitis is not completely understood, although lid-colonizing staphylococcal bacteria appear to play a role in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Anterior blepharitis can be further categorized as staphylococcal or seborrheic type:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Staphylococcal type is characterized by fibrinous scales and crust around the eyelashes caused by colonization of the eyelids by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and coagulase-negative staphylococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/15-17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17,19</a>]. Staphylococci may alter Meibomian gland secretion and cause blepharitis via various mechanisms, including direct infection of the lids, production of staphylococcal exotoxin, and provoking an allergic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/12,15-17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15-17,19</a>]. It is likely that a combination of these factors is responsible for the manifestations of anterior blepharitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seborrheic type is characterized by dandruff-like skin changes and greasy scales around the base of the eyelids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Other possible causes of blepharitis include contact (allergic) dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis. Contact blepharitis is an acute inflammatory reaction of the skin of the eyelids, usually occurring as a reaction to an irritant (eg, cosmetics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p><em>Demodex folliculorum</em> is a parasite that has been identified in 30 percent of patients with chronic anterior blepharitis but is also found with approximately the same prevalence in asymptomatic persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, it is clearly a contributing factor in some patients as evidenced by the improvement seen in response to eradicative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A second species, <em>Demodex brevis</em>, has been associated with posterior blepharitis.</p><p>Factors that may provoke or exacerbate blepharitis symptoms include allergic conjunctivitis, cigarette smoking, contact lens use, and retinoid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1303428113\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with blepharitis generally present with chronic recurrent symptoms, which may vary over time, involving both eyes.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Blepharitis is more common in adults than children, and its prevalence increases with age. Children can have dramatic episodes of anterior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior blepharitis, often characterized by more conjunctival and corneal findings than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Blepharitis related to <em>Demodex</em> infestation characteristically presents with cylindrical dandruff or &ldquo;sleeves&rdquo; on the eyelashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Contact (allergic) blepharitis from an irritant (eg, cosmetics) manifests with red, swollen, and itchy eyelids occurring acutely after exposure.</p><p>Symptoms of an associated chronic inflammatory skin condition may also be noted (eg, facial redness or flushing suggestive of rosacea; itchy and flaking skin involving the scalp, external ear, central face, or trunk suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis).

The eyelids, conjunctivae, tear film, and cornea can be examined more closely with a slit lamp; however, it is generally not necessary to establish the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3963512574\"><span class=\"h3\">Eyelids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eyelid edges in patients with blepharitis often appear pink or irritated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61924 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64540 \">picture 2</a>). Crusting of the lashes or lid margins may also be visible. </p><p>Patients with anterior blepharitis typically have adherent material around their eyelashes. In the seborrheic variant of anterior blepharitis, there are often greasy-appearing flakes; whereas in the staphylococcal variant, a hard cylindrical crust develops around the eyelash (called a &quot;collarette&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In posterior blepharitis, it is common to see enlargement of the meibomian gland openings and plugging with thickened, waxy secretions appearing as white or yellow mounds at the gland opening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53663\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53663 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>The eyelashes should be carefully evaluated as chronic inflammation can lead to trichiasis (misdirected eyelashes), madarosis (loss of lashes), poliosis (loss of pigmentation of lashes), or distichiasis (abnormal growth of eyelashes from Meibomian gland orifices). Chronic inflammation can lead to structural changes resulting in entropion (inward turning of eyelid) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63579\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63579 \">picture 5</a>) or ectropion (outward turning of eyelid) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72737\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72737 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p>Other findings that are suggestive of chronic inflammation include neovascularization and dilation of blood vessels of the lid margins, thickening of the lid skin, irregularity of the lid contour, and ulcerations along the lid margin. These findings can be observed with a penlight but are more easily appreciated with slit-lamp magnification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3148840291\"><span class=\"h3\">Conjunctivae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse conjunctival injection is a common but nonspecific finding in patients with blepharitis. Injection may be more prominent on the palpebral conjunctiva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Blepharitis can also be associated with a papillary conjunctival reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76072\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76072 \">picture 7</a>), which appears as raised but flat-toped nodules with central vessels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H930708393\"><span class=\"h3\">Tear film</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tear film irregularities are suggested by the presence of debris <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a foamy appearance on slit-lamp exam. Tear film stability can be formally assessed by measuring the tear break-up time or tear evaporation rate.</p><p>Tear break-up time is performed by examining the tear film with a slit lamp using blue light after instilling <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> stain in the eye. A healthy tear film appears as a green sheen that remains stable for at least 10 seconds. An abnormal tear film becomes irregular or breaks up in less than 10 seconds.</p><p>The tear evaporation rate, which is more often used in research than clinical practice, also assesses the tear film stability and is measured with advanced imaging instruments that use interferometry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1494375162\"><span class=\"h3\">Cornea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corneal abnormalities are infrequent complications of blepharitis. They are best seen with a slit lamp and may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erosions &ndash; Corneal erosions are most commonly found where the inflamed lid margins cross the cornea at the two, four, eight, and ten o'clock positions. Punctate epithelial erosions may appear in the inferior third of the cornea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similar erosions may be associated with dry eyes, but in that condition they are more commonly distributed throughout the interpalpebral space. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltrates &ndash; Marginal corneal infiltrates may occur as a hypersensitivity reaction to staphylococcal antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These appear as an area of superficial whitening near the limbus (border of the cornea and sclera). An area of clear cornea between the limbus and the infiltrate is characteristic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodules &ndash; Corneal nodules (phlyctenules) develop near the limbus and then spread onto the cornea, carrying behind them a leash of vessels. They are considered to be another form of hypersensitivity reaction to staphylococcal antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcers &ndash; Rarely, corneal marginal ulcers can develop in the setting of blepharitis. These must be recognized and treated appropriately to avoid progression to corneal perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scarring &ndash; Chronic irritation and recurrent corneal infiltrates can lead to scarring and development of a superficial corneal pannus (&ldquo;pseudo-pterygium&rdquo;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81259\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81259 \">picture 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2825464887\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ancillary testing (eg, bacterial culture, microscopic examination of the eyelash, imaging techniques [meibography]), are not necessary to establish the diagnosis of blepharitis but may have a role in some clinical settings. Culture of the eyelid margins has limited utility because of the difficulty in distinguishing bacterial infection from colonization. However, it may be useful in patients with severe blepharitis and in those who are not responding to empiric therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Epilation of the eyelashes for microscopic examination to detect <em>Demodex</em> mites is warranted when the clinical presentation (eg, presence of cylindrical dandruff or &ldquo;sleeves&rdquo; on the eyelashes) is suggestive of this diagnosis or when there is severe or refractory blepharitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is performed by the ophthalmologist placing the eyelashes on a glass slide and examining under a cover slip after a drop of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> has been added.</p><p>Techniques of imaging and measuring the meibomian gland size and function, ocular surface, and tear film dynamics are available and can provide more objective measures of the eyelids and tear function in patients with blepharitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. However, these are not routinely used in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blepharitis is a clinical diagnosis based on characteristic findings of redness and irritation of the eyelid margin associated with crusting or flakes on the lashes or lid margins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61924 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64540 \">picture 2</a>). Slit lamp allows for more detailed examination of the meibomian glands, which can help distinguish between posterior and anterior blepharitis. However, it is generally not necessary to make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1784841514\" class=\"local\">'Eye examination'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis of blepharitis can be made by the primary care practitioner in most instances. If the diagnosis is unclear based upon clinical findings, referral to an ophthalmologist for slit-lamp exam (if not available in primary care site) is advised.

It results from a granulomatous inflammatory reaction to the lipid content of the blocked lid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Treatment involves application of warm, moist compresses four times a day.

The goal is to alleviate symptoms and to develop a maintenance regimen to prevent or minimize future exacerbations. Our management approach is based on clinical experience, limited clinical trial and observational data, and consensus expert opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/24,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,39</a>].</p><p>Patients with mild to moderate symptoms can generally be managed with symptomatic measures, including warm compresses, lid massage, lid washing, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>. Patients with severe or refractory symptoms may require additional therapies such as topical or oral antibiotics, topical glucocorticoids, or typical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. All patients should be advised to eliminate or limit potential triggers or exacerbating factors (eg, allergens, cigarette smoking, contact lenses).

These patients can generally be managed by the primary care practitioner.</p><p>Blepharitis is a chronic condition that requires long-term management. The intensity level of treatment varies based on patient symptoms. Most patients with mild to moderate symptoms respond well to the basic interventions described below.</p><p>The efficacy of lid hygiene measures for symptom relief in patients with chronic posterior or anterior blepharitis has been demonstrated in several small clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Warm compresses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Application of heat to the lids and Meibomian glands can liquefy the abnormal solidified secretions by heating them above their melting point. Heat may also promote increased circulation in the Meibomian glands and thereby increase the quantity of secretions.</p><p>Patients should be advised to soak a wash cloth in warm (not scalding) water and place it over the eyes. As the wash cloth cools, it should be rewarmed and replaced for a total of 5 to 10 minutes of soaking time. This is recommended two to four times a day as long as the patient has symptoms and at a decreased frequency in the maintenance phase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Lid massage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lid massage may help empty the Meibomian glands and improve secretion, especially in patients with posterior blepharitis and Meibomian gland inspissation. Lid massage should be performed immediately following application of a warm compress. Either the wash cloth that was used for the compress or a clean fingertip should be used to gently massage the edge of the eyelid towards the eye with a gentle circular motion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Lid washing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with accumulation of debris on the eyelashes may benefit from gentle washing of the eyelid margins following the use of a warm compress. Either warm water or very dilute baby shampoo can be placed on a clean wash cloth, gauze pad, or cotton swab. The patient should then be advised to gently clean along the lashes and lid margin to remove the accumulated material with care to avoid contacting the ocular surface. If shampoo is used, thorough rising is recommended. Vigorous washing should be avoided, as it may cause more irritation. Commercially available eyelid scrub solutions are safe and effective and may be preferred for convenience and ease of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1053971314\"><span class=\"h3\">Artificial tears</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients often need to use supplemental artificial tear eye drops to treat the dryness associated with blepharitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;</a>).

Because of the potential for systemic side effects with oral drugs, topical therapy is usually tried first. Patients with severe or refractory symptoms should be referred to an ophthalmologist. Treatment options for patients with poor response to standard management include topical glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. These agents should be only be prescribed by or in consultation with an ophthalmologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest topical antibiotic therapy for patients who do not respond to the symptomatic measures described above. The threshold for using topical antibiotics is lower in patients with blepharitis who are undergoing eye surgery. The rationale in this setting is that reducing bacterial colonization of the eyelids may prevent postoperative complications such as endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Topical antibiotic ointments (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bacitracin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>) may improve symptoms by reducing the bacterial load of the lashes and conjunctivae. These agents tend to be more effective in anterior blepharitis; however, as previously described, there is considerable overlap between anterior and posterior blepharitis and patients with posterior blepharitis may also respond. Both bacitracin and erythromycin have broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and are generally well tolerated. Antibiotic ointment is placed directly onto the lid margin once daily at bedtime. Once symptoms improve (generally one to two weeks), treatment can be stopped, but lid hygiene measures should be continued. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Lid washing'</a> above.)</p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> ophthalmic solution 1% is an alternative agent particularly for patients with posterior blepharitis. Azithromycin has been shown to improve Meibomian gland secretions and to decrease eyelid redness compared with warm compresses alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials of patients with chronic posterior or anterior blepharitis found that topical antibiotics were effective in providing symptomatic relief and in eradicating bacteria at the lid margin in patients with anterior blepharitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Additional studies have suggested that antibiotics may have a direct effect on improving Meibomian gland function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>), are generally reserved for patients with chronic moderate to severe blepharitis that have an inadequate response to topical antibiotic therapy. Treatment is initiated with doxycycline 100 mg or tetracycline 1000 mg daily in divided doses and tapered after improvement (usually two to four weeks) to doxycycline 50 mg or tetracycline 250 to 500 mg once a day. An alternative regimen is azithromycin 500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg for four more days.</p><p>Evidence supporting the use of oral antibiotics to treat blepharitis is based on mainly observational studies. A systematic review identified eight studies (two randomized trials and six observational studies) evaluating the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> for patients with posterior blepharitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Most of the studies were small (five included &le;20 patients), and each used a different treatment regimen. All of the studies suggested a benefit for oral antibiotics in the management of posterior blepharitis. Another systematic review found that the evidence for efficacy of oral antibiotics was inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Tetracyclines effectively reduce the load of colonizing lid and conjunctival bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. They also decrease keratinization and bacterial lipase production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. Tetracyclines may be especially useful in patients with ocular manifestations of rosacea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, they are associated with reduction of matrix metalloproteinase activity that may play a role in chronic blepharitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Tetracyclines may cause photosensitization, gastrointestinal side effects, and pseudotumor cerebri, as well as interfere with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. They are contraindicated in pregnant or nursing women and in children under 12 years of age. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Erythromycin</a> or another macrolide should be used in these settings.

Topical glucocorticoids should only be prescribed by or in consultation with an ophthalmologist. Treatment should be limited to two to three weeks to reduce the risk for cataract formation or glaucoma. If topical glucocorticoids are prescribed, patients should be reevaluated in a few weeks to measure intraocular pressure and to determine response to treatment.</p><p>Small clinical trials demonstrated short-term improvements in symptoms scores, clinical findings (eg, lid margin injection, tear break-up time, Meibomian gland expressibility), and tear cytokine levels in patients treated with topical glucocorticoids compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology and pathophysiology of blepharitis differ somewhat based on the type (posterior versus anterior) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F114035\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114035 \">table 1</a>). However, there is considerable overlap between these categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blepharitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Posterior blepharitis, the more common condition, is characterized by inflammation of the inner portion of the eyelid at the level of the Meibomian glands (modified sebaceous glands located within the tarsal plates of the eyelids), which are dysfunctional (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61924 \">picture 1</a>). It can be associated with rosacea or seborrheic dermatitis. Anterior blepharitis is characterized by inflammation at the base of the eyelashes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64540 \">picture 2</a>). It can be associated with staphylococcal colonization or seborrhea. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with blepharitis generally present with symptoms of chronic irritation involving both eyes. These include red, swollen, or itchy eyelids; gritty or burning sensation; &ldquo;pink eyes&rdquo;; excessive tearing (which can paradoxically be a sign of dry eye); crusting or matting of eyelashes in the morning; flaking or scaling of the eyelid skin; light sensitivity; and blurred vision (transient in nature, usually improves with blinking). The eyelid edges often appear pink or irritated. Crusting of the lashes or lid margins may also be visible. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blepharitis is a clinical diagnosis based on characteristic findings of redness and irritation of the eyelid margin associated with crusting or flakes on the lashes or lid margins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61924 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64540 \">picture 2</a>). Slit lamp allows for more detailed examination of the meibomian glands, which can help distinguish between posterior and anterior blepharitis. However, it is generally not necessary to make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for blepharitis includes other conditions associated with redness and discomfort of the eyelid such as conjunctivitis, hordeolum (stye), chalazion, and eyelid malignancy. Blepharitis is distinguished from these conditions based upon the history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H1678461383\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for referral to an ophthalmologist include severe eye redness or pain, light sensitivity, impaired vision, corneal abnormalities (eg, erosions, ulcers, scarring), uncertain diagnosis or concern for malignancy, or severe or refractory symptoms.

In addition, patients should be advised to eliminate or limit potential triggers or exacerbating factors (eg, allergens, cigarette smoking, contact lenses). The goal is to alleviate symptoms and to develop a maintenance regimen to prevent or minimize future exacerbations. Blepharitis is a chronic condition that requires long-term management.
