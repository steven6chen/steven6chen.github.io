Lymphedema can be primary (congenital lymphedema, lymphedema praecox, lymphedema tarda) or more commonly secondary (ie, acquired) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64677 \">table 1</a>). The main underlying causes of secondary lymphedema include interruption of lymphatics by surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy (RT), malignant obstruction of the lymphatics, and infection. Lymph node dissection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation of the axilla or groin region for breast cancer or melanoma are the most common causes of secondary lymphedema in developed countries, while filariasis is the most common cause of secondary lymphedema worldwide.</p><p>Conservative, multimodal therapy for lymphedema consists of general measures for monitoring and self-care, which are applicable to all stages of lymphedema, along with varying levels of compression therapy and physiotherapy, with the choice of specific management dependent upon the clinical stage of disease (mild, moderate, severe).</p><p>Conservative therapies for managing lymphedema based upon its clinical severity are reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of lymphedema, and surgical treatment of lymphedema are discussed separately.

ISL staging ranges from 0 to III, and involves two criteria: the &quot;softness&quot; or &quot;firmness&quot; of the limb (reflecting fibrotic soft tissue changes) and the outcome after elevation. Within stages I through III, severity based upon volume differences is assessed as mild (&lt;20 percent increase), moderate (20 to 40 percent increase), or severe (&gt;40 percent increase). Stage &quot;0&quot; lymphedema is a subclinical or latent condition where swelling is not evident despite impaired lymphatic transport.</p><p>Several other classification systems are also used to describe the severity of lymphedema, including those of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) and the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These schemes generally only refer to the physical condition of the extremity.

Within each stage, severity based upon volume differences are assessed as mild (&lt;20 percent increase), moderate (20 to 40 percent increase), or severe (&gt;40 percent increase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

This reflects the evolution of dermal fibrosis. As the fibrosis progresses, the limb may no longer pit on examination. This is sometimes called spontaneously irreversible lymphedema. Stage II corresponds roughly to a moderate grade of lymphedema above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III &ndash; Stage III lymphedema is characterized by lymphostatic elephantiasis. On exam, pitting can be absent, and the skin will have trophic skin changes such as fat deposits, acanthosis, and warty overgrowths (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63928\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63928 \">picture 3</a>).

Lymphedema is often difficult to treat, particularly if progression to later stages has already occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Left untreated, lymphedema tends to gradually progress over time and inhibits the activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Lifelong care, in combination with psychosocial support, is necessary to achieve optimal outcomes. The mainstay of treatment is conservative, typical multimodal therapy, which is aimed at improving patient comfort and reducing limb volume, since the underlying disease cause cannot usually be corrected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Conservative treatments are best administered in clinics with expertise in the treatment of lymphedema. A limited number of patients who fail conservative treatment options may be candidates for surgical therapy, which may include lymphatic surgery, or soft tissue reduction. (See <a href=\"#H182332321\" class=\"local\">'Surgical referral'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of primary and secondary lymphedema&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Conservative, multimodal therapy consists of general measures for self-care (eg, monitoring, skin care, weight reduction), which are applicable to all stages of lymphedema, along with varying levels of compression therapy (compression bandaging, compression garments, intermittent pneumatic compression) and physiotherapy (manual lymphatic drainage, complete decongestive therapy), with the choice of specific intervention depending upon the stage of disease (mild, moderate, severe) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7-9</a>]. It is important to note that there is limited and predominantly low-quality evidence to support any of the treatment options discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3,7,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8,10</a>]. For moderate-to-severe lymphedema, we agree with the consensus statement from the ISL and others that recommend complete decongestive therapy, as a multimodality regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>] (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H517756795\" class=\"local\">'Compression therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H517751907\" class=\"local\">'Physiotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General measures for self-care are aimed at minimizing the degree of edema and slowing the rate of progression.

However, elevation alone is not an effective long-term therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients should avoid positioning the limb in a gravity-dependent position for prolonged time periods; this includes prolonged standing, sitting, or crossing legs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517753391\"><span class=\"h3\">Diet and exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance of ideal body weight should be encouraged. Besides being a contributory factor for the development of lymphedema, obesity may also limit the effectiveness of compression pumps or sleeves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Exercise and weight training are generally safe and should be allowed, with a properly fitted compression garment worn during exercise. In a small trial, 21 patients with breast-cancer-related lymphedema were randomly assigned to dietary advice for weight reduction or to receive a booklet on general healthy eating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At the end of the 12-week study, the weight reduction group experienced a significant reduction in body weight, body mass index, and excess arm volume compared with the control group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H802872652\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Obesity'</a>.)</p><p>Following axillary or groin lymph node dissection, exercise is safe and exercises are generally recommended to restore the full range of motion in the affected extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3,10,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,14-17</a>]. A small study of patients with lower extremity lymphedema following cancer surgery found no significant difference between limb volume differences before and after lower extremity weight training (ie, volume not exacerbated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A systematic review also found evidence that progressive resistance exercise therapy does not appear to increase the risk of developing lymphedema following breast surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, in contrast to early studies which did not recommend exercise during the immediate recovery phase of lymph node surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy (because of concerns that the increase in blood flow may worsen the edema) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], this later review did not find any evidence to suggest a higher risk of lymphedema when starting shoulder mobilizing exercises early after breast surgery compared with a more delayed start (ie, seven days after surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>For patients with established lymphedema, participation in sports involving repetitive movements against resistance, such as rowing, tennis, or golf, has traditionally been discouraged. However, there is accumulating evidence from randomized trials of the safety of exercise and weight training in the affected limb and of other benefits associated with exercise, such as improvements in cardiovascular fitness and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/16,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-22</a>]. One trial compared twice-weekly progressive weight lifting to no lifting over a one-year period (supervised for the first 13 weeks) in 141 breast cancer survivors with stable lymphedema of the arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Weight lifting reduced the number and severity of arm and hand symptoms, increased muscular strength, and significantly reduced the incidence of lymphedema exacerbations (14 versus 29 percent). For patients with lower extremity lymphedema, weight training did not affect limb volume at five months, but bench press and leg press strength increased, and there were improvements in walking distance; however, no improvement was seen in quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/position.papers/Exercise.pdf&amp;token=vZ4mkghkC0rBMio/eTe/Xpm//Ptc/83nhYBkG1ye+ReZl1ukqDsC/7mk4dWH309tlk4CktA/LTWfZA3sKQD1/wGe57+DfOzmqYRhjYy9qZ8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=738\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Lymphedema Network</a> position statement for exercise recommends that individuals with lymphedema wear a properly fitted compression garment during exercise, including aerobic and resistive training, while individuals at risk for developing lymphedema may consider obtaining a compression garment.

Patients should be encouraged to use skin moisturizers and topical antibiotic solutions after small breaks in the skin as may be induced by a paper cut or abrasions, pinpricks, insect bites, or pet scratches. Exposed skin should be protected, including use of sunscreen and wearing of gloves while doing activities that may cause skin injury. Similarly, whenever possible, patients should avoid medical procedures in the affected limb that might introduce infection, such as vaccination, acupuncture, phlebotomy, intravenous lines, and venography. The patient should also avoid exposure to temperature extremes, which may increase the risk of injury to the tissue in the lymphedematous limb. In addition, lymphedema may be exacerbated in patients who use saunas, steam baths, or hot tubs.</p><p>All episodes of cellulitis should be treated. Antibiotics that have adequate coverage for gram-positive cocci should be promptly administered for cellulitis. Severe cellulitis, lymphangitis, or bacteremia requires intravenous antibiotics. If patients experience three or more episodes of cellulitis in a year, we suggest an extended period of oral antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517755804\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoid limb constriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations to avoid limb constriction (eg, tight fitting clothing, blood pressure cuffs) are pervasive, but are based on limited scientific evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Those who support limb constriction as a risk factor for developing lymphedema hypothesize that constriction (no matter how brief) can increase pressure in the limb increasing lymph production, and potentially leading to stenosis and fibrosis of the lymphatic vessels. On the other hand, others have challenged recommendations to avoid limb constriction, observing that limb compression is commonly used in the management of lymphedema.</p><p>For patients with lymphedema or significant risk factors for its development (eg, axillary node dissection), we support a recommendation to measure blood pressure in the contralateral arm, particularly in any setting in which blood pressure is<strong> </strong>being closely monitored (eg, in an intensive care unit, recovery room, or during procedures). This recommendation is based upon several factors. Blood pressure measurement in an enlarged extremity will be inaccurate if the cuff is not properly sized, and the cuff causes a high-pressure focal compression (in contrast to pneumatic compression devices used for lymphedema treatment, for which the compression is applied sequentially) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Among the rare patients who have undergone bilateral axillary lymph node dissection, routine blood pressure measurements can be obtained in the lower extremity. If the patient has had bilateral axillary lymph node dissection and there is not an option of obtaining blood pressure measurements in the lower extremity, then a manual (but not automatic) blood pressure cuff can be used intermittently, but inflated to only just above the expected level of systolic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Leg blood pressure'</a>.) </p><p>Patients who do not have lymphedema, or who have undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy rather than a full axillary lymph node dissection, may have blood pressure measurements taken from either extremity. One study prospectively investigated the association between factors thought to increase the risk for lymphedema in 632 patients treated for breast cancer and screened routinely for lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. On multivariate analysis, there was no significant association between increases in arm volume and blood pressure readings. Significant factors included body mass index &ge;25, axillary lymph node dissection, regional lymph node irradiation, and cellulitis. There was no association between blood pressure readings on the ipsilateral arm and cellulitis.

Patient compliance is required for long-term success. In one study evaluating patients with upper or lower extremity lymphedema, at least 90 percent of the lymphedema reduction was maintained in compliant patients at an average follow-up of nine months, while noncompliant patients lost approximately one-third of the initial benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

However, not all studies have found a benefit for MLD over standard management for reducing limb volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/37,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H517750621\" class=\"local\">'Mild lymphedema'</a> above.)</p><p>However, MLD as a component of multimodal therapy in the form of complete decongestive therapy does appear to reliably reduce limb volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In observational studies, the reduction in limb volume ranged from 33 to 68 percent and was associated with improved pain, cosmesis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/38,39,45-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39,45-50</a>]. In a small phase III trial, 53 patients with lymphedema after breast cancer treatment were randomly assigned to complete decongestive therapy (MLD, multilayer compression bandaging, elevation, remedial exercise, and skin care) versus standard physiotherapy (bandages, elevation, head-neck and shoulder exercises, and skin care) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

In this trial, 95 female breast cancer survivors with lymphedema (defined as an absolute increase in arm volume of at least 10 percent between the affected and unaffected arm) were randomly assigned to complete decongestive therapy or the use of compression garments alone. Compared with compression garment use, complete decongestive therapy resulted in a significantly greater absolute reduction in arm volume (250 versus 142 mL), but the mean reduction in arm volume was not significantly different (29 versus 23 percent). There were no differences in severe adverse events, which consisted of a temporary rash or mild to moderate pain in the affected arm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517750633\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe lymphedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all patients with severe lymphedema (ISL stage III), in addition to general measures, we suggest intensive physiotherapy, usually in the form of complete decongestive therapy, rather than less intense therapy, for those without specific contraindications.

If the lymphedema is controlled and can be reduced with IPC, a compression garment should be worn to maintain limb girth and prevent further swelling. (See <a href=\"#H517757158\" class=\"local\">'Intermittent pneumatic compression'</a> below.) </p><p>In early observational studies examining the benefit of IPC, limb measurements reduced with the use of this then novel device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/4,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,53</a>]. However, an early trial of 80 patients with mild-to-moderate lymphedema found no significant difference in limb circumference comparing pneumatic compression to controls (prophylactic hygiene only) (1.9 versus 0.5 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]</p><p>A number of subsequent studies evaluated the role of intermittent pneumatic compression, in combination with complete decongestive therapy, for moderate-to-severe upper extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/36,40,54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40,54-57</a>] and lower extremity lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/58-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-63</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A benefit was illustrated in a trial of 27 patients with previously untreated lymphedema following treatment for breast cancer who were randomly assigned to complete decongestive therapy alone or with adjunctive IPC (30 minutes daily for 10 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Combined therapy was associated with a significantly greater reduction in limb volume during initial treatment (45 versus 26 percent with complete decongestive therapy alone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A second randomization of the trial evaluated the efficacy of maintenance IPC therapy (self-administered 60 minutes daily) added to complete decongestive therapy in 11 patients with unilateral breast-cancer-associated lymphedema who had previously been treated with a multimodality program of complete decongestive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. At 6 to 12 months, a significant reduction in mean limb volume was found for combined therapy compared with an increased limb volume with complete decongestive therapy alone (-90 versus +33 mL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A benefit for pneumatic compression devices in patients with lymphedema was further supported by a retrospective review of 718 patients with lymphedema (374 with cancer and 344 without cancer) who were commercially insured and Medicare Managed care enrollees from a large national United States managed healthcare insurer and who received an Advanced Pneumatic Compression Device (APCD) between 2007 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Outcomes were compared for the 12 months before and after APCD purchase. Specifics regarding the severity of the lymphedema, whether it was upper or lower extremity, and the other modalities being applied for lymphedema treatment were not provided. In both the cancer and noncancer cohorts, use of an APCD was associated with a significant reduction in the rates of cellulitis (from 21 to 4.5 percent in the cancer cohort, and from 29 to 7 percent in the noncancer cohort), a decrease in the need for lymphedema-related manual therapy (from 59 to 41 percent in the cancer cohort, and from 53 to 31 percent in the noncancer cohort), and an overall reduction in total lymphedema-related costs per patient. </p><p/><p>Thus, intermittent pneumatic compression appears to be an effective addition to a multimodality lymphedema treatment. However, given the logistical problems with application, particularly for patients with lower extremity lymphedema, we tend to reserve this therapy for patients with severe lymphedema. For patients with mild-to-moderate lymphedema, there is little need for IPC; however, it may be used as an adjunct in those with lower stage disease who are unable to perform self-manual drainage or in those with allergies to components of compression garments (eg, latex). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H311940007\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517756795\"><span class=\"h2\">Compression therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517756801\"><span class=\"h3\">Compression bandaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In early stages of lymphedema, external compression is used to diminish ultrafiltration and is achieved with repetitively applied, multilayered padding materials and short-stretch (also called low-stretch) bandages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/6,30,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30,65</a>]. For more severe disease, compression bandaging is applied to the affected limb after manual lymphatic drainage is performed and is worn around the clock during the treatment phase (phase 1) of complete decongestive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H517750338\" class=\"local\">'At risk for postoperative lymphedema'</a> above and <a href=\"#H517750621\" class=\"local\">'Mild lymphedema'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Phases'</a> below.)</p><p>Short-stretch bandages apply pressure during movement, but not at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The pressure induced by muscle contraction within the bandage appears to reduce lymphedema via mechanical stimulation of the smooth muscle of the lymphatic vessels, resulting in increased lymph flow. The multilayered bandage may also soften the edematous tissue, thereby increasing the efficacy of manual lymphatic drainage.</p><p>A possible alternative to standard bandages is kinesio tape (also called K-tape), which is made of a highly elastic woven fabric that stretches only along its longitudinal axis and has been used for rehabilitation after sports injuries. An initial randomized trial of 41 patients with breast cancer and unilateral lymphedema of the arm found equivalent efficacy with K-tape and short-stretch bandages but better patient acceptance of K-tape, manifested by less difficulty in usage and increased comfort and convenience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517756948\"><span class=\"h3\">Compression garments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the lymphedema reaches its nadir, compression garments (lymphedema compression sleeve and gauntlet or hosiery) are used to provide maintenance therapy (phase 2 of complete decongestive therapy) to prevent fluid reaccumulation. (See <a href=\"#H517750627\" class=\"local\">'Moderate lymphedema'</a> above and <a href=\"#H517750633\" class=\"local\">'Severe lymphedema'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Phases'</a> below.)</p><p>Fitted elastic knit two-way low stretch compression garments generate greater pressures distally than proximally, thereby promoting mobilization of the edema fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/6,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,67</a>]. Compression garments deliver 20 to 50+ mmHg of pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. The highest compression tolerated by the patient is likely to be the most beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A prescription is necessary to obtain compression garments, and these garments need to be provided by a fitter with appropriate expertise. For the upper extremity, a compression hand piece, either a glove or a gauntlet, is necessary when wearing a compression sleeve to prevent swelling in the hand. Similarly, in the lower extremity the foot is an integral part of compression hosiery. It is important to note that compression bandages or garments may lead to the onset or progression of lymphedema if they are restrictive or not properly fitted. When correctly fitted and worn properly, compression garments may reduce swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. If off-the-shelf garments do not provide a proper fit, custom-made garments will be necessary. However, as fluid shifts occur, even custom-made garments may no longer fit. Garments should be replaced every three to six months or sooner if they lose elasticity. Use of compression garments during exercise is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H517753391\" class=\"local\">'Diet and exercise'</a> above.)</p><p>Compression garments are typically worn during waking hours, with compression bandaging at night, if necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Nighttime compression garments consist of padding materials with compression applied over the padding with short-stretch bandages, elastic sleeves, or Velcro bandages. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517757158\"><span class=\"h3\">Intermittent pneumatic compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) (also called sequential pneumatic compression) is another method of compression therapy. IPC may be most effective in addition to a multimodality lymphedema treatment. IPC may also be an alternative maintenance program for lymphedema patients that have difficulty in performing self-manual lymphatic drainage secondary to weakness, fatigue, or range of motion deficits. It may also be beneficial for lymphedema patients that are unable to use compression bandaging or garments due to skin allergies from the materials used in these compression products. (See <a href=\"#H517750633\" class=\"local\">'Severe lymphedema'</a> above.)</p><p>These devices employ a plastic sleeve or stocking that is intermittently inflated over the affected limb. Most pneumatic compression pumps sequentially inflate a series of chambers in a distal-to-proximal direction. Some pumps permit adjustment of the amount of pressure in a particular chamber; however, for the management of patients with lymphedema, the ideal pressure for the pump is not known. Some investigators have suggested that a pressure greater than 60 mmHg may injure lymphatic vessels. IPC is usually applied daily or five times per week. The optimal duration of IPC is also unknown. Among the various studies, sessions have varied in length (90 minutes to as long as six hours) and duration (two to three days to four weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/4,30,36,53,54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,30,36,53,54,56</a>]. After external compression therapy is completed, a form-fitting, low-stretch elastic knit sleeve is usually applied to maintain edema reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Light pressure is used to mobilize edema fluid from distal to proximal areas in an attempt to enhance filling of the cutaneous lymph vessels, promote dilation and contractility of lymphatic conduits, and recruit watershed pathways for lymph flow.

Although commonly followed, these contraindications are predominantly based upon theoretical concerns, and there are few clinical data to support them.

In addition, initial bandaging should be done on a limited portion of the involved extremity to evaluate the impact more proximally, which can guide the extent of bandaging in future treatment. Patients and caregivers should be educated to identify dyspnea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal bloating, which may reflect an adverse effect of fluid redistribution. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3767033\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic treatments are not generally used as no drug has yet been shown to be beneficial.

Diuretics are of little benefit in the management of chronic lymphedema and may promote the development of volume depletion. When diuretics are given to treat the usual forms of peripheral edema, the initial fluid loss comes from the intravascular space. The ensuing reduction in venous, and thus intracapillary, pressure allows the edema fluid to be mobilized and the plasma volume to be maintained. However, this sequence does not occur with lymphatic obstruction, since the edema fluid cannot be easily mobilized into the vascular space. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-edema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of edema in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An early report found that coumarin (a warfarin-like drug that might reduce high protein edema by stimulating proteolysis) was beneficial in patients with lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, a larger, carefully performed crossover study of 140 women found no difference between coumarin and placebo in reducing arm volume and relieving symptoms; coumarin was also associated with significant hepatotoxicity in 6 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. A subsequent systematic review concluded that the poor quality of the trials prevented any conclusions from being made about the effectiveness of benzopyrones (including coumarin) in reducing limb volume, pain, or discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experimental therapies </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low-level laser therapy &ndash; Low-level laser therapy (also known as cold laser therapy) is a photochemical treatment used for soft tissue injury, chronic pain, and wound healing. Two small randomized trials in women with postmastectomy lymphedema have shown a reduction in limb volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]; two others failed to show any benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. Among the hypotheses to explain the possible benefits of laser therapy are a potential decrease in fibrosis, stimulation of macrophages and the immune system, and a suggested role in encouraging lymphangiogenesis, which may both stimulate surviving lymphatic pathways and encourage the formation of new pathways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pharmacological therapy &ndash; Preclinical reports have suggested that anti-inflammatory therapies targeting the T cell-mediated inflammatory response may be beneficial in preventing lymphedema after lymphatic injury. In addition, these studies have shown promise in treating lymphedema once it has developed. One study demonstrated that topically applied <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, an inhibitor of T cell proliferation, significantly decreased the development of pathological changes of lymphedema in a mouse model of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Additional research is needed to translate these findings from the bench to the bedside. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182332321\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical referral is appropriate for all patients with lymphedema, particularly those in whom conservative management has failed or if the patient is motivated to pursue additional treatments. Lymphedema may be surgically treated with physiologic interventions designed to restore lymphatic circulation or with excisional procedures that aim to remove the excess subcutaneous adipose deposition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of primary and secondary lymphedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physiologic treatments consist of either lymph node transplantation wherein healthy lymph nodes are harvested from a donor area and microsurgically transplanted to the lymphedematous limb (arterial and venous circulation are reattached) or lymphovenous bypass in which lymph is drained into the venous circulation or into the lymphatic collectors above the area of lymphatic obstruction. </p><p>Lymph node transplantation is a newer surgical procedure with reports of promising outcomes in patients with early-stage lymphedema in early studies. This concept is supported by a systematic review of 18 studies with a total of 305 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Although this systematic review was limited by variability in outcome measures, surgical techniques, and length of follow-up, the majority of patients (&gt;85 percent) had improvements in limb circumference or limb volume after surgery. In addition, 93 percent of respondents were satisfied or highly satisfied with surgical results and the remainder were no better or worse following surgery. More than one-half of patients were able to discontinue the use of compression garments. Finally, among six studies that reported cellulitis as an outcome (106 patients), there was a 90 percent decrease in the incidence of infections following lymph node transplantation. </p><p>Lymphovenous bypass procedures, similar to lymph node transplantation, are also effective in patients with early-stage lymphedema. In a prospective study of 100 consecutive patients, the authors noted that 96 percent of patients with upper extremity lymphedema had symptomatic improvement (lighter, softer, less painful arms) and 74 percent had quantitative reduction in excess volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Some surgeons combine lymph node transplantation and lymphovenous bypass in an effort to maximize results. However, it is important to note that although lymphatic surgery is an evolving field with encouraging results, long-term follow-up and prospective studies are needed. &#160; &#160;</p><p>Excisional procedures for lymphedema aim to remove the fibrofatty tissue that is deposited. These procedures are performed using either liposuction with small cannulas inserted into the subcutaneous space or, less commonly, by radical resection of the excess tissues. Excisional procedures, unlike physiologic treatments, are best used in patients who have failed conservative measures and have substantial subcutaneous fibroadipose tissue deposition (ie, late stage 2 or 3). </p><p>Liposuction is highly effective in the upper extremity (and, to a lesser extent, lower extremity). This procedure is relatively simple to perform and has low rates of complications, such as minor infections and paresthesias. Patients treated in this manner may have substantial (&gt;90 percent) long-term decrease in limb volume and improved quality-of-life if compression garments are worn at all times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. However, liposuction does not cure the underlying disorder, and noncompliance with the use of compression garments results in rapid reaccumulation of fibrofatty tissues, usually within three months. &#160;</p><p>Radical excision of skin and subcutaneous tissues is generally reserved for patients with very severe disease who have failed all other measures. These procedures are particularly useful in areas where liposuction is not possible (eg, scrotal lymphedema). These procedures are much more invasive than liposuction and may result in substantial morbidity. Nevertheless, severe symptoms in some patients justify this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7262159\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP AND OTHER CONCERNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical measurements of girth or estimates of lymphedema volume are necessary to track changes during treatment relative to baseline.

The schedule for follow-up depends upon the severity of lymphedema and treatment regimen.

Although, in theory, lymphedema may be exacerbated at high altitude or during air travel, since the ambient atmosphere pressure is less than the relative outlet transcapillary pressure within the superficial tissues, studies suggest that the risk from air travel of precipitating or worsening lymphedema is very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/6,91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,91-93</a>]. Whether the use of compression sleeves during air flight in women with lymphedema is of benefit is debated. Some suggest that domestic air travel (&lt;4.5 hours) is low risk and that compression devices may be counterproductive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

ISL staging involves two criteria: the &quot;softness&quot; or &quot;firmness&quot; of the limb (reflecting fibrotic soft tissue changes); and the outcome after elevation. Within each stage, severity based upon volume differences are assessed as mild (&lt;20 percent increase), moderate (20 to 40 percent increase), or severe (&gt;40 percent increase).
