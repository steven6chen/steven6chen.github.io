As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biopsy may be deferred if the procedural risk is prohibitive or if the patient is uncooperative or unwilling. In such cases, a presumptive diagnosis can sometimes be made without a biopsy to facilitate the initiation of therapy. However, a biopsy should often be performed at a later date if it becomes feasible (eg, after delivery in a pregnant patient with suspected glomerular disease).

(See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546190780\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOMERULAR ANATOMY AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The glomerulus is the basic filtering unit of the kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F113970\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113970 \">figure 1</a>). Each glomerulus is essentially a tuft of capillaries formed by the branching of the afferent arteriole and supported by a structural matrix called the mesangium, which is maintained by specialized mesangial cells. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) provides both a size- and charge-selective barrier to the passage of circulating macromolecules from the plasma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50018\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50018 \">picture 1</a>). On the urinary side of the GBM is a lining composed of a layer of podocytes, which are specialized epithelial cells possessing a specialized intercellular junction, the slit diaphragm. The slit diaphragm provides another barrier to the filtration of plasma macromolecules. The glomerular capillary tufts are surrounded by the Bowman's capsule, a single layer of parietal epithelial cells forming a cup-like sac that is continuous with the renal tubule, and into which the filtrate from the glomerular capillaries is collected and passed to the renal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>On a pathological basis, glomerular lesions can be diffuse (all glomeruli are involved) or focal (only some glomeruli are involved [typically less than 50 percent]). At the level of the individual glomerulus, a process is global if the whole glomerular tuft is involved or segmental if only a portion is involved (less than 50 percent). Histologic descriptions include the terms &quot;proliferative&quot; (an increase in the number of cells in the glomerulus), &quot;sclerosing&quot; (presence of scarring), and &quot;necrotizing&quot; (areas of cell death). Proliferation may occur predominantly in the mesangium (mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis), within the capillary wall (endocapillary hypercellularity), and in an extracapillary location. Extracapillary proliferation (also known as crescents) are lesions associated with accumulations of macrophages, fibroblasts, proliferating epithelial cells, and fibrin within Bowman's space and represent rupture of the glomerular membrane, signifying severe injury to the glomerular capillary wall. Some examples of how this terminology is used include &quot;focal and segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis&quot; and &quot;diffuse global proliferative glomerulonephritis&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80304\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80304 \">picture 2</a>). Lastly, interstitial fibrosis, which accompanies uncontrolled glomerular disease, is a poor prognostic sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Several mechanisms lead to glomerular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Podocyte dysfunction can occur in genetic disease, affecting key basement membrane proteins such as collagen IV mutations in Alport syndrome. In diseases such as minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), putative circulating factors are thought to directly affect podocyte function and lead to proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In diabetes mellitus and amyloidosis, there is mechanical disruption of the glomerulus due to accumulation of normal or abnormal protein both in the capillary loops of the glomerulus and the mesangium. Immune mechanisms include in situ formation of immune complexes in membranous glomerulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] or the localized effects of anti-GBM antibodies in Goodpasture's disease; in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, immune-mediated kidney injury is caused by deposition of circulating immune complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Lastly, activated neutrophils and macrophages could directly injure the glomerulus in diseases such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of immune injury of the glomerulus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-glomerular-crescent-formation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of glomerular crescent formation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1292164380\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF GLOMERULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations associated with glomerular disease include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria</strong> &ndash; Glomerular disease should be suspected when hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria are seen on urinalysis.

In the nephrotic syndrome, leakage of plasma proteins without inflammation is the primary pathogenic mechanism. Conversely, in glomerulonephritis, inflammation within the glomerulus leads not only to the passage of plasma proteins but also of inflammatory cells (leukocytes) and RBCs into the renal tubule. These classifications, however, are <strong>not</strong> exclusive, as some conditions may present with both patterns, and some disorders (eg, lupus nephritis) may progress from one pattern to the other.

However, if proteinuria is discovered by a quantitative test for urinary protein (ie, a 24-hour urine collection or a random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio), the origin of the proteinuria can be determined with a dipstick, a quantification of urine albumin excretion (ie, a 24-hour urine collection or a random urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio), or with a urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation.
