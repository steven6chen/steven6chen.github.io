It usually happens on the genitals, where it can also cause itching or pain. But it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the breasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F116153\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116153 \">picture 1</a>). It is more common in women than in men.</p><p>Women are most likely to get lichen sclerosus before puberty or after menopause. Puberty is the time in a girl's life when she starts getting periods. Menopause is the time in a woman's life when she stops getting them. But adult women who still have periods can also get lichen sclerosus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9559679\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of lichen sclerosus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women and girls, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching of the vulva &ndash; This is the area around the opening of the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53704 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching, bleeding, or pain around the anus &ndash; This is the opening where bowel movements come out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discomfort or dull pain in the vulva</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid that comes out of the vagina &ndash; Doctors call this &quot;vaginal discharge.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain during sex or urination</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes around the vulva or anus, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>White, wrinkled skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bruises</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cracked skin that sometimes bleeds</p><p/><p>In men, lichen sclerosus is most common in men who are not circumcised. Men who are not circumcised have extra skin over the tip of the penis. The skin is called the &quot;foreskin.&quot; Symptoms in men can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tight foreskin &ndash; It might be hard to pull back for cleaning.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes on the foreskin that look like scars</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A penis that is less sensitive than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful erections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble urinating</p><p/><p>Lichen sclerosus can cause white patches in areas other than the genitals. These can happen in women and men, but children do not usually get them. The patches are most common on the upper body, for example on the breasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F116153\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116153 \">picture 1</a>). People with dark skin might have patches that are darker or lighter than their normal skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9559694\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You or your child has itching, bleeding, or pain in the vulva or penis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have white, light, or dark patches on your skin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9559709\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your symptoms.</p><p>Adults with lichen sclerosus often have a test called a &quot;biopsy.&quot; In this test, a doctor takes a small sample of skin from the area with symptoms. Another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope. It can show if lichen sclerosus or a different condition is causing symptoms. Children do not usually need a biopsy.</p><p>People with lichen sclerosus sometimes have other health conditions. The doctor might do tests for these, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of fluid from the vagina, for women &ndash; These tests can show if there is an infection in the vagina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; These can show signs of other medical conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9559724\"><span class=\"h1\">How is lichen sclerosus treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors cannot get rid of lichen sclerosus that affects the vulva, but they can treat it. It is important for women with this condition to get treatment as soon as possible. Lichen sclerosus that is not treated can make scars form in the vulva. The scars can cause permanent damage.</p><p>Lichen sclerosus treatments for women include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learning how to keep the vulva healthy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58896 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relieve symptoms and keep scars from forming &ndash; These can be an ointment to put on the skin, a shot, or pills taken by mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove scar tissue, if scars have formed.</p><p/><p>Lichen sclerosus treatments for men include medicines and surgery. The most common surgery is called &quot;circumcision.&quot; In this surgery, a doctor removes the foreskin.</p><p>Lichen sclerosus that is not on the vulva or penis might not need treatment. If it bothers you, your doctor or nurse can suggest different treatments to relieve symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9559739\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lichen sclerosus is usually a lifelong condition. Most women with lichen sclerosus on the vulva need to use medicine for years. It is important to follow the directions your doctor or nurse gives you. Do not stop using your medicine unless your doctor or nurse tells you to stop.</p><p>Adults who get lichen sclerosus on the genitals have a higher risk of cancer in the genital area. They should see a doctor or nurse at least 1 or 2 times a year. The doctor will check for cancer and any other changes. Women should check the vulva every month for any changes. A doctor or nurse can show the right way to check.</p><p>Doctors do not think children who get lichen sclerosus have the same cancer risk as adults who get it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9559756\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-itching-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvar itching (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvar pain (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-sclerosus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lichen sclerosus (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
