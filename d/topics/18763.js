VIN refers to squamous lesions, which comprise the great majority of vulvar neoplasia. There is no routine screening for VIN or vulvar carcinoma. </p><p>The terminology, diagnosis, and treatment of VIN are reviewed here. The diagnosis and treatment of vulvar cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-cancer-epidemiology-diagnosis-histopathology-and-treatment-of-rare-histologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar cancer: Epidemiology, diagnosis, histopathology, and treatment of rare histologies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-vulva-staging-and-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: Staging and surgical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2015, International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) published a classification system for vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This topic review will utilize the 2015 ISSVD nomenclature, except when citing studies that used a different terminology system. The World Health Organization (WHO) also issues terminology for vulvar neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The 2015 ISVVD terminology for vulvar intraepithelial lesions is based on a review of previous ISSVD, Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST), and WHO terminology, and addressing of the concerns about the LAST terminology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The ISVVD terminology is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) of the vulva (synonyms include vulvar LSIL, flat condyloma, or human papillomavirus [HPV] effect)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) of the vulva (vulvar HSIL, VIN usual type)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VIN differentiated type (dVIN)</p><p/><p>In 2012, the Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) project of the College of American Pathology and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology published changes in the terminology used to describe HPV-associated squamous lesions of the anogenital tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In the LAST system, VIN 2,3 is referred to as vulvar HSIL. Two concerns about the LAST vulvar terminology were that: (1) it including vulvar LSIL, although this category had been eliminated in the 2004 ISSVD classification; (2) it did not include differentiated type VIN, because it is not associated with HPV, but this type accounts for the majority of VIN cases that progress to invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated vulvar HSIL, formerly called usual VIN, is estimated to be associated with about 20 percent of squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva, whereas differentiated VIN is the putative precursor lesion of about 80 percent of vulvar cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In 2004, VIN had been classified into two main categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VIN, usual type &ndash; Lesions associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). This category includes the former subclassifications of VIN: VIN, warty type; VIN, basaloid type; and VIN, mixed (warty, basaloid) type. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Historically, VIN was categorized as three grades, VIN 1, 2, and 3. There is no evidence that what had been termed VIN 1 is a cancer precursor requiring treatment, and in 2004 the ISSVD recommended that the term VIN be limited to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (formerly termed VIN 2 and VIN 3) for which treatment is indicated to prevent progression to cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Lesions previously referred to as VIN 1 were recommended to be referred to as condyloma acuminatum. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VIN, differentiated type &ndash; Lesions that are not associated with HPV, but are associated with vulvar dermatoses, mainly lichen sclerosus. This category includes the former subclassification VIN, simplex type.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare cases that did not fit into these categories were termed &quot;unclassified type.&quot;</p><p/><p>In 1986, the ISSVD terminology included the categories VIN 1,2,3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275384\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span></p><p>The histopathologic classification of vulvar intraepithelial lesions (VIN) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67918 \">table 1</a>) is regularly updated as our understanding of the clinical and pathologic characteristics of these lesions evolves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3197098459\"><span class=\"h2\">Vulvar LSIL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biologic implications of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) of the vulva, flat condyloma, or human papillomavirus (HPV) are alike; thus, flat condyloma acuminatum is included in the vulvar LSIL category. By contrast, exophytic condyloma acuminatum is not classified as VIN. Vulvar LSIL lesions are benign manifestations of the skin&rsquo;s reaction to an HPV infection; they are often self-limited and should not be considered as potentially neoplastic lesions. This is further emphasized by the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) classification, which uses the term &quot;lesion&quot; rather than &quot;neoplasia&quot; for these low-grade changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Vulvar HSIL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VIN lesions can be subdivided based upon their morphologic and histologic features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67283\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67283 \">picture 1</a>). Although each of these types of VIN exist in pure form, mixtures of warty and basaloid VIN are common and are classified together as vulvar high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (formerly VIN usual type).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The basaloid subtype has a thickened epithelium with a relatively flat, smooth surface. Histologically, it consists of atypical immature parabasal type cells with numerous mitotic figures and enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The warty (condylomatous) subtype is characterized by a surface that is undulating or spiking, giving it a condylomatous appearance. Histologically, it consists of marked cellular proliferation with numerous mitotic figures and abnormal maturation, but may have some maturation (not all basaloid cells).</p><p/><p>Vulvar HSIL is often multifocal. The interlabial grooves, posterior fourchette, and perineum are most frequently affected by multifocal lesions; more extensive disease is often confluent, involving the labia majora, minora, and perianal skin. Confluent or multifocal lesions exist in up to two-thirds of women with VIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Differentiated VIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differentiated VIN comprises less than 5 percent of VIN and typically occurs in postmenopausal women. It is usually unifocal and unicentric and is often associated with lichen sclerosus, but not with HPV infection.</p><p>Differentiated VIN is commonly found adjacent to keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma or in patients with a history of vulvar cancer. The differentiated (simplex) type refers to lesions in which the epithelium is thickened and parakeratotic with elongated and anastomosing rete ridges. The abnormal cells are confined to the parabasal and basal portion of the rete pegs with little or no atypia above the basal or parabasal layers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The basal cells usually stain positively for p53, and p53-positive cells extend above the basal layers into the upper layers of the epidermis. Differentiated VIN is the putative precursor of HPV-negative vulvar cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/6,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,12</a>]. Distinguishing differentiated VIN from reactive squamous proliferations can be quite difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275134\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of both vulvar low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) (formerly vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia [VIN] usual type) is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, as is the corresponding vulvar cancer of the warty and basaloid subtypes. </p><p>Multifocal vulvar HSIL and multicentric vulvar HSIL are most often associated with high-oncogenic-risk HPV subtypes 16, 18, and 31 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>] and should be considered premalignant lesions. By contrast, vulvar condylomata acuminata are usually, but not exclusively, associated with low-oncogenic-risk HPV subtypes 6 and 11. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The anogenital epithelium is derived from the embryonic cloaca and includes the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus, and lower three centimeters of rectal mucosa up to the dentate line. Since the entire region shares the same embryological origin and is susceptible to similar exogenous agents (eg, HPV infection), squamous intraepithelial lesions in this area are often both multifocal (ie, multiple foci of disease within the same organ) and multicentric (ie, foci of disease involving more than one organ). Thus, women with VIN may have synchronous or metachronous squamous neoplasia of other lower genital tract sites (cervix, vagina, anus). There is evidence that some cases of high-grade VIN and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) represent a monoclonal lesion derived from high-grade or malignant cervical neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of differentiated VIN is less well understood than vulvar LSIL or HSIL. It is typically associated with lichen sclerosus. The risk of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in women with lichen sclerosus is approximately 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Differentiated VIN is found adjacent to 80 percent of vulvar squamous cell carcinomas. The diagnosis of solitary differentiated VIN is very challenging and appears to be associated with rapid progression to squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with lichen sclerosus with dyskeratosis and parakeratosis, hyperplasia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> basal cellular atypia tend to have the highest risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma. There are no known biomarkers to reliably identify the patients at highest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-sclerosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen sclerosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H717278783\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a study based on data from a United States national cancer database, in 2000, the incidence of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) 3 was 2.86 per 100,000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The average age at diagnosis is 46 years based upon data from a systematic review of 97 studies including over 3300 women with VIN 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Women younger than 50 years old account for 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. </p><p>Risk factors for <strong>vulvar HSIL</strong> are similar to those for vulvar carcinoma and include human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, cigarette smoking, and immunodeficiency or immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. The degree of increase in risk for each risk factor is not well established.

Approximately 60 percent of women with vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) 3 or VIN have preexisting or synchronous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and close to 10 percent of women with CIN 3 have concomitant squamous intraepithelial neoplasm at other sites (eg, 3 percent have VAIN 3 and 7 percent have VIN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/13,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,28,29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cigarette smoking &ndash; Cigarette smoking has been consistently associated with development of VIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. As an example, one series reported 27 of 40 women with VIN were cigarette smokers compared with 5 of 40 age-matched women with nonneoplastic vulvar disease (68 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The mechanism for the association is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunodeficiency &ndash; VIN is more common in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than in uninfected controls.

The risk of vulvar squamous carcinoma in women with lichen sclerosus is approximately 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There is prospective evidence that earlier detection and proactive management of lichen sclerosus may lead to a reduction in risk of the occurrence of VIN differentiated type (dVIN) or development of squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Dysuria may occur if there is a periurethral VIN lesion or if urine comes into contact with a VIN lesion at another site. A systematic review of 97 studies including over 3300 women with VIN 3 reported that 64 percent presented with pruritus or pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H717279006\"><span class=\"h2\">Vulvar lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 40 percent of women with VIN are asymptomatic and are diagnosed when a lesion is noted by the patient or detected during a routine gynecologic examination or at colposcopy for abnormal cervical cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Risk factors for exposure include sexual contact, including genital, anal, or oral contact to the vulva. Vaginal intercourse is not required to transmit HPV. </p><p>Women should be asked about a prior history of VIN, genital warts, or vulvar cancer, and of other HPV-associated lower genital tract neoplasia, most commonly cervical neoplasia.

The lesions are often raised or verrucous and white (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72661\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72661 \">picture 2</a>), but the color may be red (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74997\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74997 \">picture 3</a>), pink, gray, or brown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75216\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75216 \">picture 4</a>). Macular lesions mostly occur on adjacent mucosal surfaces. There is no pathognomonic clinical appearance, and more than one of these patterns may be seen in the same patient.</p><p>Condylomata acuminata (genital warts) may be difficult to differentiate on examination from VIN. It may also be difficult to distinguish between VIN and invasive vulvar squamous carcinoma, and both may coexist in a patient.</p><p>Other vulvar lesions may mimic VIN, including lichen sclerosus or lichen planus, and condyloma lata. If a lesion is treated without biopsy and does not completely resolve or is refractory to a defined course of empiric therapy, it should be biopsied to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

A vulva with multiple areas of abnormalities warrants multiple biopsies. The appearance of VIN is similar to vulvar carcinoma, Typically, lesions are firm, white, red, or skin-colored papules, nodules, or plaques.

The goals of treatment of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) are to prevent development of vulvar squamous carcinoma and relieve symptoms, while preserving normal vulvar anatomy and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64754861\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of treatment method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the treatment of vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), excisional, ablative, and topical treatment modalities appear comparable in terms of efficacy. The choice of excision versus other treatments for vulvar HSIL depends primarily upon the risk of invasive disease based upon histology and risk factors (see <a href=\"#H659860\" class=\"local\">'Risk of malignancy'</a> below). Other factors that impact treatment are location, extent of disease, and symptoms. </p><p>Vulvar low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) is equivalent to condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts), and treatment is discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vulvar-and-vaginal-warts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vulvar and vaginal warts&quot;</a>).

Based upon the available evidence, the major surgical interventions appear to be similarly effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a literature review of 1905 surgically treated patients, the frequency of recurrence after vulvectomy, partial vulvectomy, local excision, and laser ablation was 19, 18, 22, and 23 percent, respectively, within 12 to 75 months (mean, 39 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, a large single-institution study (n = 303) of women treated for VIN found a higher risk of recurrence after laser ablation compared with excision (41.9 versus 26.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>For women with <strong>vulvar HSIL</strong> who have a lesion that is worrisome for possible invasive disease (eg, a lesion that is raised, ulcerative, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has irregular borders) and those with clinically significant risk factors for invasive disease (previous VIN or vulvar carcinoma, immunosuppression, tobacco use, age &ge;45 years, lichen sclerosus), surgical excision is required. Excision provides both treatment and a diagnostic specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma is present at the time of excision in 10 to 22 percent of women with VIN on initial biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/13,23,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23,38</a>]. Women with lesions that involve the clitoris, urethra, or anus require special attention, because excision may impair function. These women should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for management. (See <a href=\"#H717278783\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>For women with vulvar HSIL without the lesion characteristics or risk factors listed above, the choice of therapy depends upon the location, extent of disease, concern for malignancy, and on patient preference. Excision may be performed, but ablative therapy or topical pharmacologic treatment are the most likely to preserve vulvar anatomy. </p><p>In our practice, for women in whom malignancy is not suspected or has been excluded, we treat with excision for single lesions that allow complete removal with satisfactory cosmetic and functional results. We prefer ablative therapy with laser or argon beam coagulator to excision for those with the following characteristics: young women; multifocal disease; lesions that involve the clitoris, urethra, or anus; and lesions that involve the vaginal introitus (excision in this area may result in dyspareunia). For women with recurrent lesions, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> to avoid multiple excisional procedures that may distort anatomy or result in impairment of function or chronic pain. This is especially relevant in women with risk factors for recurrent disease (eg, heavy smokers, immunocompromised patients). We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> only rarely and as a last resort when other therapies have failed. Based on subsequent evidence, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a> may be a promising alternative topical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>For women with <strong>differentiated VIN</strong>, we recommend surgical excision rather than ablation or pharmacologic therapy. Differentiated VIN is associated with a high risk of developing invasive carcinoma.

Vulvectomy is reserved for women in whom vulvar carcinoma is suspected and who have lesions that are large or multifocal, and cannot be treated with a wide local excision or ablative therapy. (See <a href=\"#H126218\" class=\"local\">'Coexistent VIN and carcinoma at diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Wide local excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wide local excision (defined as excision of an individual lesion with a 1 cm margin) followed by reapproximation of the defect generally provides satisfactory cosmetic results. While the gross surgical margin after vulvar resection is reduced by 15 percent when measured in the final fixed specimen, a grossly negative 1 cm margin will rarely harbor significant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, the traditionally recommended 1 cm margin is often hard to accomplish, as the surgeon has to balance the desire for complete excision with preservation of vulvar anatomy and function. </p><p>It is also important to take the multifocal nature of VIN into consideration. A negative margin will only reduce the recurrence risk at that site, not the life-long risk of reoccurrence of VIN elsewhere on the vulva. </p><p>Regarding depth of excision, removal of the epidermis provides sufficient depth for treatment of VIN as long as the margins are clear. Removing a small amount of underlying dermis helps to ensure the absence of early invasive disease. Excision can be performed with a knife, electrosurgery, or carbon dioxide laser. The technique for vulvar excision is described in detail separately.

If there is a grossly visible residual lesion, it should be treated. If a margin is positive microscopically, but there is no visible residual disease, the patient may be followed by close clinical observation and colposcopy. Re-treatment is provided if another visible lesion occurs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1062486\"><span class=\"h3\">Simple vulvectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple, or total, vulvectomy refers to removal of the entire vulva together with perineal tissues, as indicated, and usually includes some subcutaneous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. It may be performed for benign and premalignant conditions of the vulva that are extensive or multifocal.

It is used in the small proportion of patients in whom prior treatments such as topical treatments, laser ablation, or smaller excisions have failed to control disease. The procedure requires removing the vulvar skin along a relatively avascular plane beneath the epidermis, while preserving the subcutaneous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Primary closure can be achieved by either reapproximation or by using a split thickness skin graft.

It is most advantageous when there are multiple small lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Since tissue is ablated rather than excised, the coexistence of invasive cancer must be carefully excluded by liberal use of colposcopically directed biopsies prior to the procedure.</p><p>The goal of ablative therapy is to treat the entire area of intraepithelial abnormality. Colposcopy is used to control the depth of tissue destruction to less than 1 mm, which will ablate the intraepithelial lesion and allow for rapid healing. While 1 mm depth is sufficient ablation for hair-free epithelium, 3 mm depth is required in hairy areas of the vulva because the hair root sheet tends to extend as deep as 2.5 mm and is at significant risk for harboring VIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Superficial ablative therapy may offer cosmetic advantages over skinning vulvectomy. In contrast, deep laser vaporization results in destruction of the skin appendage, which leads to hypertrophic scar formation, thus negating the cosmetic advantages of laser over excisional surgery.</p><p>The limitations of laser ablation are that special training is required, and another method may be preferred for lesions in hair-bearing areas because laser treatment destroys the hair follicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative treatment with topical therapies aimed at preserving the vulvar anatomy has been attempted, particularly in younger patients.

Imiquimod appears to be effective therapy for high-grade VIN; however, further high quality data are needed. In particular, studies comparing imiquimod with other therapies are needed.</p><p>A systematic review of treatment of high-grade VIN that included the two randomized trials and eight observational studies (total n = 162) reported a complete response rate of 51 percent, partial response rate of 25 percent, and a recurrence rate of 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Imiquimod is applied topically to individual lesions, not to the entire vulva. A typical course of therapy is 16 weeks. Side effects of imiquimod consist mostly of inflammation at the application site, including mild to moderate erythema or erosions. Side effects of imiquimod are common; up to two-thirds of patients reduce the number of applications due to local side effects, mostly from three to two times per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].

This histologic type is often found adjacent to keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma or in patients with a history of vulvar carcinoma. In addition, it is likely to occur in postmenopausal patients, and thus age may also play a role in the risk of malignancy. Available data include one study of 67 women with a diagnosis of solitary VIN, differentiated type in which 33 percent had a subsequent diagnosis of vulvar carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In another study, 86 percent of women (n = 70) with VIN, differentiated type also had invasive carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. This study contributes little information regarding the choice of treatment or prognosis for a patient with an initial diagnosis of VIN, differentiated type, because it included women with vulvar carcinoma prior to, synchronous with, or following the diagnosis of VIN.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126218\"><span class=\"h3\">Coexistent VIN and carcinoma at diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retrospective case series have reported the presence of occult squamous carcinoma in 10 to 22 percent of women with a preoperative diagnosis of VIN who were treated with surgical excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/13,23,38,79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23,38,79,80</a>].

The latter may be an underestimate, as not all patients underwent excisional therapy. In the same study, another 3.3 percent of patients were diagnosed with carcinomas during follow-up.</p><p>Data regarding risk factors for occult carcinoma are limited to small case series. In one series (n = 74), women with versus without occult carcinoma were significantly less likely to have multifocal disease (12 versus 54 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Interestingly, women with or without occult carcinoma did not differ significantly by age (the average age was 45 to 46 years in both groups) or recurrent VIN (occult carcinoma: 35 percent versus no occult carcinoma: 29 percent). The presence of invasive carcinoma was also not significantly associated with tobacco use, genital warts, or cervical neoplasia. Another series also found no increased risk of coexistent carcinoma in older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

A 2005 systematic review of 3322 patients with VIN 3 found that 6.5 percent developed invasive vulvar carcinoma; one-half of these were occult carcinomas detected during diagnostic evaluation and therapy, and the other one-half were discovered during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>There appear to be two distinct patterns of invasive vulvar carcinoma in women treated for VIN. One pattern is the development of invasive carcinoma at a prior site of frequently incompletely treated VIN and reflects disease progression. In these cases, carcinoma is observed after a median of 2.4 years following VIN treatment. In the other pattern, an invasive carcinoma develops several years later at a site distinct from the previously treated VIN and represents a new neoplasm in the area at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunization with quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which is active against HPV subtypes 6, 11, 16, and 18, has been found to decrease the risk of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/8,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,83</a>]. The bivalent HPV vaccine (subtypes 16 and 18) has not been studied for VIN prevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Smoking cessation and treatment of vulvar dermatoses that may develop into vulvar neoplasia (ie, lichen sclerosus) may also help prevent VIN. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The International Society for the Study of Vulvar Diseases (ISSVD) 2015 terminology for vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) includes these categories (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vulvar low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Differentiated VIN (dVIN) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vulvar LSIL (not a premalignant lesion and equivalent to flat condylomata acuminata, or human papillomavirus [HPV] changes) and vulvar HSIL include HPV-associated disease, whereas differentiated VIN is not HPV-associated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of VIN is higher in premenopausal women than postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women, VIN is often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, immunosuppression, or cigarette smoking, and is multifocal. Postmenopausal women are more likely to have non-HPV associated VIN and unifocal lesions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Vulvar HSIL'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differentiated VIN'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no screening strategies for VIN. Pruritus is the most common symptom of VIN. Other presentations include a visible lesion, a palpable abnormality, pain, or dysuria, but many women are asymptomatic. Squamous intraepithelial neoplasia in more than one location (vulva, vagina, cervix, or perianal area) is relatively common. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H275134\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue biopsy is necessary for a definitive diagnosis. VIN may be associated with or progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. VIN can be difficult to distinguish clinically from lichen sclerosus or lichen planus, especially when they occur concurrently. Therefore, any lesion on the vulva that is not known to be benign warrants biopsy, as does any lesion that does not resolve with a defined course of medical therapy. Appropriate sites for biopsy are identified by physical examination and colposcopy. (See <a href=\"#H659818\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of treatment are to prevent development of invasive vulvar carcinoma and relieve symptoms, while preserving normal vulvar anatomy and function. Treatment is individualized based upon biopsy results, extent of disease, and the woman's symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with <strong>vulvar HSIL</strong> who have a lesion that is worrisome for possible invasive disease (eg, a lesion that is raised, ulcerative, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has irregular borders) and those with clinically significant risk factors for invasive disease (previous VIN or vulvar carcinoma, immunosuppression, tobacco use, age &ge;45 years, lichen sclerosus), surgical excision is required. (See <a href=\"#H64754861\" class=\"local\">'Choice of treatment method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, for women with <strong>vulvar HSIL</strong> in whom malignancy is not suspected or has been excluded, we treat with excision for single lesions that allow complete removal with satisfactory cosmetic and functional results. We prefer ablative therapy rather than excision for young women, multifocal disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lesions that involve areas in which excision may result in adverse effects (urethra, anus, clitoris, vaginal introitus). We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> for selected women with recurrent lesions. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> only as a last resort when other therapies have failed, since it is associated with adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H64754861\" class=\"local\">'Choice of treatment method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with <strong>differentiated VIN</strong>, we recommend surgical excision rather than ablation or pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H64754861\" class=\"local\">'Choice of treatment method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite treatment, VIN recurs in one-third of women, and approximately 4 to 8 percent develop invasive carcinoma. Therefore, long-term surveillance of the entire lower genital tract is mandatory. We suggest follow-up every six months for five years after the last treatment, and then annually.
