The clinical diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) is based upon a combination of features such as positive blood cultures, echocardiographic findings, and other clinical or laboratory criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73023%7EID%2F53004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73023 graphicRef53004 \">table 1A-B</a>) as specified in the modified Duke criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Performing an initial TTE is usually recommended, especially in individuals without a prior TTE. Many cardiologists recommend first-line TEE when a TTE is not going to be diagnostic, such as for a patient with one or more prosthetic heart valves or prior technically difficult quality TTE. The decision on when to use TEE is individualized, taking into account clinical risk factors, patient examination findings, laboratory data, and diagnostic quality of the TTE.</p><p>The transmission of ultrasound between the transducer and the heart is impeded by obesity, hyperinflated lungs during mechanical ventilation, narrow interspaces, <span class=\"nowrap\">valve/annular</span> calcification, and valve prostheses. All of these factors may obscure the visualization of vegetations. TEE is less susceptible to these constraints and usually provides excellent image quality. </p><p>Strict TTE criteria, where a TEE is unlikely to yield additional diagnostic information among individuals with bacteremia, have been proposed after an analysis of 790 individuals with both TTE and TEE in suspected endocarditis. When the TTE had moderate or better ultrasound quality, normal anatomy, no valvular stenosis or sclerosis, less than mild valvular vegetation, no significant pericardial effusion, no catheter or pacemaker leads, and no evidence of vegetation, the negative predictive value of TTE was 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The accuracy of TTE for detecting vegetations in IE has been evaluated in a variety of studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73652\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73652 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52651\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef52651 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55154\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55154 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79209\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79209 \">movie 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70221\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef70221 \">movie 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62352%7ECARD%2F53904\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62352 graphicRef53904 \">image 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66283\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66283 \">image 2</a>). The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines have estimated the sensitivity of TTE for IE to be around 70 percent for native valves and 50 percent for prosthetic valves, with a specificity of approximately 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A meta-analysis of 16 articles on TTE found similar values with sensitivity of 66 percent and a specificity of 95 percent for native valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Situations where TTE may not identify vegetations include poor acoustic windows, underlying valve thickening, valvular calcification, redundant leaflet tissue, prosthetic shadowing, or recent vegetation <span class=\"nowrap\">migration/embolization</span>. The measurements of structures in echocardiographic studies are limited by image resolution. TTE underestimates the size and complexity of large vegetations and may fail to detect small vegetations (&lt;3 mm in diameter).</p><p>The role of TEE in the diagnosis of IE is related to its superior visualization and spatial resolution leading to higher sensitivity in detecting and defining valve vegetations and other complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65848\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef65848 \">movie 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58456\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef58456 \">movie 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81420\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef81420 \">movie 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58762\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef58762 \">movie 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74517\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef74517 \">movie 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76481%7ECARD%2F65378%7ECARD%2F74507\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76481 graphicRef65378 graphicRef74507 \">image 3A-C</a>). The sensitivity of TEE for vegetation is approximately 96 percent for native valves and 92 percent for prosthetic valves, and the specificity for both is approximately 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of TEE for detecting an abscess is approximately 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography is now available and has the capability of offering spatial information about the size and attachment of vegetations and increased sensitivity for detecting and sizing abscess cavities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. 3D echocardiography also helps facilitate the diagnosis of prosthetic valve dehiscence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95614\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef95614 \">movie 11</a>). However, 3D-echocardiography is subject to the same constraints on image quality as both TTE and TEE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3145540064\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO NEEDS A TTE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple professional societies recommend a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for individuals with suspected IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. A TTE provides an evaluation of ventricular function, chamber sizes, valvular morphology and valvular function, and hemodynamics. &#160;</p><p>Suspected IE is based on Duke criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73023 \">table 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53004 \">table 1B</a>). For an individual with positive blood cultures, new or worsening regurgitant murmur, or with minor criteria of predisposing conditions, fever, vascular phenomena, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunologic phenomena, a TTE is an important initial diagnostic step. In general, echocardiography is rarely appropriate for suspected endocarditis if fever is the only indication. </p><p>A TTE is also recommended for re-evaluation for individuals with a change in signs or symptoms (eg, new murmur, embolism, persistent fever, heart failure, abscess, or atrioventricular heart block) and in patients at high risk of complications (eg, extensive infected <span class=\"nowrap\">tissue/large</span> vegetation on initial echocardiogram or staphylococcal, enterococcal, or fungal infections).</p><p>There is debate on the timing of follow-up TTE for individuals with continued suspicion for IE despite negative initial examination. Occasionally, a valvular vegetation may be too small on initial examination and may grow over time. The European Society of Cardiology recommends repeating a TTE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> TEE five to seven days after an initial negative examination for individuals at high suspicion of IE, and the American Heart Association recommends a repeat TEE three to five days after an initial negative TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. In our clinical practice, we evaluate for a change in signs or symptoms on an ongoing basis, and we would usually wait approximately four to five days before repeating a study in stable patients if there are no other changes. For an individual with a large vegetation, where change in size of vegetation is a factor influencing the potential need for surgery, more frequent limited follow-up TTE may be considered especially if there is clinical progression (eg, development of heart block, heart failure, ongoing bacteremia, etc) that indicates a need for surgery.</p><p>We also typically repeat a TTE within one to two weeks after the completion of antibiotics. This evaluates the severity of residual regurgitation and the extent and size of residual vegetations, if present. If there is future concern for recurrent endocarditis, comparison with the echocardiogram after completion of therapy can be useful. (See <a href=\"#H4182289745\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up echocardiograms'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2233810817\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO NEEDS A TEE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The implications of an initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examination that fails to show vegetations in a patient with suspected IE should be carefully considered. If there is high clinical suspicion, a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be performed. The sensitivity of TEE has been reported as 92 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. Although TEE cannot definitively exclude endocarditis, its high diagnostic sensitivity results in a low probability of the disease when negative results are obtained in a patient with an intermediate likelihood of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3,9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TEE is recommended in patients with high clinical suspicion of IE and a negative or nondiagnostic TTE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TEE is recommended in all patients with known or suspected endocarditis when complications have developed or are clinically suspected, or when intracardiac device leads are present.</p><p/><p>TEE is recommended for patients with prosthetic valves and for identification of abscess, for which TEE has better sensitivity than TTE. TEE is also recommended for those with high clinical probability of IE, such as when modified Duke criteria indicate possible IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73023 \">table 1A</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TTE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> TEE are recommended for reevaluation of patients with IE who have a change in clinical signs or symptoms (eg, new murmur, embolism, persistent fever, heart failure, abscess, or atrioventricular heart block) and in patients at high risk of complications (eg, extensive infected <span class=\"nowrap\">tissue/large</span> vegetation on initial echocardiogram or staphylococcal, enterococcal, or fungal infections).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TEE is reasonable to diagnose possible IE in patients with <em>Staphylococcal aureus</em> bacteremia without a known source.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TEE is reasonable to diagnose IE of a prosthetic valve in the presence of persistent fever without bacteremia or a new murmur.</p><p/><p>Repeat TEE examination may sometimes be necessary and relevant as vegetations or abscesses may develop and grow over time.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and outcome of infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1759628843\"><span class=\"h2\">Valvular regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial infiltration and proliferation in valve tissue can destroy the leaflet integrity, leading to regurgitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55154\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55154 \">movie 3</a>). In general, the etiology of valve deterioration has little impact on the echocardiographic features of severe valvular regurgitation. However, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate a disrupted, prolapsing and flail segment of leaflet from a mobile prolapsing vegetation. Each has the same motion during the cardiac cycle, echocardiographic tissue characteristics are similar, and both may be present in the same location. Mistaking a flail leaflet for a vegetation may lead to miscalculation of risk level or overdiagnosis of endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) substantially aids distinguishing a flail leaflet from vegetation, and this capacity contributes to its advantages as a prognostic and diagnostic tool.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3895146514\"><span class=\"h2\">Perivalvular abscess or fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the infectious process spreads beyond the valve leaflets or the cavitary endocardium, it invades the continuous basal myocardium and tissue of the fibrous cardiac skeleton. Early in this process, the organism produces cellulitis, which may be identified as echodense thickening of perivalvular tissue. If tissue necrosis and white cell activity continue, the central portion of this process forms a space-occupying abscess cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74507\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74507 \">image 3C</a>). Abscess formation is most likely with <em>S. aureus</em> infection.</p><p>Since the myocardial wall is under considerable pressure, the weakened necrotic tissue may become disrupted and the abscess cavity may communicate with either ventricle or a great vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65848\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef65848 \">movie 6</a>). In the setting of such a communication, the abscess cavity can also be viewed as a pseudoaneurysm, particularly if it involves the aortic wall directly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The distinction between an abscess and pseudoaneurysm can be made with TEE color flow Doppler, which will demonstrate flow into a pseudoaneurysm but not into an abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Complete disruption of the wall may lead to a fistulous connection with intracardiac shunting between chambers, most commonly between the aorta and either atrium causing a continuous murmur, between either atrium and either ventricle causing a systolic murmur, or between the left ventricle and right ventricle.</p><p>The most important feature of myocardial abscess formation is the increased morbidity and mortality (32 to 45 percent in different series) associated with this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. If the abscess extends into the septum, the conduction system may be interrupted or conduction slowed; a right bundle branch block with first degree AV block may ensue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

One study, for example, evaluated 118 patients with endocarditis, 44 (37 percent) of whom had an abscess documented at surgery or autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of TEE were 87 and 95 percent, respectively; the sensitivity of TTE was much lower (28 versus 87 percent with TEE) although the specificity was 99 percent. A similar wide discrepancy in sensitivity (25 versus 100 percent with TEE) was noted in another report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Transthoracic echocardiography is most effective for detecting an anterior abscess at the aortic septal junction because of transducer proximity to this region.</p><p>While TEE is more sensitive than TTE for detecting an abscess, even TEE may miss an abscess in some populations. This was illustrated in a report of 44 patients with surgically identified abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Only 21 (48 percent) were detected by TEE. Sixty-one percent of missed abscesses were located at the posterior mitral annulus, and the majority of these were associated with a large calcification that may have interfered with abscess detection.</p><p>The likelihood of detection of periaortic annular abscess by TEE in patients with aortic endocarditis was studied by the International Collaboration of Endocarditis merged database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Of 311 patients in the database, 22 percent had abscesses. The abscess was more likely to occur in the setting of a prosthetic valve (40 versus 19 percent) with coagulase-negative staphylococcal IE. Surgery was more likely, and mortality in hospital was higher (19 versus 11 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368273800\"><span class=\"h2\">Other complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other complications that are best detected with TEE include leaflet perforation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79920\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79920 \">movie 12</a>), true aneurysm formation, secondary infection of other valves resulting from vegetation contact (for example secondary mitral valve involvement with primary aortic valve endocarditis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and vegetations on the chamber walls that are struck by the jets of blood passing through the infected valves. As an example, one study that correlated the results of TTE and TEE with anatomic findings at surgery in 88 valves from patients with endocarditis, the sensitivity of TEE for the detection of valve perforation was significantly higher than that of TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Dehiscence can be the only manifestation of IE with a prosthetic valve in the absence of vegetation or abscess. If new valvular dehiscence is identified in any individual, even without obvious sign of infection, blood cultures should be considered. A valve rocking motion may indicate valve dehiscence. Paravalvular regurgitation may also indicate prosthetic valve endocarditis but should be compared with any prior paravalvular regurgitation. If prior data are lacking, moderate to severe but not mild paravalvular regurgitation should be considered suggestive of endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The use of TTE for detecting prosthetic valve endocarditis is impeded by suboptimal visualization because prosthetic materials are highly reflective and usually block the passage of ultrasound. As a result, prosthetic valves shadow or obscure structures lying behind the valve. As an example, it is usually impossible to image the atrial side of the mitral prosthesis or the arterial side of the aortic prosthesis from an apical TTE window.</p><p>TEE solves this problem for mitral prostheses and improves it for aortic prostheses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58762\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef58762 \">movie 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74517\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef74517 \">movie 10</a>).
