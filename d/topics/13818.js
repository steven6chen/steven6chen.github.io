It happens when certain blood vessels get inflamed. This can damage the blood vessels and keep them from carrying enough blood to body parts that need it.</p><p>PAN is a serious condition. Often, people who do not get treatment die from it.</p><p>PAN can happen in people who do not have other health problems. It can also happen in people who have certain diseases. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with a virus, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV (the virus that causes AIDS)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A type of cancer called &quot;hairy cell leukemia&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116244768\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of PAN?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight without trying</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle pain and weakness </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes &ndash; These are more common on the legs. They can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Red bumps that hurt </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Red or purple spots on the skin that do not turn white when you press on them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A purple pattern on the skin, which might be raised above the skin around it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Open sores or blisters</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness, tingling, and decreased feeling in the hands or feet &ndash; At first, this might happen on just one side of the body. It usually spreads to both sides. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain &ndash; Some people have other symptoms of belly problems, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diarrhea or blood in bowel movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the testicles (in men)</p><p/><p>PAN can also cause high blood pressure. This can be dangerous for your heart and other organs. Your doctor or nurse will tell you if you have it.</p><p>Most people who have PAN have symptoms in several parts of the body at once. But PAN sometimes affects just one area, such as the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116244783\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your symptoms. You might have some or all of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest X-ray &ndash; A chest X-ray creates a picture of your lungs. It can tell the doctor if you have PAN or a different condition. Some other diseases cause symptoms like those of PAN. These diseases usually affect the lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart. PAN sometimes affects the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; In this test, the doctor takes a small sample of tissue from a body part that has symptoms. Another doctor looks at the tissue under a microscope to check for signs of PAN.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arteriogram &ndash; For this test, the doctor injects a dye into an artery in a part of the body that is affected by PAN. The dye shows up on imaging tests, such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs. These imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. The dye can show problems with the blood vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116244797\"><span class=\"h1\">How is PAN treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors give medicines to control PAN and keep it from getting worse. Many people can take pills by mouth for PAN. But some people need medicine through an &quot;IV.&quot; This is a thin tube that goes into a vein.</p><p>Treatment for PAN usually takes at least 6 months. It can take more than 1 year to get rid of symptoms. The medicines that treat PAN can cause serious side effects. Your doctor or nurse might give you other medicines to help keep these side effects from happening or make them less serious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116244811\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some medicines that treat PAN are not safe to take if you are pregnant. If you have PAN, ask your doctor or nurse if it is safe for you to get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116244827\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis B (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis C (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=renovascular-hypertension-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Renovascular hypertension (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vasculitis (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vasculitis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
