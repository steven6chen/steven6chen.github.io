This topic will discuss issues related to transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage. Issues related to cervical insufficiency and transvaginal cervical cerclage are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical insufficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transvaginal-cervical-cerclage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transvaginal cervical cerclage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING A TRANSABDOMINAL VERSUS A TRANSVAGINAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The open transabdominal approach is obviously a more morbid procedure than the transvaginal approach, since a laparotomy is performed for placement and later for cesarean delivery. The procedure can also be performed laparoscopically, which is minimally invasive and thus associated with more rapid recovery but still more morbid than the transvaginal approach. Given the increased morbidity of any transabdominal procedure compared with a transvaginal procedure, most experts recommend reserving the transabdominal approach for women with cervical insufficiency who meet one (or both) of the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failed to deliver a healthy newborn after at least one previous elective transvaginal cerclage (ie, does not include a rescue cerclage performed for advanced cervical dilation on physical examination).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The type of elective cerclage does not influence our decision. No compelling evidence indicates that, before resorting to a transabdominal approach, a Shirodkar cerclage should be attempted in the pregnancy after a failed prophylactic McDonald cerclage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are unable to undergo a transvaginal procedure because an extremely short or absent cervix, amputated cervix, marked cervical scarring, or cervical defect make it technically impossible to perform.</p><p/><p>In these settings, a transabdominal approach appears to result in better birth outcomes than the transvaginal approach, thus justifying its greater morbidity. In a systematic review of observational studies that evaluated pregnancy outcome after open transabdominal cerclage in women whose prior pregnancy ended in midtrimester loss or preterm birth before 34 weeks despite placement of a transvaginal cerclage, transabdominal cerclage was associated with a lower likelihood of perinatal death or delivery before 24 weeks of gestation (6 percent versus 12.5 percent when another transvaginal cerclage was performed) but a higher rate of serious operative complications, such as need for transfusion or organ injury (3 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Subsequent studies have reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Improvement in birth outcome may be due to more proximal placement of the stitch (at the level of the internal os), decreased risk of caudal suture migration as the uterus enlarges, and absence of a foreign body in the vagina that could promote infection and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As with any surgical procedure, we believe the technical skill and experience of the operator are important factors for a successful outcome.</p><p>The laparoscopic approach is equally effective and probably superior to the open approach as long as the provider has the requisite laparoscopic experience to perform the procedure. In a systematic review of observational studies that evaluated pregnancy outcome after laparoscopic versus open transabdominal cerclage, overall neonatal survival was about 90 percent for both procedures; however, the laparoscopic group had higher survival when first trimester losses were excluded (96.5 versus 90.1 percent), a higher rate of deliveries after 34 weeks (82.9 versus 76 percent), and lower rates of deliveries at 23.0 to 33.6 weeks (6.8 versus 14.8 percent) and second-trimester losses (3.2 versus 7.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Intraoperative and perioperative complications were similar for the two approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3284976046\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to transabdominal cerclage are similar to those for transvaginal cervical cerclage. The major contraindications are clinical scenarios where the procedure is unlikely to reduce the risk of preterm birth or improve fetal outcome: fetal anomaly incompatible with life, intrauterine infection, active uterine bleeding, active preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and fetal demise. The presence of fetal membranes prolapsing through the external cervical os is a relative contraindication because the risk of iatrogenic rupture of the membranes in this setting may exceed 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Placenta previa on ultrasound examination is not an absolute contraindication to cerclage placement; whether it decreases the risk of bleeding is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO PATIENTS PRESENTING PRECONCEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either cerclage placement after conception once fetal viability has been established or preconception transabdominal cerclage in patients planning to conceive who meet criteria are acceptable options. There is no consensus as to the best approach.</p><p>Preconception placement provides optimum exposure, reduces risks of excessive bleeding, and eliminates the risk of injury to the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Very limited data suggest preconception placement does not impair fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>No randomized trials have compared outcomes with preconception versus postconception cerclage. A review of 14 studies of abdominal cerclage published between 1990 and 2013 and involving a total of 678 patients reported live birth rates were similar whether abdominal cerclage was performed before or during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a subsequent study of 161 consecutive women who underwent preconceptual or first-trimester transabdominal cerclage, consecutive women who underwent preconceptual transabdominal cerclage versus first trimester reported that preconception placement was associated with more successful pregnancies &gt;34 weeks (90 versus 74 percent) and fewer serious surgical complications and hemorrhage &gt;500 mL (0 versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1688412087\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO PATIENTS PRESENTING IN EARLY PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients presenting in early pregnancy, a transabdominal cerclage should be placed in the late first trimester to early second trimester as the risk of miscarriage is lower than earlier in gestation, major structural anomalies can be excluded by ultrasound, information from early aneuploidy screening (if desired) is available, and the uterus is not too large to make it technically challenging. Later placement is undesirable since the large size of the uterus makes the procedure difficult and thus may be associated with a higher risk of complications. However, case reports have described the performance of the procedure at 18 to 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Due to the size of the uterus, it is challenging to perform the procedure laparoscopically after 14 to 15 weeks of gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not administer prophylactic antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Open transabdominal approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The open procedure is usually performed with the patient in the supine position but may be done in a modified lithotomy position if intraoperative transvaginal manipulation of the uterus or transvaginal ultrasound examination of the cervix is necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The abdominal cavity is entered through a transverse or vertical incision and the peritoneal bladder reflection is taken down by sharp and blunt dissection to expose the cervicoisthmic junction, the uterine artery, and the parametrial vessels. The uterine vessels can be palpated between the thumb and forefinger and should be drawn laterally away from the uterus, thereby exposing an avascular space immediately adjacent to the cervicoisthmic junction. It may help to have an assistant elevate and cradle the uterus out of the pelvis to provide optimum exposure of the vessels and isthmus. Handling the uterus gently is particularly important during pregnancy to avoid kinking the uterine blood supply and disrupting the placenta and to maintain uterine quiescence.</p><p>The avascular space at the level of the cervicouterine junction between the lateral wall of the uterus and the ascending and descending branches of the uterine arteries is identified. A 15 cm long, 5 mm Mersilene tape (polyester tape) is passed through this space from anterior to posterior. This can be achieved using a Mersilene band preloaded onto a needle, or by creating a tunnel through this avascular space and the posterior leaf of the broad ligament using a long right-angled forceps or Moynihan clamp. Care should be taken as the nearby paracervical veins are prone to injury. If venous bleeding occurs, it can usually be controlled with a hemostatic clip. A polypropylene suture can be used instead of Mersilene tape, but we prefer Mersilene because of its larger surface area.</p><p>The identical procedure is repeated on the opposite side, except the needle is passed from posterior to anterior. Alternatively, the Mersilene band can be placed through the lateral myometrium to minimize the risk of trauma to the uterine vessels.</p><p>The Mersilene tape should be wrapped around the posterior uterine isthmus at the level of the uterosacral ligament insertions, made to lie flat against the uterus, tied to slightly compress the intervening tissue, and secured with a triple square knot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65514\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65514 \">figure 1</a>). The ends can be sutured to the tape with fine nonabsorbable sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The surgeon&rsquo;s preference can determine the location of the knot, anterior versus posterior.</p><p>In pregnant patients, ultrasound is occasionally used to monitor the fetal heart rate to ascertain that blood flow through the uterine artery has not been compromised by the procedure and to ensure that the membranes are above the level of the cerclage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Videos of the laparoscopic technique are available <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=laparoscopic+abdominal+cerclage+during+pregnancy%2C+youtube&oq=laparoscopic+abdominal+cerclage+during+pregnancy%2C+youtube&gs_l=psy-ab.3...4879.6525.0.6902.9.9.0.0.0.0.116.789.8j1.9.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.8.702...0j0i22i30k1j33i21k1j33i160k1.0.ZAW3jPCtWRU&amp;token=FMk0nckGB0YYmtXvp5YLFQMwmSTyhBo8b+CbsgwnQxu/adqFsbJeKcuCxUdZe7muAP6WDFP+FY0oKm6g/ncjTAhZNuBxU7WVMnWT8oOabZkSN/0Zyir+FfohpEi1rtCas8rGUl9V5QETBHS87jY4ukIaVjypPuOl4dXCMrf/uky0a9ez7IOqdzjsuAUrnrSArtXpbmCUjFgRfoQUpE74zOJrBSoQHxklySiBPZkT1GHxpnkX63XRzXN+g49wkYvT&amp;TOPIC_ID=6739\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">online</a>. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia with the patient in dorsal lithotomy position. The bladder is continuously drained with a urinary catheter. Port placement is at the discretion of the surgeon but typically includes three to four ports: one in the midline for the camera, two in the bilateral lower quadrants, and one in an upper quadrant. For cases performed during pregnancy, it is important to assess the size and position of the gravid uterus to avoid it during entry. A sponge stick can be used to delineate the cervicovaginal junction and help position the uterus. In nonpregnant women, we use a uterine manipulator for this purpose.</p><p>The procedure begins by opening the vesicouterine peritoneum across the lower uterine segment with an ultrasonic scalpel or monopolar shears. The bladder is reflected caudad, and the cervicoisthmic junction is skeletonized to reveal the uterine vessels anteriorly.</p><p>A nonabsorbable suture should be used. The most commonly described suture for laparoscopic cerclage is the 5 mm Mersilene polyester tape (Ethicon). Double arm CTX or BP-1 needles can be used, with each needle straightened to allow passage through the ports and to facilitate cerclage placement.</p><p>The knot may be tied anteriorly or posteriorly. If tying the knot anteriorly, each needle is passed posteriorly to anteriorly using the uterosacral ligaments as landmarks. The needle should be inserted at the level of the cervicoisthmic junction, medial to the uterine vessels and lateral to the cervix. If the needle is placed too lateral, it can cause bleeding from the uterine vessels. If the needle is placed too medial, it can impair the cerclage&rsquo;s performance or enter the cervix. Since the needles on the Mersilene tape are rather blunt, it is good to err on being slightly too medial during placement, and if significant resistance is felt, then move the trajectory slightly more laterally. If the patient is not pregnant and a uterine manipulator is in place, the uterus can be carefully moved from an anteverted to retroverted position and twisted slightly to assist with needle passage. Once passed, the needles are cut off and removed.</p><p>Intracorporeal knot tying is more feasible when using the Mersilene tape. The Mersilene suture is tied tightly around the cervix with six knots. Some surgeons will then tack the ends of the Mersilene tape down to the lower uterine segment with a 2-0 silk suture. The suture may prevent the ends of the tape from eroding into the bladder and may ease identification of the cerclage during an eventual cesarean delivery. The vesicouterine peritoneum may then be reapproximated with running 2-0 Monocryl suture (Ethicon) that is tied intracorporeally.</p><p>Robotic-assisted transabdominal laparoscopic cerclage has been performed successfully in nonpregnant and pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].

It involves placement of a &quot;high&quot; Shirodkar cerclage at the level of the cervicoisthmic junction after surgical reflection of the bladder anteriorly and the rectum posteriorly. It appears to be less morbid than the transabdominal approach and to have similar efficacy if actually placed in the cervicoisthmic area, but experience is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative follow-up is similar to that with transvaginal cerclage.

In one series of 300 procedures performed over a 24-year time span, the rate of transfusion was &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The risk of hemorrhage can be minimized if the cerclage is placed prior to conception, when the pelvic vessels are smaller [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In the same large series, fetal loss (prior to 20 weeks) occurred in 4.1 percent of pregnancies, but the rate was lower, 1.3 percent (3 in 226 cases), when only singleton losses within two weeks of the procedure were considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

At cesarean, the infant is delivered through a hysterotomy incision made above the cerclage.</p><p>Of note, although case reports have described laparoscopic or transvaginal cerclage removal before delivery to allow a trial of labor and vaginal birth, we do not recommend this as the procedure is technically challenging and potentially morbid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H728701004\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of the cerclage after delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An advantage of transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage over transvaginal cervical cerclage is the ability to leave the suture in place for future pregnancies. The cerclage can be removed at cesarean delivery if the patient is not planning additional pregnancies, or left in place if future pregnancies are planned. There are no available data on the frequency of abdominal cerclage reuse and outcomes.</p><p>If the cerclage was not removed at cesarean delivery and childbearing has been completed, one author does not perform an additional surgical procedure just to remove an asymptomatic cerclage, given the procedure is not straightforward, there is a risk of injury, and the risk of complications if the cerclage is left in situ appears to be very low. He has seen only two cases of erosion, which occurred following a radical trachelectomy and cerclage placement. The other author generally removes an abdominal cerclage when childbearing is complete, unless the patient is a poor surgical candidate or if surgical removal is anticipated to be difficult.</p><p>It remains unclear which approach is better since the risk of infection and erosion are very low either way and data are limited to case reports. In these reports, failure to remove a transabdominal cerclage has been associated with adverse events several years after placement, including infection and erosion of the cerclage into the vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although indirect evidence, erosion of synthetic materials used in genitourinary procedures is well-described, as are complications from prolonged retention of vaginally placed cerclages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF FETAL DEMISE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1289784008\"><span class=\"h2\">First trimester</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the event of a fetal loss in the first trimester, cervical dilation and evacuation of the uterus can be safely and effectively performed without removal of the transabdominal cerclage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2344417458\"><span class=\"h2\">Early to mid second trimester</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For an early second trimester pregnancy loss, dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) can be accomplished successfully in some cases with the cerclage in situ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transabdominal-and-laparoscopic-cervicoisthmic-cerclage/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. It may be possible to dilate the cervix adequately to allow insertion of a 12 to 16 mm cannula and Sopher forceps; laminaria can be used to facilitate dilation, if necessary. Cannulae up to 16 mm permit evacuation of gestations through approximately 16 to 18 weeks, and longer if the products of conception are highly macerated. However, the cerclage may become disrupted by these procedures. If the cerclage needs to be removed, this can be performed laparoscopically, followed by transvaginal D&amp;E.</p><p>It may be technically feasible to remove the cerclage through a transvaginal colpotomy, thereby permitting vaginal delivery.
