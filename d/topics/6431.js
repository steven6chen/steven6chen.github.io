Patients with this psoriasis subtype typically present with erythema involving more than 75 percent of the body surface area and associated scale, pustules, or exfoliation of the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111552%7EDERM%2F111553%7EDERM%2F111554\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111552 graphicRef111553 graphicRef111554 \">picture 1A-C</a>). </p><p>Recognition of this potentially life-threatening form of psoriasis is imperative. A detailed history and thorough evaluation of the patient are necessary to establish a diagnosis and rule out conditions that closely mimic erythrodermic psoriasis.

There are several psoriasis subtypes, including chronic plaque, psoriatic arthritis, inverse, guttate, pustular, and erythrodermic variants. Erythrodermic psoriasis is the least common psoriasis subtype and occurs in less than 3 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some experts have suggested that the distinction between pustular and erythrodermic psoriasis is arbitrary given their frequent co-occurrence and overlapping clinical features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H187654520\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>The age of onset of erythroderma is highly variable. In a series of 50 patients with erythrodermic psoriasis, the average age of onset was 48 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There appears to be a slight predilection for males in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; however, detailed epidemiologic data for this condition are limited due to its rarity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1729190946\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to other psoriasis variants, erythrodermic psoriasis is the result of a complex interaction between the skin, environmental and genetic factors, and the immune system. Few studies have examined the molecular mechanisms driving the development of this disease variant, and the immunopathogenesis is not fully understood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of psoriasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A study evaluating the gene expression profiles of involved skin from patients with chronic plaque, inverse, and erythrodermic variants of psoriasis found similarities among these variants, suggesting a shared pathway for disease development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. More than 95 percent of the differentially expressed genes in erythrodermic psoriasis were also differentially expressed in plaque psoriasis. Differential expression of genes relating to the interleukin-17A signaling pathway accounted for the greatest amount of similarity between plaque and erythrodermic psoriasis. However, differences in the T helper cell (Th) populations and inflammatory cytokines isolated from the blood of patients with erythrodermic psoriasis compared with plaque psoriasis have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>A shared pathway for erythroderma is suggested based upon a study that compared the immunophenotypic features of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Although the study found significant differences in the Th1:Th2 ratio between chronic psoriasis and chronic atopic dermatitis, no differences in the Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th22 cell populations were observed between erythrodermic psoriasis and erythrodermic atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2712997611\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major risk factors for erythrodermic psoriasis are a personal or family history of psoriasis, medication exposure (particularly systemic glucocorticoids), and medical illness. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History of psoriasis</strong> &ndash; The majority of patients with erythrodermic psoriasis have a known personal or family history of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Importantly, erythrodermic psoriasis may be the initial presentation of psoriasis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medications</strong> &ndash; The most important medication-associated trigger of erythrodermic psoriasis is treatment with systemic glucocorticoids or the abrupt withdrawal of systemic antipsoriatic medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. Erythrodermic psoriasis can also be triggered by an administration of antipsoriatic medications, such as oral and topical retinoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tazarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tazarotene</a>), methotrexate, cyclosporine, and overuse of topical corticosteroids (ie, use of more than 60 g per week of a high-potency topical corticosteroid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other medications associated with the development of erythrodermic psoriasis include tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and pegylated interferon-alpha with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Infections have been proposed as triggers for erythrodermic psoriasis. In particular, patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have increased risk for erythrodermic psoriasis. The severity of psoriasis in HIV-infected patients positively correlates with the level of immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p>Other factors that have been reported to trigger erythrodermic psoriasis include burns from phototherapy or photochemotherapy treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>], alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and application of topical irritants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coal-tar-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">coal tar</a>, dithranol, and thiuram-containing rubber gloves ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,17</a>]. Case reports suggest that hypocalcemia can trigger erythrodermic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] or pustular forms of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. However, the relationship between psoriasis and serum calcium levels is unclear. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H187654520\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark of erythrodermic psoriasis is the development of widespread, confluent erythema of the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111552%7EDERM%2F111553%7EDERM%2F111554\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111552 graphicRef111553 graphicRef111554 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Erythema may develop rapidly (eg, over several days) or in a more gradual manner (eg, over several weeks). The percentage of body surface area involvement required for a patient to be considered erythrodermic is ambiguous; definitions range from 75 to more than 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>]. Scaling and exfoliation of the skin is common and usually develops several days after the onset of erythroderma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111557%7EDERM%2F111558%7EDERM%2F112110%7EDERM%2F112111\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111557 graphicRef111558 graphicRef112110 graphicRef112111 \">picture 2A-D</a>). There may be associated palmoplantar keratoderma. </p><p>The skin is often painful <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pruritic, particularly in areas with prominent scaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Photosensitivity also may be present. Associated extracutaneous findings may include fever, chills, malaise, tachycardia, arthralgias, and lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Laboratory abnormalities may include leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Erythrodermic psoriasis often exhibits pustules, similar to those occurring in pustular psoriasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F111555%7EDERM%2F111556\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111555 graphicRef111556 \">picture 3A-B</a>). The pustules commonly involve the extremities. In a series of 50 patients with erythrodermic psoriasis, 14 patients (28 percent) had pustules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Generalized pustular involvement has been reported and is representative of the overlap between erythrodermic psoriasis and generalized pustular psoriasis. There are no clinical features that reliably distinguish erythrodermic psoriasis with pustules from generalized pustular psoriasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pustular-psoriasis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pustular psoriasis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Associated nail disorders are common and range from pitting of the nail plate to more prominent nail dystrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> separation of the nail from the nail bed (onycholysis). In a series of 50 patients with erythrodermic psoriasis, 39 (78 percent) had nail disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Skin biopsies can aid in excluding other causes of erythroderma and are often helpful in establishing a diagnosis of erythrodermic psoriasis in challenging cases. Features characteristic of psoriasis often are present. </p><p>In a retrospective review of biopsies obtained from 45 patients diagnosed with erythrodermic psoriasis, biopsies from 40 patients (88 percent) had histologic features consistent with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Histologic features of early psoriasis (eg, slight epidermal hyperplasia with a reduced or absent granular layer, focal parakeratosis, and mild spongiosis) were observed in more than half of patients from this study, whereas the remaining patients had features of a fully developed (eg, marked epidermal hyperplasia, total loss of the granular layer, and confluent parakeratosis) or regressing (eg, slight epidermal hyperplasia and a normal or thickened granular layer) psoriasis plaque. The most common histologic feature observed in this study was marked dilation and coiling of vessels within the papillary dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis are the most common associated cutaneous diseases. Knowledge of the clinical features prior to the onset of erythroderma is often helpful for diagnosis. Features suggestive of atopic dermatitis include an early age of onset, strong association with allergic rhinitis and asthma, prominent involvement of flexural surfaces, and disease worsening triggered by xerosis. Seborrheic dermatitis is typically characterized by dry or greasy flakes of skin, which involve the scalp, eyebrows, glabella, or external ear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seborrheic-dermatitis-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seborrheic dermatitis in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adverse drug reactions are another common cause of erythroderma, accounting for approximately 20 percent of patients presenting with erythroderma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F88412\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88412 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythrodermic-psoriasis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Systemic signs and symptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, tachycardia, arthralgias, eosinophilia, anemia, lymphadenopathy, and photosensitivity, are commonly associated with erythrodermic psoriasis. (See <a href=\"#H187654520\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than half of all cases of erythrodermic psoriasis are attributed to the exacerbation of preexisting psoriasis. Important triggers include medications (eg, the withdrawal of oral or topical corticosteroids and the discontinuation or abrupt withdrawal of antipsoriatic therapies), infections, alcohol consumption, and stress. (See <a href=\"#H2712997611\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differentiating erythrodermic psoriasis from other causes of erythroderma is essential but frequently challenging. The diagnosis is made based upon the recognition of features of psoriasis in the patient history, physical examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin biopsy and the absence of features indicative of other causes of erythroderma. (See <a href=\"#H891387188\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of erythrodermic psoriasis include hemodynamic and metabolic disturbances, increased metabolic requirements, a defective skin barrier, impaired thermoregulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and susceptibility to skin infections, specifically staphylococcal septicemia. (See <a href=\"#H3159093775\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inpatient hospitalization may be necessary for close clinical evaluation, including hemodynamic monitoring, replacement of fluids and electrolytes, and assistance with the application of wet dressings. Patients with severe disease may require admission to the intensive care unit and often benefit from burn unit care where available. (See <a href=\"#H1362709506\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment guidelines for erythrodermic psoriasis are based on small uncontrolled studies, case series, case reports, and expert opinion. Factors such as severity of disease, patient comorbidities, and drug availability influence the selection of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1085426222\" class=\"local\">'Systemic psoriasis therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> as first-line therapy for erythrodermic psoriasis based upon the rapid onset of action of these therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acitretin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> are also first-line treatment options, though a slower onset of action makes them less preferable agents. (See <a href=\"#H1085426222\" class=\"local\">'Systemic psoriasis therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional treatments that may be effective include other tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>) and novel biologic medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, interleukin-17A inhibitors) used in the treatment of other psoriasis subtypes.
