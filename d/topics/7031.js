Doctors call these growths &quot;polyps.&quot; They are not cancer, but can turn into cancer.</p><p>Most people with FAP have hundreds or thousands of polyps. This means they have a much higher risk of colon cancer than other people. Without treatment, almost all people who have FAP get colon cancer by age 45. Some people have a milder form of FAP that causes fewer polyps.</p><p>People with FAP can also develop cancer of the stomach, small intestine, thyroid, pancreas, or brain.</p><p>FAP is caused by an abnormal gene that runs in families. People who have FAP usually start showing signs of it in their teens or 20s. But some people get it in childhood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195489\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of FAP?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FAP might not cause any symptoms. If it does, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bright red blood in bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea &ndash; Runny, watery bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation &ndash; Trouble having bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating &ndash; Feeling like the belly is full all the time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness</p><p/><p>If someone in your family has FAP, you might have regular tests to check for it. Your doctor or nurse might find it before you have symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195503\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about any symptoms you have. You might also have the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called a &quot;colonoscopy&quot; &ndash; In this test, the doctor puts a tube and a tiny camera through your anus and into your colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>). During the test, he or she can check for polyps and take samples of tissue for testing. Another doctor looks at the tissue under a microscope. It can show if you have FAP or a different condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called a &quot;sigmoidoscopy&quot; &ndash; This test is very similar to a colonoscopy, but it only looks at the last part of the colon, close to the rectum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called an &quot;upper endoscopy&quot; &ndash; This test uses a tube and tiny camera to check the upper digestive system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 3</a>). The doctor can also take samples of tissue in this test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing &ndash; This is a blood test to look for the abnormal gene that causes FAP. Before the test, you will talk with a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor is a person who can help you understand what having the gene could mean for you and your family.</p><p/><p>You might have these tests in a different order or more than once. For example, if someone in your family has FAP, you might have genetic testing to see if you have the abnormal gene. Or you might have a colonoscopy to look for polyps. If a genetic test shows you have FAP, you might have a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy. The tests can show your doctor how many polyps you have and where they are.</p><p>If you have FAP, your doctor might do exams or tests to look for other types of cancer, such as thyroid cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195520\"><span class=\"h1\">How is FAP treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your situation. Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to take out the colon &ndash; This is called a &quot;colectomy.&quot; It is the main treatment for FAP. Taking out the tissue with polyps lowers the risk of cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine to slow down polyps &ndash; Such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">celecoxib</a> (brand name: CeleBREX). Doctors can give this before or after a colectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyp removal &ndash; Some people have a milder form of FAP that causes fewer polyps. Sometimes, doctors can remove polyps during a colonoscopy or endoscopy instead of doing a colectomy.</p><p/><p>Your doctor will talk with you about the treatment most likely to prevent cancer in your situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10195535\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colectomy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-and-rectal-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon and rectal cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colon-polyps-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colon polyps (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
