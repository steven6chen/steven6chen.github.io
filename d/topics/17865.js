The treatment of MPPS is multimodal and tailored to the individual patient. Treatment plans typically include physical therapy, pharmacotherapy, and psychological counseling. The general approach is to block or reduce ongoing stimuli that lead to pain, identify and avoid triggers, and treat symptom flares. The process is defined as chronic after six months; however, patients early in the disease course often benefit from the same interventions, and such interventions may prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic.</p><p>This topic will discuss the treatment of MPPS. As there are few trials evaluating treatment efficacy in this population, our approach is based on the limited available data and clinical experience. Also, some therapies are extrapolated from the treatment of non-pelvic myofascial pain, such as myofascial pain associated with the back, neck, shoulder, or jaw. Topics related to the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of MPPS and chronic pain syndromes are reviewed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66154027\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MPPS is a non-articular musculoskeletal pain disorder characterized by contracted bands of skeletal muscle that contain discrete, painful nodules, also called trigger points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. MPPS is thought to originate at the trigger point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In our experience, the source of the pain is the pelvic floor muscles, which then impact the pelvic girdle (hip, low back, lower abdominal muscles). The pain can be perceived internally or become &quot;external&quot; (ie, perceived as abdominal, ischial tuberosity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vulvar pain). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women#H252992171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H991531292\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One goal of treatment is to help women understand that MPPS can be a chronic, waxing and waning condition that may require long-term management. We counsel patients that the etiology, triggers, and risk factors for MPPS are incompletely understood. Women who develop MPPS, especially those with severe symptoms, likely have a predisposition for symptom recurrence in response to certain triggers, including stress or physical trauma. In our experience, it is reasonable to expect 80 percent improvement in symptoms following the treatment plan, and the goal for women is fewer and less intense flares of pain. An additional long-term goal is to recognize and manage flares early with techniques that the women learn during treatment and that they know will be helpful. This element of control is important to reducing the anxiety that can accompany pain flares. In addition, we help women understand that improvement can be a slow process and, because there is not a &quot;one size fits all&quot; treatment, finding the correct therapy for them can take some trial and error, time, and patience.</p><p>We apply a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both physiological and psychological aspects of MPPS. Treatment interventions do not have to occur in isolation or in a specific sequential order. In general, patients begin with pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) to address overall short, tight pelvic floor muscles that are the hallmark finding on examination. Adjunctive therapy can include local trigger point injections, medical therapy, and sacral neuromodulation. Patients are also prescribed psychological counseling such as cognitive behavioral therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sex therapy to help reduce pain, manage symptoms, restore function, and reduce stress, if needed. Lastly, we aim to help the woman identify and avoid triggers that can cause symptom flares and support her when these flares occur.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost all women begin treatment with PFPT. While the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for myofascial pain at other sites is of unclear benefit, women can be treated with NSAIDs during times of flare. Although supporting data are lacking, some women find NSAID therapy helpful and those who experience no to minimal relief with NSAIDS can discontinue the medication. Women with moderate to severe symptoms (eg, interfering with daily activities or sleep) can also receive adjunctive medical therapy aimed at reducing their most bothersome symptom(s) (eg, sleep aid for women with disrupted sleep). The initial evaluation and treatment with PFPT and medical treatment typically requires three to four months, after which the patient is reassessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are unable to immediately attend PFPT, typically for logistic reasons or because of severe pain prohibiting PFPT, are offered trigger point injections or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> gel. Both can facilitate PFPT or help control symptoms while women are waiting to start PT. Occasionally, women with severe pelvic floor hypertonicity are offered pelvic floor Botox first. If PFPT is very painful, the physical therapist can start with external work only until the woman reaches a point where internal PT is possible. This is especially true of women who have had a history of abuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After three to four months of initial treatment, women who are notably improving with PFPT continue treatment until symptoms stabilize. The goal is to have the woman manage her symptoms with exercises or treatment that she can perform at home. For women taking concomitant medications, some are able to taper or stop their medical therapy once symptoms stabilize, while others need to continue these medications indefinitely due to return of pain when they taper or apprehension about stopping medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with minimal or no improvement are reassessed and may be referred for an orthopedic evaluation to assess for extra-pelvic sources of pain. These women may also be advised to try additional adjunctive medical therapy. If the pelvic floor remains hypertonic, we discuss the benefits and risks of Botox injections. Referral for evaluation and treatment of other bothersome symptoms (eg, depression or anxiety, difficulty with sleep) is recommended. In addition, these women can benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy or related treatments to help them manage their symptoms. We reassess these women every three to four months, and continue through this treatment loop, until symptoms are improved and function is restored to the greatest degree possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who are unable to access PFPT, we proceed with weekly to monthly (depending upon <span class=\"nowrap\">need/benefit)</span> trigger point injections, if indicated, and a combination of medical therapies and counseling.</p><p/><p>Once symptoms are manageable, we educate women to monitor for early signs of a flare and intervene quickly. Although there are limited data, we generally advise a quick return to physical therapy to prevent a long-term or more severe flare. However, even with early treatment, severe flares may occur and women may need to go through a new course of treatment and reevaluation for possible underlying pathology.</p><p>Management of MPPS can be viewed as long-term control of a chronic underlying predisposition. One challenge in assessing response is that symptoms can improve because of a true treatment effect, because the natural history of the disease includes improvement in symptoms over time, because of the Hawthorne effect (ie, improvement in symptoms simply because the patient is in a clinical trial), because the associated musculoskeletal process resolves, or some combination of these [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PELVIC FLOOR PHYSICAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary treatment of MPPS involves manual myofascial release, stretching, and strengthening of affected areas via pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT). Ideally, PFPT is performed by a physical therapist with specialized training in soft tissue manipulation and rehabilitation of the pelvis. The importance of finding an experienced pelvic floor physical therapist cannot be overemphasized. There is little benefit from physical therapy regimens that do not include internal vaginal release work in addition to external soft tissue manipulation and trigger point release. It is important that the patient not focus on tightening or strengthening the levator muscles (eg, Kegel exercises or electrical stimulation), as this can worsen symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-floor-physical-therapy-for-management-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic floor physical therapy for management of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During a treatment session, the patient lies in the supine position as the physical therapist works to manually release the trigger points and the restricted movement of the connective tissues and muscles of the vagina, abdomen, hips, thighs, lower back, and, in some cases, the rectum. Some therapists use other modalities, such as dry needling, to hasten the release of painful tissue around surgical scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The details of PFPT for the treatment of myofascial pain are presented separately.</p><p>Treatment sessions are usually 45 to 60 minutes and are scheduled once or twice per week for 8 to 12 weeks. Improvement can be apparent after as few as six sessions. However, in our experience, women with chronic pain often require more than 12 weeks of treatment, and some will require treatment up to one year or beyond. The duration of symptoms typically correlates with the time course for treatment (ie, women with symptoms of longer duration often require longer treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. After treatment is completed, follow-up sessions may be needed periodically to treat flares of pain. Flares can develop as a result of stress, injury, sexual activity, or other physical activity (eg, prolonged sitting).</p><p>If the patient has to travel a long distance to see a physical therapist, and remain overnight, setting up intensive physical therapy daily for a week (longer if needed) can be useful. Although self-treatment with vaginal dilators or a TheraWand is possible for some women, in our experience, these techniques tend to exacerbate pain early in treatment and do not replace proper myofascial release techniques. As an alternative, a physical therapist can educate the patient's partner about techniques that can be performed at home. For women with trigger points in deeper vaginal muscles, a willing partner may be able to provide hands-on treatment if an experienced therapist is not available locally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Data supporting PFPT are limited but are reassuring. In a trial that randomly assigned 81 women with interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/painful</span> bladder syndrome to either PFPT or global massage (control), women in the PFPT group had over twice the response rate compared with global massage (59 versus 26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, a small trial comparing PFPT and trigger point injections in women with pelvic floor myalgia reported a greater than 50 percent improvement in symptoms for each group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Two small prospective, observational studies of patients with bladder symptoms and a high tone pelvic floor provided some evidence of benefit from manual myofascial physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. Similarly, in a retrospective review of 146 women with myofascial pelvic pain who received transvaginal pelvic floor physical therapy, 63 percent of patients reported significant improvement in pain scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pain score improvement was proportional to the number of complete physical therapy visits. In contrast to myofascial physical therapy, at least one study has reported that global massage does not appear to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INJECTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Trigger point</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use trigger point injections (TPI) to facilitate physical therapy, as injections can improve tolerability for some women, and as short-acting relief for pain flares. Although the injections can be quite uncomfortable, MPPS-related pain is often completely relieved for some duration. As demonstrated with other muscle pain syndromes, TPIs can be useful as a diagnostic tool; if the patient's pain improves or resolves after injection, then MPPS is likely the cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A complete or significant response to a TPI is often a good prognostic indicator. TPIs have demonstrated efficacy in a variety of neuromuscular pain syndromes, including abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment, muscles and nerves of the pelvis (eg, obturator nerve, piriformis syndrome), sciatica, and headaches, although studies of MPPS are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. For women with chronic, severe symptoms, even temporary relief from pain can provide better understanding of the underlying process and motivation to follow through with treatment. We discuss with women that injections are not usually curative or as effective as physical therapy. However, a good response with decreased pain for an interval of time is often a good prognostic sign indicating that addressing the pelvic floor will be helpful in reducing the pain.</p><p>TPIs can be given by any health care provider who is familiar with pelvic floor anatomy, can assess for trigger points, and has received training in pudendal block injections. Although some gynecologists and urologists provide this procedure, specialists in Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) generally perform the most comprehensive evaluation for trigger points and are often able to inject deeper muscle groups. We locate trigger points by palpating the soft tissues of the pelvic floor and gently applying pressure to areas that feel firm or taut. Clinically, patients are often able to indicate which areas of the muscles are most painful and therefore require injection. Although some clinicians use electromyography or ultrasound to locate trigger points, these modalities do not appear to improve the efficacy of TPIs in studies of non-pelvic trigger points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Further studies are needed to determine if imaging or other modalities provide superior accuracy for TPIs.</p><p>The optimal medications and doses for TPIs are not known; mixtures of local anesthetics and glucocorticoids have been associated with reduced pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19</a>]. We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> alone because of its long duration of action and typically avoid glucocorticoids because of potential concerns for muscle wasting and infection associated with repeated injections. For most women, we inject 1 to 3 mL doses of 0.25 percent bupivacaine (maximum total volume 30 to 40 mL, depending on patient's weight) throughout the pelvic floor using a pudendal kit. Trigger points in the abdomen may also be injected, as needed, using a long (at least 1 inch) small gauge (27 g) needle. For select women with focal areas of burning pain near the introitus, we inject 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> for no more than three injections.</p><p>In addition to steroid injections, some experts use a pudendal block (10 mL of 0.25 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> injected 1 cm inferior to the right and left ischial spines) for temporary relief of myofascial pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. We do not generally use pudendal blocks since most patients get sufficient pain relief with TPIs, although we do also target the area of the pudendal nerve with 1 to 2 cc of Marcaine. Additionally, unlike pudendal blocks, several tender muscle groups are directly injected during TPIs based on palpation.</p><p>Duration of pain relief varies, with most patients having at least four hours of relief and some having relief for up to several days. If the injections are immediately followed by physical therapy (within one to two hours), the patient may note more soreness than when injections do not precede the therapy. This is because deeper physical therapy is possible when pain has been eliminated by the injections. Additionally, pain often occurs early in the course of physical therapy sessions before a patient's symptoms improve. Occasionally, a patient will have a flare of pain after the injections and experience no relief. We do not typically repeat injections in these women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Botulinum toxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the supporting data are limited and include other forms of neuropathic pain, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a> (BTXA) appears to be helpful for women with refractory myofascial pelvic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/20-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-29</a>]. We suggest botulinum toxin A injections for women who are unable to perform pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) due to severe pain, for women with persistent pain after six to eight sessions of PFPT, for women who are not making progress with PFPT, or for women with an identifiable muscle spasm that correlates with their symptoms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pilot study of BTXA in 12 women administered a total dose of 40 units of BTXA injected at three concentrations (10 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> 20 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> and 100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> at four points in the pelvic floor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Visual analogue scores for dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea improved significantly at 12 weeks, while there were non-significant reductions in non-menstrual pain and dyschezia. There were no significant differences in pain scores, quality of life, or pelvic floor pressure measurements between the three dilutions of BTXA. Quality of life scores were improved at 12 weeks, although this did not reach statistical significance. There were no reports of new onset urinary or fecal incontinence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial including 60 women reported that injections of a total dose of 80 units of BTXA (20 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> significantly reduced dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia-associated pain compared to injections of saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. BTXA reduced non-menstrual pelvic pain and dyschezia, although this did not reach statistical significance. There were no reports of new urinary or fecal incontinence or urinary retention, although two participants became pregnant; one woman delivered a healthy infant while the other woman's infant was born with a ventriculoseptal defect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several subsequent trials of BTXA have reported similar improvements in pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>], with some studies using up to 300 units of BTXA injected into multiple sites in the pelvic floor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p/><p>Prolonged muscle contraction, spasm, and inappropriately high muscle tone are hypothesized to diminish blood supply and increase oxygen demand of the muscles of the pelvic floor. Ischemic muscle may secrete pain-producing substances, which further sensitize muscle nociceptors, alter receptor field properties, and convert wide-band mechanoreceptors to nociceptors Although there are some data to support this theory, the true nature of this condition remains unknown and may in fact include multiple different etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. BTXA can directly block cholinergic neuromuscular transmission and interrupt the cascade of events that lead to hyperalgesia and allodynia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. BTXA plays a direct role by blocking the alpha- and gamma-motor neurons, thereby preventing the abnormal pattern of muscle contraction (eg, spasm, dystonia) that activates muscle nociceptors and sensitizes the muscle pain system through mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of botulinum toxin for treatment of non-neurogenic lower urinary tract conditions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-botulinum-toxin-for-treatment-of-non-neurogenic-lower-urinary-tract-conditions#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of botulinum toxin for treatment of non-neurogenic lower urinary tract conditions&quot;, section on 'Pharmacology'</a>.)</p><p>Prior to injection, we counsel patients extensively regarding risks of intrapelvic BTXA injections, including risk of incontinence, weakness, and the rare, but serious, risk of systemic complications. Our patients have reported transient flu-like symptoms, severe constipation (10 percent), urinary retention (5 percent), and fecal incontinence (&lt;1 percent). Others have developed bothersome vaginal or rectal pressure, despite resolution of vaginal pain. All of these side effects gradually resolved over approximately three months as the effects of BTXA wore off.</p><p>We inject 100 to 300 international units of BTXA. Each 100-unit vial is diluted in 10 mL of preservative-free saline, and 1 to 2 mL are injected into each palpable trigger point and tender area throughout the pelvic floor. The dose is based on severity as well as concern for side effects. Most patients tolerate the injections in the office setting, although the occasional patient requires sedation and injections in the operating room. Local application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> jelly before injection and ice packs after injection may be helpful for injection-related pain. Some women also request premedication with anxiolytics or pain medications for in-office injections.</p><p>Most patients begin to feel relief of pain within one to two weeks. Physical therapy and trigger point injections may be resumed one week after the BTXA injections. We use BTXA alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal bupivacaine</a>. Repeat injections of BTXA are considered if the first series of injections was effective and the woman did not have significant side effects, but should not be given sooner than 12 weeks after the previous BTXA injection. The manufacturer recommends no more than 400 units of BTXA (for any indication) per 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. We do not exceeded 300 units.</p><p>One potential limitation of BTXA treatment is its cost. Some commercial insurers in the United States do not cover the cost of the BTXA for treatment of MPPS, and the cost of self-payment ($550 to $700 per vial, with up to three vials needed) is prohibitive in many cases. In these cases, we recommend communicating with the insurer's medical director to advocate for the use of BTXA given the low risk, potential benefits, and limited alternatives to intrapelvic BTXA, especially in those women who have tried multiple other treatments without success.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3300944270\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, we do not typically inject glucocorticoids as a single agent into the pelvic floor. We prefer a <span class=\"nowrap\">glucocorticoid/local</span> anesthetic mixture (1 to 2 cc <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> with 1 to 3 cc <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> 0.25 percent), particularly for women with entry dyspareunia.

We prescribe gabapentin for women with moderate to severe pelvic or vaginal pain that is chronic and is interfering with sleep or the ability to perform normal daily activities. We initiate therapy with gabapentin 100 mg at bedtime and increase the dose as needed by 100 mg per week, up to 300 mg three times per day. Many women will have a symptom response at lower doses; we give women written instructions on how to slowly increase the dose until they feel relief. The dose may be increased further, depending upon the patient's symptoms and ability to tolerate side effects. The maximum tolerated dose in long-term clinical trials is 2400 mg per day in divided doses. It may take four to six weeks to observe an effect. The dose must be tapered over at least one week before it is discontinued.

TCAs are commonly prescribed (unlabeled use) for treatment of a variety of chronic pain states, with or without coexisting depression. While there are few data on the use of TCAs for treatment of myofascial pain, the available literature reports treatment benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Bothersome side effects (eg, anticholinergic effects, moderate to marked sedation) are a limiting factor.

While baclofen is more typically used in patients with neurologic spasticity, we have found baclofen helpful in alleviating pain in women with severe myofascial pain and hypertonic pelvic floor. While baclofen has been used to treat chronic pain syndromes, published reports of treatment of myofascial pain are lacking.

If a woman experiences a benefit from estrogen treatment, we do not discourage its use, although there are no supporting data. Estrogen can ameliorate vaginal irritation due to atrophic changes and may reduce vaginal pain and irritative voiding symptoms. For women with evidence of vulvovaginal atrophy, we prescribe vaginal (not systemic) estrogen, which is well tolerated and has minimal systemic effects. As some patients find estrogen creams to be irritating, we prescribe a 10 mcg tablet of vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a>, inserted into the vagina at night for two weeks, and then twice per week thereafter. We occasionally recommend increasing the dose to three times per week if insufficient effects are seen.

However, side effects such as forgetfulness, drowsiness, weight gain, lower extremity edema, and feeling foggy, loopy, or euphoric limit its use. Pregabalin can be given less frequently (twice daily) than gabapentin (usually three times daily), but side effects can be more troublesome and it has a small potential for abuse (schedule V drug).</p><p>We initiate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a> if moderate to high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> do not improve pain symptoms. Due to potentially bothersome side effects, we initiate treatment with a small dose, 25 mg at bedtime, and then slowly increase to 75 mg twice daily. It may take four to six weeks to observe an effect. Women who are tolerating the medication but not improving during four weeks of treatment can increase the dose (over one week) to 150 mg twice a day, and are again reassessed after four weeks of treatment at the increased dose. Higher doses (up to 450 mg per day) can be used if the medication is well-tolerated but symptoms are not adequately controlled. The drug should be tapered before it is discontinued.

We offer this combination to women who have moderate to severe pain that affects activities of daily living and who have failed treatment with gabapentin or pregabalin alone. Side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, can be a limiting factor. Starting with a low dose and titrating up slowly can improve tolerability.

Cymbalta is started at 30 mg once daily for one week, then increased to 60 mg once daily. If there is no improvement in pain within six to eight weeks, or if the patient develops bothersome side effects, the medication is slowly tapered over two to four weeks, then stopped.

However, for women who do not have access to a compounding pharmacy and are able to reliably use the medication only vaginally, we will prescribe diazepam tablets for vaginal insertion. One advantage is that the drug is minimally absorbed into the bloodstream from the vaginal route and thus is associated with fewer side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

However, studies of SNM for the treatment of MPPS are lacking. As sacral neuromodulation is an invasive procedure, we only use it for the subpopulation of women with painful bladder syndrome or refractory overactive bladder. In our experience, neuromodulation for urinary urgency and frequency in the setting of myofascial pain is sometimes effective to relieve pain but not enough to warrant its use in the absence of frequency and urgency. Additionally, even if there is a marked improvement of pain, there is often a gradual increase in pain and habituation to the stimulation, despite reprogramming. Therefore, we do not usually recommend sacral neuromodulation as an initial or long-term treatment of MPPS.

The review included studies in which one group was treated by needling directly into the myofascial trigger points, while a control group received no treatment, usual care, indirect local dry needling, or a placebo intervention. There was a trend toward treatment efficacy, but major differences in study design, quality, and size limited the ability to analyze combined data.

We generally recommend applying ice for no more than 20 minutes at a time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heat</strong> &ndash; For women who cannot tolerate ice, heat can also be soothing during a flare.

There is no single exercise proven to reduce pain or tightness related to MPPS. We suggest regimens that include stretching (eg, yoga, Pilates). Exercises to strengthen the core, pelvis, or both should be approached with care, as this can sometimes lead to increased pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stress management</strong> &ndash; Anxiety predisposes some women to continuously contract their muscles, including those of the pelvic floor. Depression and anxiety often coexist with chronic pain and may exacerbate pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This association has even been noted in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In our experience, uncontrolled anxiety and pain are associated with poorer outcomes and the need for a longer treatment course. Treatment must take depression and anxiety into account. It is important to include a multidisciplinary approach in these women, with the use of psychotherapy or psychopharmacology as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Use of stress reduction techniques such as deep breathing, visualization, mindfulness meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or prayer are suggested, as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reassess medical therapy</strong> &ndash; Women experiencing a flare may require additional medical support to help them through the episode. For example, we may prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> or benzodiazepines for women with muscle spasms, tricyclic antidepressants for women with sleep issues, and increase the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> for women who have previously been well controlled.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2098291074\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder pain or irritative voiding symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If painful or irritative voiding symptoms are manifested during a flare of MPPS, a bladder instillation of a local anesthetic and other medications can be helpful can be helpful &#160; A solution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, and heparin can provide short-term relief. In our practice, occasionally we also add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> to reduce presumed inflammation. Instillations are often done in the office, although patients can learn to administer the solution at home through self-catheterization.

However, long-term use of phenazopyridine is not recommended due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. Prior to use, t possibility of urinary tract infection should be excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women#H899949177\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome (MPPS) is a non-articular musculoskeletal pain disorder characterized by contracted bands of skeletal muscle that contain discrete, painful nodules, also called trigger points. MPPS is thought to originate at the trigger point, although the full etiology is not known. (See <a href=\"#H66154027\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One goal of treatment is to help women understand that MPPS can be a chronic, waxing and waning condition that may require long-term management. We apply a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both physiological and psychological aspects of MPPS and that is tailored to the individual patient. The general approach is to determine the trigger and then block or reduce ongoing stimuli that lead to pain. (See <a href=\"#H991531292\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with MPPS, we suggest initial treatment with pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The initial evaluation and treatment with PFPT and medical treatment typically requires three to four months, after which the patient is reassessed. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic floor physical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who are unable to immediately attend PFPT, typically because of severe pain prohibiting PFPT or for logistic reasons, we suggest trigger point injections (TPI) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). TPIs improve tolerability and enhance the response to physical therapy as well as often accelerate progress. An alternate approach for women who cannot access TPIs is treatment with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> gel. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Trigger point'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with moderate to severe myofascial pelvic pain that is interfering with their usual activities, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> as first-line pharmacologic therapy (in addition to pelvic floor physical therapy) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Additional first-line medication treatments include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, tricyclic antidepressants, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> because of their efficacy, tolerability, and relatively safe side-effect profile. This list reflects our experience as well as the available literature and is not meant to be applicable to all women with MPPS. (See <a href=\"#H3498675176\" class=\"local\">'Commonly used'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Gabapentin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After three to four months of initial treatment, women who are notably improving with PFPT continue treatment until symptoms stabilize. The goal is to have the woman manage her symptoms with exercises or treatment that she can perform at home. (See <a href=\"#H991531292\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who are unable to receive physical therapy due to severe pain, women with persistent pain after six to eight sessions of physical therapy, women who do not make progress with physical therapy, or for women with an identifiable muscle spasm that correlates with their pain symptoms, we suggest botulinum toxin A injections (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Botulinum toxin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women with minimal or no improvement are reassessed and may be referred for an orthopedic evaluation to assess for extra-pelvic sources of pain. These women may also be advised to try additional adjunctive medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H991531292\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most commonly used and studied psychological interventions for pain, including vulvar and sexual pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. We encourage patients to participate in a CBT program targeted at treatment of chronic pain syndromes for both symptom reduction and stress management. (See <a href=\"#H4245502044\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with MPPS often develop symptom recurrence months or even years after symptoms have quieted. Despite efforts to avoid known triggers, symptom flares can develop. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of flares'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Simons DG, Travell JG, Simons PT.
