It is not a specific diagnosis, but rather a &quot;chief complaint&quot; that brings an infant to medical attention. The clinical challenge is to identify the infants who may benefit from further testing and prolonged observation, based on factors that suggest an identifiable underlying diagnosis or risk for subsequent events, while avoiding unnecessary testing, monitoring, and hospital admission for the many other infants without these characteristics. </p><p>In the past, these events were termed &quot;apparent life-threatening events&quot; (ALTE). This term was broad and included a wide range of events and prognoses. Other previously used terms were &quot;near-miss sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)&quot; or &quot;aborted crib deaths,&quot; which were discarded because they incorrectly implied a direct association between these symptoms and SIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>A majority of these events are more precisely described as a &quot;brief resolved unexplained event&quot; (BRUE). This term was defined by consensus in 2016 and should be used instead of ALTE whenever the event is transient and remains unexplained after an appropriate medical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most but not all infants with BRUE are at low risk for recurrence or for having a serious underlying problem. &#160;</p><p>Because of the diverse presentations, causes, and prognoses of infants presenting with acute events, evaluation and management should be individualized. This topic review outlines the primary diagnostic considerations and a stepwise plan for evaluating infants presenting with this chief complaint. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1304118549\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3425136435\"><span class=\"h2\">Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BRUE is not a specific diagnosis but a description of a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode in an infant that includes one or more of the following features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108136 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyanosis or pallor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered level of responsiveness</p><p/><p>The term should be applied only when the infant is asymptomatic on presentation, and when there is no explanation for the episode after a focused history and physical examination.

The term BRUE should be used instead of ALTE whenever possible (ie, when episodes are brief, resolved, and unexplained). For events that do not fit the definition of BRUE, guidelines encourage the use of event characteristics rather than the term &quot;ALTE&quot; to describe the event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>In this topic review, we will use ALTE when describing literature that used the broader definition, and &quot;acute event&quot; for the chief complaint prior to determination of whether it meets the definition of BRUE. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the incidence of BRUE in infants are not available because most available studies focused on the broader and imprecisely defined category of apparent life-threatening event (ALTE); such studies estimated that ALTEs occur in 3:10,000 to 41:10,000 infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. The wide range of prevalence probably represents different stringencies in the definition of ALTE and different case-finding strategies. </p><p>The main risk factors for acute events in infants described as BRUE or ALTE are feeding difficulties, recent upper respiratory symptoms, and age younger than two months, or a history of previous episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/4,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,11</a>]. Lesser risk factors include premature birth or low birthweight and maternal smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Some studies also report that the rate of ALTE is higher among post-mature infants or first-born infants, as compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In older studies focusing on the broad category of ALTE, the most commonly identified explanatory diagnoses included gastroesophageal reflux, neurologic problems (such as seizures), and respiratory infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, it is likely that the distribution of explanatory diagnoses will change with implementation of the narrower diagnostic category BRUE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of an infant who has experienced BRUE is a focused history and physical examination. This information helps to identify infants who are at low risk for having a serious underlying disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108136 \">table 1</a>); such infants require minimal additional workup or observation. (See <a href=\"#H315925996\" class=\"local\">'Management of low-risk BRUE'</a> below.)</p><p>The history and physical examination may also identify features that suggest a specific cause of the event (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">choking/laryngospasm</span> or an upper respiratory tract infection) or characteristics that suggest a higher risk for having a serious underlying disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51356\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51356 \">table 2</a>). The clinical evaluation is supplemented by targeted testing in selected patients. </p><p>The importance of the focused history and physical examination was illustrated in a series of infants admitted to a tertiary center with apparent life-threatening event (ALTE). The cause of the event was diagnosed on the basis of the history and physical examination alone in 21 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The diagnosis was confirmed with testing prompted by the history and physical examination in an additional 49 percent. Eighteen percent of all tests ordered were positive and only 6 percent contributed to the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important diagnostic tool is a detailed description of the event and intervention obtained from the caretaker who witnessed the episode and any emergency personnel involved in the case. The key elements in the history are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54418 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>The history should include information about any previous apneic events, recent illnesses or symptoms, the pregnancy and perinatal period, the infant's usual behavior, sleep and feeding habits, a family history (including a history of siblings with similar episodes, sudden deaths, early deaths, genetic, metabolic, cardiac, and neurologic problems), a social history (including the presence of smoking, alcohol or substance use in the home, and a list of medications in the home) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The family should be asked specifically about the possibility of accidental or intentional administration of poisons or medications, including over-the-counter cold preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Features that suggest that the event was caused by gastroesophageal reflux (GER) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laryngospasm include gross emesis or oral regurgitation that occurred at the time of the event, and that the episode was characterized by obstructive apnea (ie, that the infant was making respiratory efforts but not successfully breathing). Acute events caused by laryngospasm typically occur during feeding, or shortly after feeding, especially if the infant is in a supine position. In an otherwise healthy infant, the presence of these features is reassuring because they suggest that the event was caused by choking, gagging, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laryngospasm, which are common and not life-threatening. If the events are recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the infant has underlying neurologic or developmental abnormalities, further evaluation for swallowing dysfunction may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H55450695\" class=\"local\">'Gastroesophageal reflux or swallowing dysfunction'</a> below.) </p><p>A respiratory tract infection should be suspected based on symptoms (eg, history of nasal congestion, cough, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever). Features suggestive of seizures include loss of muscle tone and unresponsiveness during the episode, and no history of choking or gagging. (See <a href=\"#H694585263\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory infection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2715307500\" class=\"local\">'Epilepsy or central nervous system disorder'</a> below.) </p><p>A history of previous episodes of severe events should particularly prompt consideration of child abuse, especially if the events occurred in the presence of a single caretaker and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A history of acute events or unexplained death in siblings or a prior report for child maltreatment also raises this concern. Child abuse may involve intentional suffocation, abusive head trauma, or factitious illness. (See <a href=\"#H2275975878\" class=\"local\">'Child abuse'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants presenting with a BRUE should undergo careful physical examination, with particular attention to abnormalities in the neurologic, respiratory, and cardiac systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H694585263\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory infection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In particular, the clinician should educate the family that there is no known association between BRUE (with low-risk characteristics) and the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). It is reasonable to use this opportunity to remind the family of the routine measures that they should take to minimize the risk of SIDS, such as ensuring that the infant sleeps in a supine position with face free, and in a safe sleeping environment (avoiding adult or loose bedding, excessive clothing, extreme room temperatures), and eliminating prenatal and postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Parents should be specifically advised not to shake the infant in an effort to &quot;resuscitate&quot; him or her [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

If there are clinical features that suggest a specific diagnosis (eg, upper respiratory tract infection or child abuse), the evaluation may be targeted toward that concern. If there are no clinical features suggesting a specific diagnosis, a general screening evaluation usually (but not necessarily) includes a complete blood count, urinalysis, plasma concentrations of glucose, electrolytes, calcium and magnesium, blood urea nitrogen, a chest radiograph, and an electrocardiogram. In addition, particularly if the infant has a change in sensorium, the evaluation should include a focused history and laboratory screening to detect accidental or intentional ingestions of poisons or medications, including over-the-counter cold preparations and ethanol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>].

Moreover, the case definition in ALTE (or BRUE) depends upon parental observations, which have been shown to be unreliable in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/55-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The term BRUE should be used instead of ALTE whenever possible (ie, when episodes are brief, resolved, and unexplained). For events that do not fit the definition of BRUE, guidelines encourage the use of event characteristics rather than the term ALTE to describe the event. (See <a href=\"#H2251309714\" class=\"local\">'Apparent life-threatening event (ALTE)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of an infant who has experienced BRUE is a focused history and physical examination. The history includes a detailed description of the event by the caretaker who witnessed the episode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54418 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This information helps to identify infants who are at <strong>low risk</strong> for recurrence or for having a serious underlying disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108136 \">table 1</a>). Such infants require minimal additional workup or observation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108710\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108710 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H257798136\" class=\"local\">'Low risk BRUE'</a> above and <a href=\"#H315925996\" class=\"local\">'Management of low-risk BRUE'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history and physical examination also identify features that suggest a specific cause of the event (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">choking/laryngospasm</span> or an upper respiratory tract infection) or characteristics that suggest a higher risk for having a serious underlying disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51356\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51356 \">table 2</a>). Further workup depends upon the suspected disorder. (See <a href=\"#H3547546552\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis and evaluation of infants at higher risk'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warning signs indicating that the event was medically significant and may have a specific pathologic cause include (see <a href=\"#H316631592\" class=\"local\">'Warning signs'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of prior acute event in this patient (especially within the past 24 hours), or of an acute event or unexplained death in a sibling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptoms at the time of evaluation (toxic appearance, lethargy, fever, unexplained recurrent vomiting, or respiratory distress).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Examination revealing bruising or any other evidence of trauma, dysmorphic features, congenital anomalies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> known syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant physiologic compromise during the event, based on a detailed description by the caretaker. This may include generalized sustained cyanosis, loss of consciousness, or need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by caretaker or trained CPR provider (more than mere stimulation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with warning signs should be admitted to the hospital for observation, and additional evaluation performed as guided by the history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51356\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51356 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H316634150\" class=\"local\">'Disposition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Targeted evaluation for specific disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in infants with acute events is uncertain. When an episode of GER appears to have immediately preceded the acute event, the direct cause of the respiratory event is probably laryngospasm. The GER may have triggered the laryngospasm, but this does not mean that the infant has an abnormal degree of GER or that treatment of reflux will prevent similar events in the future. Laryngospasm also may occur during feeding in the absence of GER. (See <a href=\"#H55450695\" class=\"local\">'Gastroesophageal reflux or swallowing dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possibility of child abuse should be considered when an infant suffers recurrent, severe BRUE-like events requiring CPR that occur only in the presence of a single caretaker, and a thorough diagnostic evaluation reveals no reasonable explanation for these dramatic repetitive events. (See <a href=\"#H2275975878\" class=\"local\">'Child abuse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BRUE and ALTEs are not considered a precursor to, or risk factor for, SIDS. The vast majority of SIDS victims do not experience apnea prior to death, and the epidemiology and risk factors for SIDS are very different from those for BRUE and ALTE. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Infantile Apnea and Home Monitoring, Sept 29 to Oct 1, 1986.
