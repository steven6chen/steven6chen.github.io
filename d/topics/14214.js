Limited data from small trials are available to guide prevention and management of cardiotoxicity. </p><p>Based on the limited data available and our clinical experience, we suggest the following approach. All patients should receive a baseline clinical cardiovascular assessment, including physical examination and an echocardiogram prior to initiation of anthracyclines. Although guidelines have not included baseline electrocardiogram in their recommendations, some UpToDate contributors find it helpful to obtain a baseline electrocardiogram to compare with future studies, in the event of new-onset cardiac signs or symptoms. </p><p>The decision to use an anthracycline is based on the baseline cardiac function, overall health status, and the availability of equivalent non-anthracycline-based alternative regimens. The baseline assessment is also used to identify patients proceeding with anthracycline therapy who should receive neurohormonal inhibition.

However, decisions in this regard should be individualized, and factors including the availability of other therapeutic options as well as the projected benefit (percent increase in cure rate, or absolute improvement in median survival) should be considered.

This includes optimizing management of hypertension, preexisting HF, and other cardiac conditions (eg, angina), and metabolic disorders as well as counseling regarding smoking cessation, weight loss, and physical activity when possible. Risk stratification using biomarkers or echocardiographic data may help identify patients who benefit from a cardioprotective approach, though the impact of such strategies on clinical outcomes has not been established, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H393471109\" class=\"local\">'Cardioprotective strategies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3045623246\"><span class=\"h2\">Modification of anthracycline chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may consider non-anthracycline alternatives that are, in many cases, equally efficacious or close to equally efficacious. For example, in breast cancer the adjuvant regimen <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> effectively reduces the risk of recurrence. These regimens are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer#H31949206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Choosing a regimen'</a>.)</p><p>The risk of anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity should be weighed against the potential benefits of anthracycline chemotherapy given the patients' prognosis and likely clinical benefit.&nbsp;For example, the risk of HF with standard regimens for breast cancer, the most common use of anthracycline in solid tumors, is typically less than 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, in a patient with normal baseline cardiac function, the benefits of anthracycline likely outweigh the risk for patients with appropriate indications. However, some patients with HF, low baseline LVEF, or significant heart disease will not be appropriate for anthracyclines.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of cardiotoxicity has long been recognized to correlate with the cumulative anthracycline dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109645 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. For patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, we generally limit the lifetime dose to 450 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> although higher doses may be delivered on an individualized basis, particularly for those being treated with anthracyclines to induce a remission who have not developed HF or a significant decline in EF. For patients who may be treated with multiple anthracycline agents, the fraction of allowable lifetime anthracycline dose contributed by each agent is calculated and summed when determining whether further anthracyclines are contraindicated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few high-quality studies on whether anthracycline dose modification offers cardiac protection with equal efficacy. Therefore, for patients&nbsp;with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, we often opt for a non-anthracycline-based regimen if one exists rather than dose reduction of an anthracycline-containing regimen. For example, in breast cancer, multiple non-anthracycline-based adjuvant regimens exist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-systemic-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer#H1352264107\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Nonanthracycline-based therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer#H375568921\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Acceptable alternatives to anthracycline-based treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cardioprotective strategy that has been employed in hematologic malignancies and in certain sarcoma protocols is infusional rather than bolus dosing of anthracycline; for example, with 24-hour dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> through a central venous catheter in the EPOCH chemotherapy regimen. Infusional dosing has also demonstrated low rates of HF in breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], although it is not typically used given that it requires an indwelling catheter and the fact that the cumulative doses of anthracycline exposure in breast cancer are typically low (240 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Evidence for the cardioprotective effect of infusional dosing comes from a meta-analysis including seven studies with different infusion durations. Among a total of 803 participants, the risk of HF (risk ratio 0.27, 95% CI 0.09-0.81) and subclinical evidence of cardiotoxicity (risk ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.90) was reduced with longer-duration infusion compared with more rapid infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. No significant difference in cancer response rate was observed on analysis of the two studies that included response rate data. Early studies demonstrated that prolonging infusion times over 48 to 96 hours resulted in less injury to the myocardium on endomyocardial biopsy, less clinical HF, and preserved antitumor responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In adult patients, slower infusion of anthracyclines lowers the peak plasma level (C<sub>max</sub>), which correlates with the propensity to develop cardiotoxicity, but it does not affect the area under the curve, which correlates with antitumor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are likely to need high cumulative doses of anthracyclines, a liposomal formulation of anthracycline may limit cardiotoxicity. For example, liposomal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> is United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for metastatic breast cancer, <span class=\"nowrap\">advanced/refractory</span> ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, and AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma. These agents preferentially enter and accumulate in malignant tissues as a result of the tumor&rsquo;s leaky microvasculature and impaired lymphatics, whereas drug extravasation into cardiomyocytes in the heart is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Several clinical trials have confirmed comparable or nearly comparable antitumor efficacy and reduced cardiotoxicity observed with liposomal formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. However, compared with traditional anthracyclines, the use of liposomal formulations has been associated with an increased risk of mucositis and hand-foot syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p>While it has long been thought that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epirubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epirubicin</a> confers a lower risk of cardiotoxicity compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], this is likely only true on a mg-for-mg basis. Most regimens employ a higher dose of epirubicin than doxorubicin, and therefore there are no clinical differences in safety or efficacy between the two agents. A Cochrane review demonstrated no difference between epirubicin and doxorubicin with regard to the development of clinical heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H393471109\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardioprotective strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest cardioprotective therapy to patients with preexisting mild LV dysfunction (LVEF 40 to 49 percent).

However, clinical trials have been small and frequently relied upon the surrogate endpoints such as change in LVEF. While these interventions are not routinely indicated as preventive measures for patients who lack cardiac risk factors or disease, they may be appropriate for select patients, as discussed elsewhere. Further indications for patients who develop HF are discussed below.

Initial trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nebivolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nebivolol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] have suggested a benefit, though subsequent larger trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. It is unclear whether the positive effects seen with carvedilol and nebivolol are an artifact of the small sample sizes of these studies or whether they represent true differences in biologic action compared with metoprolol. In particular, carvedilol has been proposed to attenuate anthracycline-mediated cardiac injury by mitigating oxidative stress, preventing mitochondrial dysfunction, and maintaining calcium homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Prior to routine incorporation of beta blockade into primary prevention strategies for anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity, larger randomized, controlled trials are needed to determine if cardioprotection is a class effect of beta blockers and to examine efficacy and safety in the cancer patient population. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2243297820\"><span class=\"h4\">Angiotensin inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While large, randomized trials support the use of ACE inhibitor or ARB in treatment of HFrEF, only a few small studies are available on the use of either agent for primary prevention of anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity.

These treatments should be started as soon as an LVEF &lt;50 percent is detected, ideally within six months after completion of anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

Eleven percent of the patients totally recovered a normal LVEF and 71 percent of the patients improved their LVEF by more than 5 percent.
