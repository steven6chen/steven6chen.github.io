Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT; previously called symptomatic porphyria, chemical porphyria, toxic porphyria) is the most common and the most readily treated of the porphyrias.</p><p>This topic review discusses the management and prognosis of PCT, a cutaneous porphyria (acquired or inherited) caused by deficient activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) in the liver, and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), an extremely rare condition caused by biallelic <em>UROD</em> mutation.

Patients should be informed that PCT is a readily treated, nonfatal condition and that most who inherit a uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (<em>UROD</em>) mutation (found in approximately 20 percent of individuals with PCT) will never develop symptoms.</p><p>Phlebotomy and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> are both highly effective and considered standard of care for treatment of PCT. These are also highly specific for PCT and are not effective for any other type of porphyria. All patients with PCT and active skin lesions who can tolerate phlebotomy or low-dose hydroxychloroquine should have one of these therapies in addition to reducing modifiable susceptibility factors. Whether patients with PCT and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection should be treated with direct-acting antiviral agents rather than these standard treatments is under study. (See <a href=\"#H514817\" class=\"local\">'Primary therapies for PCT'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional management considerations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to identify and minimize the effect of susceptibility factors, which are multiple and vary from patient to patient. These include use of alcohol and estrogen, smoking, chronic HCV infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and <em>UROD</em> and <em>HFE</em> (hereditary hemochromatosis gene) mutations. Early involvement of a hepatologist is advisable because PCT is a liver disease and many of the associated susceptibility factors affect the liver. (See <a href=\"#H515998\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of HCV and HIV infection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H515782\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of susceptibility factors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin protection from sunlight is important until porphyrin levels have normalized. Patients may not appreciate that the skin manifestations are due to sun exposure. Wearing cloth gloves, broad-brimmed hats, long trousers, and shoes is advised. Some skin fragility and blistering may continue after porphyrin levels are normal, probably due to slow healing of previously damaged skin that remains friable. (See <a href=\"#H515755\" class=\"local\">'Skin protection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic counseling may also be appropriate in families with <em>UROD</em> or <em>HFE</em> mutations or suspected familial inheritance. For patients with isolated porphyrin elevations in the setting of a heterozygous <em>UROD</em> mutation (ie, asymptomatic carriers), we do not use interventions or monitoring other than reduction of behavioral susceptibility factors. (See <a href=\"#H516494\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling and asymptomatic carrier management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the exceedingly rare patient with HEP, the only intervention known to be reliably effective is avoidance of sun exposure. However, PCT-related susceptibility factors may play a role in some patients and should be evaluated. (See <a href=\"#H516337\" class=\"local\">'HEP management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Most patients do not relapse after treatment, especially after susceptibility factors are addressed (see <a href=\"#H516739\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below). <span class=\"nowrap\">If/when</span> PCT does recur, it can be effectively treated in the same manner. For selected patients, re-treatment may be based on porphyrin elevations as an early sign of recurrence rather than waiting for skin lesions to develop.</p><p>Iron chelation is much less efficient for removing iron than is phlebotomy, and studies have not documented success comparable to phlebotomy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>) in treating PCT. Thus, chelation is only used for individuals with PCT and substantial iron overload who cannot tolerate phlebotomies or who have poor venous access (see <a href=\"#H516203\" class=\"local\">'Iron chelation'</a> below). Evidence is also lacking for efficacy of other treatments such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, plasmapheresis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>, N-acetylcysteine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anastrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anastrozole</a>, urinary alkalization, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. These should not be considered alternatives to phlebotomy or low-dose hydroxychloroquine.

In type 2 familial PCT, erythrocyte UROD activity will be approximately half-normal and a familial <em>UROD </em>mutation can be identified.

Repeated phlebotomy and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> are both considered effective primary therapy for PCT and are almost always able to produce a complete remission. Although controlled trials are lacking, either of these treatments appears to result in faster improvements than removal of susceptibility factors (eg, discontinuation of alcohol) alone. (See <a href=\"#H515782\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of susceptibility factors'</a> below.)</p><p>The choice between phlebotomy and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> is based on clinical features, including susceptibility factors and the degree of iron overload, along with patient preference. Most patients can be treated with either phlebotomy or hydroxychloroquine, but they may prefer one therapy over the other. Phlebotomy is preferred at most centers based on greater experience. Phlebotomy is clearly preferred for individuals with evidence of iron overload (eg, substantially elevated serum ferritin or<em> HFE</em>-related hemochromatosis). Hydroxychloroquine may be contraindicated with advanced liver disease, regular use of alcohol or hepatotoxic drugs, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, psoriasis, retinal disease (unless cleared by an ophthalmologist), and end-stage renal disease. There are also major differences in the cost, convenience, and side effects of these treatments. (See <a href=\"#H514912\" class=\"local\">'Phlebotomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H515353\" class=\"local\">'Hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine)'</a> below.)</p><p>For individuals with a <em>UROD</em> mutation and isolated porphyrin elevation without active skin lesions, we reduce susceptibility factors but do not use other interventions. (See <a href=\"#H516494\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling and asymptomatic carrier management'</a> below.)</p><p>Phlebotomy and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> were compared in a prospective pilot study involving 48 consecutive patients with PCT, which found that time needed to normalize plasma porphyrin levels, which predicts clinical improvement, was similar for both treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this study, patients underwent phlebotomy (one unit of blood every two weeks) or treatment with low-dose hydroxychloroquine (100 mg twice a week). Only 21 patients were eligible and willing to consider both treatments, and these patients were randomly assigned to one or the other treatment. Clinical features were comparable in both treatment groups.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Time to achieving a normal plasma porphyrin concentration in 30 evaluable patients was similar at 6.9 months for phlebotomy and 6.1 months for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>. Normalization of plasma porphyrin levels rather than skin findings was used to define remission because resolution of skin lesions was highly variable and difficult to assess.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Costs were lower and compliance was better with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>.</p><p/><p>With both therapies, a longer time is needed to normalize urine porphyrins and reverse the predominance of highly carboxylated porphyrins in urine; healing of skin lesions and resolution of skin fragility occur more slowly. Larger studies are needed to compare these therapies in terms of time to achieving remission, compliance, and cost. Studies comparing recurrence rates after each of these treatments and according to various susceptibility factors are underway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H514912\"><span class=\"h2\">Phlebotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phlebotomy is appealing because PCT is an iron-related disorder, and iron depletion presumably prevents formation of the uroporphomethene UROD inhibitor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H88983403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'UROD inhibitor'</a>.)</p><p>Repeated phlebotomy is highly effective for treating PCT both in patients with iron overload and those with normal iron stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phlebotomy is clearly preferred in patients with substantial iron overload, as indicated by a serum ferritin that exceeds approximately 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> or with homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for <em>HFE</em> mutations, since iron overload can cause other health issues. Importantly, iron reduction is not effective for treating other porphyrias; thus, it is important before starting treatment that the diagnosis of PCT is confirmed and other porphyrias are excluded (eg, variegate porphyria [VP], hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], mild cases of congenital erythropoietic porphyria [CEP], and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria [HEP]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2866979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2867411\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phlebotomy is also an appropriate choice for patients with normal serum ferritin, serum ferritin below approximately 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL,</span> heterozygosity for an <em>HFE</em> mutation, or no <em>HFE</em> mutation, as is low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H515353\" class=\"local\">'Hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>We initiate phlebotomy, with removal of one unit of whole blood (approximately 450 mL) at intervals of approximately every two weeks, with monitoring of serum ferritin and hemoglobin (Hgb) levels (see <a href=\"#H515697\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below). Phlebotomy is performed until the serum ferritin is reduced to approximately &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (the lower limit of normal). Phlebotomy can also be stopped if the ferritin was less than approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> when drawn two weeks previously. Phlebotomy is deferred and rescheduled for an Hgb below a level that is preset for each patient. The preset Hgb level depends on the starting Hgb level and an assessment of other health conditions that might be adversely affected by lowering the Hgb level. This approach leads to remission of PCT while avoiding development of symptomatic anemia.</p><p>Lack of response to phlebotomy despite an adequate reduction in serum ferritin is rare. Most patients will require only six to eight phlebotomies to reach the target ferritin level because severe iron overload is not common in PCT. Once the target ferritin level is reached, phlebotomy is discontinued, even if skin lesions and <span class=\"nowrap\">plasma/urinary</span> porphyrin elevations persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The large amounts of porphyrins in the liver are gradually mobilized and excreted, and porphyrin levels will continue to decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation also improve gradually. Pseudo-sclerodermatous skin changes improve in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Improvement in liver function and histology are reported but are inconsistent, reflecting the role of commonly associated susceptibility factors that also cause liver damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Following remission, continued phlebotomies are usually not needed unless the patient&rsquo;s <em>HFE</em> genotype is <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/C282Y</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/H63D,</span> in which case phlebotomies should be repeated often enough to keep the ferritin below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Maintenance'</a>). Phlebotomy can be reinitiated if porphyrin levels become elevated. For a patient who has frequent recurrences of PCT, limited experience suggests that keeping the ferritin level below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> may prevent further recurrences.</p><p>Advantages of phlebotomy include proven efficacy based on uncontrolled observations over many decades and a strong rationale for treating an iron-related disease. However, phlebotomy may be expensive, inconvenient, and uncomfortable, and it may cause syncope or anemia in some patients. As a result, compliance with phlebotomy is challenging for many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Patients with end-stage renal disease who have PCT in the setting of anemia may benefit from stopping iron supplementation and erythropoietin administration or an increase in erythropoietin dose to increase erythropoiesis and support therapeutic phlebotomy to reduce excess iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

Patients with marked iron overload or <em>HFE</em>-related hemochromatosis should be treated by phlebotomy rather than hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. In addition, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine should not be used to treat PCT in patients with end-stage renal disease because mobilized porphyrins are poorly dialyzed.</p><p>A retrospective review suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> was not effective for treating PCT in individuals with homozygosity for the C282Y <em>HFE</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

All others with PCT responded with sustained resolution of skin lesions, including nine C282Y heterozygotes, 18 H63D homozygotes, eight <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/H63D</span> compound heterozygotes, and 24 patients without an <em>HFE</em> mutation.</p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> in PCT has an interesting history. It was noted initially that the larger doses of these drugs used for other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis may, when administered in patients who also have PCT, induce fever, malaise, nausea, and marked increases in urinary uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyl porphyrin, plasma porphyrins, serum transaminases, other liver function tests, and ferritin levels. A usual dose of chloroquine for malaria prophylaxis can unmask previously unrecognized PCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

The dose-related acute increases in porphyrin levels and cutaneous manifestations of PCT are manifestations of acute hepatic damage and the release of large amounts of porphyrins stored in hepatocytes. These drugs are weak bases and are mostly taken up in hepatocytes and especially in lysosomes, where excess porphyrins are stored in PCT. They may lower hepatocyte iron uptake but do not lower ferritin levels significantly, so they do not appear to act by causing iron depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Subsequently, it was found that a low-dose regimen was preferred compared with standard doses because porphyrins are mobilized from the liver more gradually with little increase in plasma porphyrins or hepatocellular damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515697\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is monitored by measuring serum ferritin (during phlebotomies) and plasma porphyrins (during both treatments).

Monitoring of ferritin is not helpful during treatment with hydroxychloroquine; even low-dose hydroxychloroquine may cause transient hepatocellular damage accompanied by an acute phase response and a transient increase in ferritin. Ophthalmologic monitoring is described above.

PCT can be familial or sporadic (approximately 20 and 80 percent of cases, respectively). In both familial and sporadic disease, acquired susceptibility factors such as alcohol use, smoking, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are common. Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and the diagnostic evaluation for PCT and HEP are presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCT is the most readily treated type of porphyria. Phlebotomy and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> are both highly effective and considered standard of care for treatment of PCT. These are also highly specific for PCT and are not effective for any other type of porphyria. (See <a href=\"#H514456\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals diagnosed with PCT should have baseline complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count; serum ferritin, chemistries, tests of renal and hepatic function; testing for HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections; and testing for <em>UROD</em> and <em>HFE</em> (the hereditary hemochromatosis [HH] gene) mutations. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is appropriate after age 50 years or in any patient with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H514692\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing once diagnosis is established'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PCT who have active skin lesions should be treated with a primary therapy (either phlebotomy or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>) in addition to reducing any susceptibility factors (see <a href=\"#H514817\" class=\"local\">'Primary therapies for PCT'</a> above). The choice between phlebotomy and hydroxychloroquine depends on the degree of iron overload and other factors:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Phlebotomy is clearly preferred for individuals with substantial iron overload, as indicated by a serum ferritin that exceeds approximately 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> or with homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for <em>HFE</em> mutations. Phlebotomy is performed every two weeks, guided by the serum ferritin and porphyrin levels. After remission, continued phlebotomies usually are not required, but guidelines for managing HH should be followed for patients with HH. Repeated recurrences may be prevented by periodic phlebotomy. (See <a href=\"#H514912\" class=\"local\">'Phlebotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Individuals who do not have substantial iron overload may be treated with phlebotomy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>. The choice between these is based on other susceptibility factors, contraindications to either treatment, and other factors that may affect preference (eg, cost, convenience, side effect profile). Contraindications to the use of hydroxychloroquine including pregnancy, advanced liver disease, regular alcohol use, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and retinal disease are listed above. After ophthalmological clearance, hydroxychloroquine is administered 100 mg twice weekly, with measurement of porphyrin levels. Recurrences can be re-treated with hydroxychloroquine; however, long-term administration during remission is not advisable. (See <a href=\"#H514912\" class=\"local\">'Phlebotomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H515353\" class=\"local\">'Hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most patients do not have relapse of PCT after treatment, especially when susceptibility factors are addressed. However, re-treatment for early recurrence of PCT based on porphyrin elevations may be appropriate for some individuals rather than waiting for skin lesions to develop. (See <a href=\"#H514456\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For an asymptomatic <em>UROD</em> mutation carrier identified by family testing, we reduce susceptibility factors. A primary therapy is unlikely to be needed unless active skin lesions have occurred in the past. (See <a href=\"#H516494\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling and asymptomatic carrier management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sun avoidance is used until plasma porphyrin levels have normalized. Alcohol, smoking, excess iron intake, and exogenous estrogens should be avoided. Drugs known to exacerbate acute porphyrias are seldom reported to precipitate PCT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57422 \">table 1</a>); however, they should be avoided when possible. (See <a href=\"#H515755\" class=\"local\">'Skin protection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H515782\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of susceptibility factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy for HCV infection should be delayed until PCT is in remission. However, studies with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents are underway to determine whether these drugs should be used instead of phlebotomy and low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> in HCV-infected PCT patients. If present, HIV infection should be treated concurrently with PCT. (See <a href=\"#H515998\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of HCV and HIV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For HEP, management consists of protection from sunlight. In contrast to PCT, reduction of hepatic iron does not appear to be effective in managing HEP. (See <a href=\"#H516337\" class=\"local\">'HEP management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic counseling in families with a known <em>UROD</em> mutation or suspected familial inheritance can be used to provide information about appropriate testing of family members for susceptibility factors and likelihood of PCT in children. For individuals or families with HEP, genetic and reproductive counseling may be more complex. (See <a href=\"#H516494\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling and asymptomatic carrier management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Life expectancy for patients with PCT is expected to be normal in the absence of advanced liver disease or hepatocellular cancer. However, susceptibility factors (eg, alcohol use, HCV infection, smoking) can limit longevity.
