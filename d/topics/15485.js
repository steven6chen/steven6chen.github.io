Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes according to two surface antigens: the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens, which determine influenza nomenclature (eg, H1N1, H3N2, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Influenza C viruses also may cause influenza infection, particularly in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Although the prevalence of influenza C usually is lower than that of influenza A or B, influenza C epidemics may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The epidemiologic pattern reflects changes in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface proteins (ie, antigenic shifts or drifts). The subsequent spread, duration, and severity of the outbreak depend upon the susceptibility of the population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of influenza&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Influenza activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) monitor influenza activity throughout the world. Surveillance information, updated regularly during influenza season, is available from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnscrmdVE8KqbZXnK0TNI43fBxhAlYVsMF4eMQkm9n0mZ9&amp;TOPIC_ID=5973\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/flunet/en/&amp;token=CGrU2PnO7/NB7T04m20ugL+6jdzA2yxocdZIhOWpbUmeklKZaxtyTBt7vt1TWK1kpx+DYvhNdlx9W+j3n5nJFA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5973\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">WHO</a>.

However, sneezing and coughing are not necessary for transmission. Influenza also may be spread by small particle aerosols that are released into the air during breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].

This means that patients can be contagious before the onset of symptoms and for several days after. Longer periods of shedding can occur in immunocompromised hosts and young children, especially those with primary infection, due to the relative lack of immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of shedding varies from patient to patient and appears to correlate with symptoms and severity of illness, particularly with influenza A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/seasonal-influenza-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,16,18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16,18,23</a>].

However, classic features may be absent in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50643\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50643 \">table 2</a>).

In addition, secondary bacterial coinfection (pneumonia or bacteremia), most commonly due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> or<em> Staphylococcus aureus</em>, may occur in children with or without high-risk conditions. Pneumonia coinfection with influenza and <em>S. pneumoniae</em> or <em>S. aureus</em> may be particularly severe and rapidly fatal.

The approach to testing depends upon test availability and how soon the results are needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69655 \">table 3</a>). If available, we prefer molecular assays (eg, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or rapid molecular assays) to antigen detection tests. Antigen detection tests (eg, direct and indirect immunofluorescence assays, traditional rapid influenza diagnostic tests) may be used if molecular assays are not available. Although digital immunoassays appear to have sensitivity approaching that of molecular tests and are commercially available, additional clinical experience is necessary to confirm their utility at the point of care. During periods of increased influenza activity, patients with negative antigen detection tests may warrant confirmation with molecular assays or viral culture.
