The hemodialysis procedure itself may adversely affect nutritional status by causing amino acid and albumin losses and by increasing protein catabolism via inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-intake-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Low dietary protein intake may be associated with increased risk of death among hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-intake-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

Therefore, it is important to monitor protein intake, along with other measures of nutrition among these patients.</p><p>It is difficult to directly measure protein intake. A method that is commonly used to estimate protein intake is to measure the rate of increase in serum urea nitrogen levels between two hemodialysis treatments. This indirect marker of protein intake is referred to as the protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance (PNA) or protein catabolic rate (PCR). The PCR is used to assess dietary protein intake in dialysis patients.</p><p>This topic reviews the use of the PCR for the estimation of protein intake and recommendations for optimal protein intake for dialysis patients.</p><p>The assessment of overall nutritional status and treatment of malnutrition among hemodialysis patients is discussed elsewhere.

The interdialytic appearance of urea is determined by measuring the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at the end of one dialysis session and just prior to the start of the next dialysis session. Among patients who have low BUN, measuring the change in BUN between dialysis sessions (ie, the PCR) distinguishes adequate dialysis as a cause of low BUN from poor intake resulting from inadequate dialysis.</p><p>As an example, a low predialysis BUN could represent either a well-nourished patient who is adequately dialyzed or a patient who is malnourished due to poor appetite from inadequate dialysis. The PCR will distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>The PCR is expressed as g per day. Usually, the PCR is normalized to the patient&rsquo;s body weight (nPCR), which is expressed as <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day.</p><p>The PCR in patients treated with hemodialysis is calculated by various urea kinetic modeling software programs.

A rapid increase in PCR or a PCR over 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> is likely to be attributed to an increase in catabolic rate during infection or inflammation, especially if the PCR increase occurs in the setting of loss of weight and decline in serum albumin and creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protein-intake-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Conversely, the PCR underestimates dietary protein intake in patients who are anabolic, such as those recovering from infection, growing children, or individuals in the last trimester of pregnancy.
