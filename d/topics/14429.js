Unfortunately, many patients are not treated appropriately, with some overtreated (when they would have been cured solely with local therapy) and others undertreated (eg, not treated in the adjuvant setting or treated with drugs that are ultimately not active). It would be of great value to have reliable prognostic factors that could help select those patients most at risk for recurrence. In addition, clinically applicable predictive factors would aid in the personalization of adjuvant therapy by identifying which therapies would be most likely of benefit to patients and which patients would not benefit, potentially sparing them from the unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic and expensive therapies.</p><p>By definition, a <strong>prognostic</strong> factor is capable of providing information on clinical outcome at the time of diagnosis, independent of therapy. Such markers are usually indicators of growth, invasion, and metastatic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. By contrast, a <strong>predictive</strong> factor is capable of providing information on the likelihood of response to a given therapeutic modality. Such markers are either within the target of the treatment or serve as modulators or epiphenomena related to expression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of the target. Although they can be separately classified, several factors in breast cancer are both prognostic and predictive (eg, the presence of overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]).</p><p>This topic will review prognostic and predictive factors that are relevant for patients diagnosed with early, nonmetastatic breast cancer.

Furthermore, the 10 percent of women who continued to smoke after diagnosis were more likely than never-smokers to die of breast cancer (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.13-2.60).

Given the number of &quot;prospective-retrospective&quot; studies that have validated &lt;18 as a cutoff to distinguish low from intermediate RS, it is reasonable not to administer adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer and an RS of &lt;18. We await reporting of outcomes in women with intermediate and high RS from the TAILORx trial to further inform the optimal cutoff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p>The RS has been prospectively validated as a prognostic tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/102,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,106</a>]. For example, the TAILORx study evaluated outcomes in over 1600 women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer and a low RS (&le;10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. At five years, high rates of invasive disease-free survival (DFS) (94 percent), freedom from distant metastatic disease (99 percent), and overall survival (98 percent) were observed in this low-RS subset. Reporting on patients with intermediate and high RS scores is pending. Similarly, in the PlanB study, which included approximately 2300 patients with hormone receptor-positive, pN0-1 disease, the three-year progression-free survival among the patients with RS &le;11 who did not receive chemotherapy was 98 percent versus 98 percent among those with RS of 12 to 25 receiving chemotherapy and 95 percent among those with RS &gt;25 receiving chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].<strong> </strong>The extremely low risk of recurrence in node-negative tumors with low RS implies that no additional benefit would be achieved with chemotherapy in this cohort of patients.</p><p>These results support earlier retrospective evaluations of clinical trial specimens (&quot;prospective-retrospective&quot; studies), which suggested that a low RS may identify women whose recurrence risk is so low that chemotherapy is unlikely to produce a meaningful benefit.

However, there was no evidence of a benefit with the addition of CMF among those with a low (&lt;18) or an intermediate RS (19 to 30). It should be noted that the cutoff for low, intermediate, and high RS differed between the TAILORx and NSABP B-20 studies. </p><p>It has been argued that RS can be supplanted by improvements in pathologic grading and quantitative hormone receptor scoring. However, the NSABP B-20 study suggests that this may not be true. Even with central laboratory grading, 19 percent of high-grade tumors had a low RS and 5 percent of low-grade tumors had a high RS.

In several of these reports, the presence of bone marrow micrometastases was linked to other poor prognostic features such as tumor size, grade, and nodal status, and they were not an independent contributor of outcome in multivariate analysis.

By contrast, a <strong>predictive</strong> factor is capable of providing information on the likelihood of response to a given therapeutic modality. Although they can be separately classified, several factors in breast cancer are both prognostic and predictive (eg, the presence of overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]). (See <a href=\"#H682639939\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential markers must demonstrate three factors to be of clinical use: analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility. In addition, it should be able to provide significant and independent value; be determined feasibly, reproducible, and widely available; be readily interpretable; and must not consume tissue needed for other tests. (See <a href=\"#H27535206\" class=\"local\">'Criteria to determine if a factor is prognostic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both younger and older age at diagnosis is associated with a worse prognosis. In addition, black women have a worse prognosis compared with white women, even after controlling for disease characteristics at presentation. (See <a href=\"#H682639966\" class=\"local\">'Patient features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among pathologic factors, tumor stage (tumor size, nodal status, and whether or not metastatic disease is present) is the most important prognostic indicator. (See <a href=\"#H682639978\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All women with newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic breast cancer should undergo tumor testing for hormone receptor expression and HER2 overexpression. In addition to being prognostic, this information can be used to tailor individualized plans for adjuvant therapy. (See <a href=\"#H682640025\" class=\"local\">'Tissue markers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H682640162\" class=\"local\">'ER predicting response to endocrine therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H682640168\" class=\"local\">'Predicting response to HER2-directed therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The emergence of genomics techniques and the ability to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes has led to the identification of biology-based prognostic profiles, several of which have been validated and are in clinical use. While Recurrence Score (RS) is the most well-validated, we agree with The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) that EndoPredict, Predictor Analysis of Microarray 50 (PAM50), and the Breast Cancer Index may also be used. (See <a href=\"#H103670818\" class=\"local\">'Gene expression profiles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers, the recurrence score (RS) is prognostic, particularly for women with pathologically node-negative disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-her2-negative-breast-cancer#H449988865\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Among hormone receptor-positive breast cancers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gene expression studies have identified several distinct breast cancer subtypes that differ markedly in prognosis. The major clusters are those relating to ER expression (the luminal cluster), HER2 expression, proliferation, and a unique cluster of genes called the basal cluster. Others are being identified as investigators continue to study the genomic data derived from breast cancer specimens. (See <a href=\"#H697669959\" class=\"local\">'Genomic profiles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proliferative rate of breast cancer appears to be a prognostic indicator. (See <a href=\"#H103669152\" class=\"local\">'Markers of proliferation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is prognostic for women with early, nonmetastatic breast cancer. However, it is not clear how this information can be used to guide clinical care, and we do not routinely measure CTCs in this population.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), Peto R, Davies C, et al.
