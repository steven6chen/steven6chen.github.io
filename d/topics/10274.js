Among the malignancies are solid tumors, acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). While the former occur late in the post-transplant course (&gt;3 years post transplant), PTLD usually occurs in the first year after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These cancers are expected to have a significant impact upon survival in this patient population. The relative risk of developing a malignancy following HCT has varied greatly among studies and is dependent upon a number of patient and treatment factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation dose and fields</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy agents and doses administered</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Length and severity of immunodeficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic graft-versus-host disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epstein-Barr virus infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient age at treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking history</p><p/><p>There is an increased risk of second cancers when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> maintenance is used for multiple myeloma.

Large retrospective series have estimated the cumulative incidence rates of secondary solid tumors at 1 to 2 percent at 10 years and 3 to 5 percent at 20 years after allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6-9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9,11</a>]. Smaller retrospective studies of autologous HCT have estimated the cumulative incidence rates of secondary solid tumors at 4 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. Solid tumors of practically every type have been described in the allogeneic and autologous HCT setting.</p><p>The largest experience comes from a review of 28,874 allogeneic transplant recipients by the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Patients transplanted for Fanconi anemia or primary immunodeficiency diseases were excluded because of their genetic susceptibility to cancer. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCT survivors developed new solid cancers at twice the expected rate in the general population (observed-to-expected ratio 2.1; 95% CI 1.8-2.5).

The comparable risk for older patients was 1.1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients under the age of 30, a significant excess risk of cancer was noted in patients transplanted for acute myeloid leukemia (excess risk 26.6 per 10,000 patients per year), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (17.5 per 10,000 patients per year), and chronic myeloid leukemia (9.7 per 10,000 patients per year). Among patients over the age of 30, a significant excess risk was noted only in those transplanted for acute myeloid leukemia (21 per 10,000 patients per year). (See <a href=\"#H25091611\" class=\"local\">'Risk according to reason for HCT'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no significant increase in risk among patients transplanted for nonmalignant hematologic diseases other than aplastic anemia. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'HCT for nonmalignant hematologic disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Similar results were noted in a report of 1036 consecutive patients who were transplanted because of malignancy, severe aplastic anemia, and inborn errors of the hematopoietic and immune systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The transplants were performed after 1985 and all analyzed patients survived for at least five years. At a median follow-up of 10.7 years, the actuarial incidence of second malignancy was 3.5 percent at 10 years and 12.8 percent at 15 years; the risk was 3.8 times higher than that in an age-matched control population. The most frequent sites of the 53 tumors were the skin (14 patients), oral cavity (seven), uterus or cervix (five), thyroid (five), breast (four), and glial tissue (three). The two major risk factors were older age and the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> to prevent chronic graft-versus-host disease.</p><p>The largest autologous experiences comes from a multicenter retrospective analysis that evaluated the incidence of secondary solid tumors in 1347 patients with lymphoma treated with high dose sequential chemotherapy followed by autologous HCT rescue between 1985 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At a median follow-up of seven years, the estimated five-, 10- and 15-year cumulative incidences of solid tumors were 2.54, 6.79, and 9.14 percent, respectively. Of the 65 secondary solid tumors identified, the most common were in the lung, gastrointestinal tract, skin, breast, head and neck, bladder, and thyroid. The risk of developing a secondary solid tumor was increased in patients age &gt;45, in those receiving radiation after high dose sequential chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.64-1.25), and in patients whose treatment included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74). Despite the association with an increased risk of developing secondary solid tumors, the addition of rituximab to the treatment program resulted in improved overall survival rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1273797\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonmelanoma skin cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HCT survivors are at increased risk of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer.

The risk of SCC is particularly high among patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), prior chronic lichenoid lesions of the oral mucosa, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of Fanconi&rsquo;s anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5,7,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,15,16</a>]. SCC of the oral cavity can involve the buccal mucosa, salivary glands, gingiva, lip, or tongue. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients with nonhealing oral lesions, leukoplakia, localized oral pain, or changes in the mucosal color or texture. SCC in this setting is often clinically aggressive and screening is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H1273635\" class=\"local\">'Screening and preventative measures'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>In one study of oral SCCs arising in long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT, the source of the malignant cells was surprisingly found to be the HCT donor in four of the eight cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Of interest, none of these four hosts had personal risk factors for oral SCC (eg, smoking, alcohol abuse); all had a previous history of extensive chronic GVHD with oral mucosa involvement, requiring prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p>The relationship between SCC and GVHD was further explored in a study encompassing an international cohort of over 24,000 patients who underwent allogeneic or syngeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The predominant underlying primary diseases for patients in whom SCC developed were leukemia and severe aplastic anemia, with a median time from HCT to the diagnosis of a solid tumor of 7.0 years (range: 0.9 to 23 years), and a cumulative incidence of 1.1 percent at 20 years. Risk factors significantly associated with development of SCC included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe chronic GVHD &ndash; Relative risk (RR) 9.9</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe chronic GVHD treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> &ndash; RR 16.2</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe chronic GVHD treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> for &ge;24 months &ndash; RR 28.8</p><p/><p>Since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> is now rarely, if ever, used for the treatment of chronic GVHD, this complication may be less of a problem for current and future patients.

The cumulative incidence is 1 percent at 10 years, with 82 percent occurring in the first year. The risk of developing PTLD is highest at one to five months post-transplant followed by a steep decline in incidence after one year (120 versus 5 cases per 10,000 patients per year among survivors for more than one year). The risk of developing PTLD varies and is dependent upon features of the donor, recipient, and preparative regimen in particular with the use of T cell depletion.

It is difficult to evaluate the role of HCT in the development of secondary malignancies in SAA because malignancy also occurs after use of immunosuppressive therapy alone in SAA, which often consists of antithymocyte globulin, corticosteroids, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>.

Hematologic malignancies occurring within six months or solid tumors developing within 12 months were excluded since they might have been due to the underlying disease rather than therapy. The 10-year cumulative risk of second malignancies was 3.1 percent with HCT and 18.8 percent with immunosuppressive therapy. The distribution of tumors was different: primarily solid tumors after HCT and primarily hematologic malignancies (acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) after immunosuppressive therapy. The risk of solid tumors was the same in the two groups. The major risk factors for malignancy after HCT were increasing age and the use of radiation therapy in the conditioning regimen.</p><p>In a second series, 700 patients with either SAA or Fanconi anemia underwent allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The actuarial risk of developing a secondary malignancy at 20 years was 14 percent overall but was 42 percent in the 79 patients with Fanconi anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Among the tumors, there were 18 solid tumors (all but one squamous cell carcinoma) presenting at a median of 99 months after transplant and five hematologic malignancies (acute lymphoblastic leukemia and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease) presenting at a median of three months post-transplant. Among the patients with SAA, the major risk factors for malignancy were the use of irradiation as part of the conditioning regimen and of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> for chronic graft-versus-host disease. Since neither of these modalities is commonly used at present, it is likely that the current risk of secondary malignancy is lower.

Every effort should be made to identify these patients prior to autologous HCT with screening bone marrow aspiration, biopsy, and cytogenetic studies. If a cytogenetic abnormality is found, altering the treatment approach to an allogeneic HCT is indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study evaluated 188 patients with multiple myeloma who underwent autologous transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The patients were divided into two groups: one exposed to prolonged therapy with alkylating agents prior to transplantation and one exposed to only one cycle of chemotherapy prior to transplantation. All seven patients who developed MDS, which occurred at a median of 24 months, were in the group with high pre-transplant exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Due to these and other findings, it is recommended to avoid alkylating agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> for the treatment of transplant-eligible multiple myeloma patients prior to collection of hematopoietic stem cells.

It is unclear, however, if the risk is increased. Data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry suggested that patients undergoing HCT for nonmalignant diseases had an incidence of secondary malignancies that was not significantly increased when compared with the expected value in the normal population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Similarly, although malignancy occurs after HCT for beta thalassemia, the rate does not appear to be higher than that seen in patients with this disorder who are not transplanted. In the Registry report described above, patients with congenital immune deficiencies were excluded because they may have an underlying increase in the risk for cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1273635\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING AND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While HCT survivors are at increased risk of developing secondary malignancies, the ideal screening program has not been defined. No prospective analyses have evaluated the benefit of screening in this population. However, extrapolation of data from other settings suggests that the ability to prevent and detect solid organ malignancies in the HCT survivor relies upon periodic screening examinations and strict adherence to prophylactic measures. Our approach is similar to that proposed in the joint screening recommendations provided by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, and the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk awareness counseling annually &mdash; HCT survivors should be advised of their increased risk of developing a malignancy following HCT and encouraged to report any concerning symptoms to their physician.
