Pelvic injuries often occur in conjunction with other life-threatening injuries, and there is not universal agreement on all aspects of management. Following initial resuscitation, current management algorithms in the United States incorporate variable timeframes for bony stabilization and hemorrhage control using resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA), preperitoneal pelvic packing, or angioembolization. We suggest early fixation and pelvic packing for hemodynamically unstable patients, reserving angioembolization for noncoagulopathic patients who continue to bleed from a pelvic source in spite of pelvic packing. The management of severe pelvic fractures is optimized using a multidisciplinary approach involving the trauma surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, vascular interventionalist, anesthesiologist, and the transfusion services. </p><p>Methods to treat severe pelvic fractures, including controlling ongoing hemorrhage, are reviewed here. The diagnosis and initial trauma management of patients with pelvic fractures are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1329894718\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt injury to the pelvis can produce complex fractures that often result in moderate-to-severe hemorrhage. The Young and Burgess classification uses the force vector to categorize pelvic fractures as due to lateral compression (LC), <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/posterior</span> compression (APC), or vertical shear (VS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81214\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81214 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55023 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Within each category, the amount of ligamentous injury, bony fracture, and overall displacement of the hemipelvis further categorizes the patient's pelvic injury from type I (less severe) to type III (most severe). However, a patient's fracture pattern may not adhere to a single category; a combination of LC, APC, and VS may be present. Higher grades, particularly APC and VS, are more commonly associated with hemodynamic instability and the need for transfusion and intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Fracture types'</a>.)</p><p>Pelvic fractures can also be described as biomechanically stable or unstable within the Academy of <span class=\"nowrap\">Orthopedics/Orthopedic</span> Trauma Association classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Unstable pelvic fractures require two or more breaks in the pelvic ring. It is important to note that biomechanical instability of the pelvic fracture does not necessarily imply hemodynamic stability. The fracture components and ligamentous instability may result in a rotationally unstable (partially stable pelvis, type B) or a rotationally and vertically unstable (completely unstable, type C) pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76038\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76038 \">figure 2</a>). Generally, APC I and II and LC I, II, and III injuries are considered rotationally unstable while APC III, VS, and combined injuries are both rotationally and vertically unstable.</p><p>Fractures that create soft tissue defects are termed &quot;open&quot; fractures; however, the break can occur in the rectum, vagina, or skin, and these associated injuries complicate management. (See <a href=\"#H255194905\" class=\"local\">'Management of associated soft tissue injury'</a> below.)</p><p>Movement of the bony surfaces of the pelvic bones can lead to shearing and avulsion of the pelvic vasculature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60420\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60420 \">figure 3</a>). The veins of the presacral pelvic plexus are particularly vulnerable. Greater than 85 percent of bleeding due to pelvic fractures is venous or from the open surfaces of the bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H293633879\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform initial resuscitation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of the trauma patient with blunt or penetrating trauma based upon protocols from the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, established by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The patient's blood pressure and pulse should be monitored closely. A systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg in adults is assumed to be due to hemorrhage until proven otherwise, and a diagnosis of pelvic fracture as a cause of hemodynamic instability should trigger resuscitation using a massive transfusion protocol. Traumatic coagulopathy will exacerbate bleeding, and a diagnosis should be actively sought. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coagulopathy associated with trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pelvic fracture as the primary source of hemodynamic instability should be quickly differentiated from other life-threatening injuries such as hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, or hemoperitoneum, using chest radiograph, pelvic radiograph, and Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma (FAST).

Overlying abrasions or contusions are commonly seen. Patients who cannot relate pain, such as patients who are intubated or those with altered mental status, should undergo plain radiography in the trauma bay. Only hemodynamically stable patients should be transported for computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis. The initial approach to the diagnosis and resuscitation in patients with pelvic fractures in the emergency department is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Transport of the hypotensive patient is potentially unsafe because ongoing monitoring and management of acute hemodynamic decompensation may be compromised. Hemodynamically stable patients undergoing further imaging should be accompanied by a senior member of the trauma team who should be prepared to abort the study and transport the patient directly to the operating room if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. </p><p>CT scanning, particularly with three-dimensional reconstruction, is useful for planning definitive fracture repair by defining the geometry of the pelvic fracture, identifying occult fractures not seen on plain film, quantifying pelvic displacement, and evaluating the integrity of the ligaments. Pelvic bleeding may also be seen as contrast extravasation, but this finding should not be used in isolation as an indication for arteriography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].

If the patient is markedly hemodynamically unstable (persistent systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt;80 mmHg) in the emergency department, aortic occlusion using an endovascular balloon should be considered, (ie, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta [REBOA]) if appropriate equipment and expertise is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

If ongoing hemodynamic instability is thought to be due to retroperitoneal bleeding from the pelvic fracture, then, in addition to external fixation, we suggest preperitoneal pelvic packing. Pelvic-fracture-related bleeding is often evident on laparotomy as a large pelvic space hematoma. Alternatively, in an appropriately equipped operating room, intraoperative angiography and embolization may be an option. (See <a href=\"#H113250380\" class=\"local\">'Fracture stabilization'</a> below.)</p><p>Although there are no direct comparisons, based upon observational studies evaluating each therapy, combined with our clinical experience, we suggest operative control with preperitoneal pelvic packing rather than angioembolization to tamponade bleeding in hemodynamically unstable patients, reserving angioembolization for the few patients who demonstrate persistent bleeding in spite of these maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/24,36-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,36-43</a>].

The original technique described for control of retroperitoneal bleeding consisted of transabdominal (transperitoneal) packing of the retroperitoneum for hemorrhage control; however, sufficient tamponade was difficult to achieve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/40,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,65</a>], and thus, this technique was modified to directly pack the pelvic space through a preperitoneal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/63,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,67</a>]. </p><p>Preperitoneal pelvic packing can lead to infectious complications, which may affect the timing and choice of definitive stabilization. In a review that evaluated 75 patients who underwent preperitoneal pelvic packing for pelvic fracture, pelvic space infection occurred in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The majority occurred in patients with open fracture-associated <span class=\"nowrap\">bowel/bladder</span> injuries or those with repacking of the pelvic space.&nbsp;A significantly lower rate of pelvic space infection was found in those patients who were packed only once (6 versus 47 percent) compared with those who underwent more than one packing procedure. Although pelvic packing is typically removed within 24 to 48 hours, removal of pelvic packs should be delayed until the patient's coagulopathy is corrected and bleeding has stopped to avoid repeated packing of the pelvis. </p><p>Approximately 15 percent of patients with severe pelvic fractures will have ongoing transfusion requirements despite correction of coagulopathy after preperitoneal packing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Persistent bleeding may indicate the need for arteriography to identify the source. Transfusion greater than 4 units after normalization of the patient's coagulation status is considered an indication for angiography if transfusion is needed acutely following packing (ie, within 12 hours) and is not attributed to another source (ie, draining hemothorax).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1329894754\"><span class=\"h2\">Arteriography and angioembolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angioembolization is a technique in which bleeding sites are controlled by using intra-arterial catheters to selectively place thrombotic agents into branches of the internal iliac arteries that are feeding the area of bleeding. Advocates of emergent angioembolization (hemodynamically unstable patients) have argued that the technique can be safe in selected patients and effective in controlling pelvic arterial hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/39,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,68,69</a>]. However, in one study, patients admitted at night or on weekends had a significant increase in time to angioembolization compared with those arriving during the daytime and during the week, and after-hours admission was associated with significantly increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/54,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,70</a>]. The technique is less successful if bleeding is of venous origin or from the raw surfaces of the disrupted bone. </p><p>The reported indications for arteriography have included low blood pressure in spite of red blood cell transfusion, large retroperitoneal hematoma, and active contrast extravasation indicative of arterial bleeding on computed tomography of the pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/39,48-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,48-53</a>]. Numerous authors have sought to predict mortality and the need for arteriography based upon fracture classification and physiologic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/39,48,69,71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,48,69,71-73</a>]. In general, type II and III pelvic fractures are at a greater risk for arterial hemorrhage. However, predicting who would or would not benefit from angioembolization remains difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>At the time of diagnostic arteriography, the entire pelvic vasculature must be evaluated because multiple sites of hemorrhage are common in complex pelvic fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Selective embolization at a targeted site of bleeding is performed using absorbable gelatin. Historically, if the patient's bleeding was severe and not localized, nonselective embolization of the internal iliac arteries was performed. Current management cautions against empiric bilateral internal iliac artery embolization because of an increased risk for complications such as gluteal claudication, pelvic ischemia, and tissue necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255194905\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of associated soft tissue injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the challenges faced with complex pelvic fractures, patients with open pelvic fractures often require management of extensive soft tissue destruction. </p><p>On examination, external lacerations should be inspected to determine if there is a communication with the pelvic fracture (ie, an open pelvic fracture).

Early optimization determines when the patient can return to the operating room to remove pelvic packing or definitively manage other injuries that were previously handled using damage control techniques. Specific goals of resuscitation include a base deficit &lt;6, normal coagulation indices, and a core temperature &gt;37&ordm;C. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fluid management algorithms are aimed at restoring tissue perfusion and reducing the base deficit. The resuscitation of injured patients with pelvic fractures may require infusion volumes of 10 L during the initial resuscitative phase to attain an adequate preload. Although early colloid administration is appealing, evidence to date does not support this concept in patients who do not demonstrate acute traumatic coagulopathy. Managing crystalloid volume remains a challenging aspect of early care, balancing optimal cardiac performance against excessive tissue edema, which can contribute to pulmonary edema, abdominal compartment syndrome, and poor wound healing. A goal-directed resuscitation approach consisting of initial volume loading to attain adequate preload, followed by the judicious use of inotropic agents or vasopressors, can be used to limit the amount of crystalloid administered to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. </p><p>Although the optimal hemoglobin (Hg) level remains debated, we prefer to maintain the Hg &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> to optimize oxygen delivery during the initial resuscitation phase, or based on thromboelastography (TEG) in the initial resuscitation phase.

Directly associated injuries include bladder injury, urethral injury, spinal injury, vascular injury, rectal injury, and vaginal injury. Mortality in patients with severe pelvic fractures ranges from 8 to 40 percent and is correlated more to the injury severity score, and degree of shock at presentation, which reflects these associated injuries, rather than to the type of pelvic fracture. (See <a href=\"#H293634561\" class=\"local\">'Fracture-related injuries'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1329894782\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic fractures can be described as mechanically stable or unstable. Two or more breaks in the pelvic ring are needed to create an unstable pelvic fracture. Pelvic fractures are classified as rotationally unstable, vertically unstable, or both. The hemodynamic status of the patient is not necessarily related to the type of mechanical stability of the pelvis. Fractures that create soft tissue defects are termed &quot;open&quot; fractures, and associated injuries complicate management. (See <a href=\"#H1329894718\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamically unstable patients with pelvic fracture and indications for surgery (eg, positive Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma [FAST] scan indicating massive hemoperitoneum) should be taken directly to the operating room to identify and manage the source of hemorrhage, which may be intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, or due to the pelvic fracture. (See <a href=\"#H42517110\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom hemodynamic instability is thought to be due to retroperitoneal bleeding from the pelvic fracture, we suggest operative control of hemorrhage using external fracture fixation plus preperitoneal pelvic packing to tamponade bleeding, rather than external pelvic fracture fixation plus arteriography and angioembolization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The majority of severe bleeding due to pelvic fractures is venous in origin, and only a small percentage of patients (15 percent) will have a bleeding site that is amenable to embolization. Fracture fixation decreases pelvic volume, promotes tamponade of venous bleeding, and prevents shifting of the bony elements limiting secondary hemorrhage. Preperitoneal pelvic packing involves the placement of laparotomy sponges into the preperitoneal space via a suprapubic incision, which reduces the available volume of the retroperitoneal space and tamponades pelvic bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H113250380\" class=\"local\">'Fracture stabilization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H255193898\" class=\"local\">'Preperitoneal pelvic packing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioembolization may be an option to control pelvic arterial hemorrhage from pelvic fracture under certain circumstances. These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who have evidence for postoperative bleeding following external fracture fixation and preperitoneal pelvic packing (typically &gt;4 unit red blood cells [RBCs] in the noncoagulopathic patient) in 12 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who are hemodynamically stable but demonstrate evidence for ongoing bleeding that cannot be attributed to another source.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If arteriography identifies arterial bleeding, selective arterial embolization should be performed to minimize the potential for tissue ischemia or necrosis, rather than performing nonselective embolization, whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H1329894754\" class=\"local\">'Arteriography and angioembolization'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following an interval of ongoing resuscitation and management of other urgent injuries, the decision for and timing of internal fixation is highly individualized, depending upon the nature of the pelvic fracture, the presence and severity of associated injuries, and the patient's medical comorbidities. For some patients, definitive treatment of the pelvic fracture may be accomplished by external fixation alone. (See <a href=\"#H113250380\" class=\"local\">'Fracture stabilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe pelvic fractures have multiple risk factors for deep vein thrombosis and should receive thromboprophylaxis.
