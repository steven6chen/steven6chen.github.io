Most of these cases are self-limited, with fewer than 28 percent presenting for medical care. Fewer than 100 per 10,000 children are hospitalized in the United States for diarrheal disease, and this figure includes many cases of acute diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic pathophysiology of all diarrheas is incomplete absorption of water from the intestinal lumen either because of a reduced rate of net water absorption (related to impaired electrolyte absorption or excessive electrolyte secretion) or because of osmotic retention of water within the lumen. Reduction of net water absorption by as little as 1 percent may be sufficient to cause diarrhea. Consequently, even relatively modest compromise of absorptive function can lead to loose stools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Consequently, a wide variety of etiologies should be considered, including functional and infectious causes but also heritable disorders of immune regulation, macronutrient digestion, mucosal barrier function, and transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL DIARRHEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional diarrhea is defined as the painless passage of four or more large, unformed stools for four or more weeks, with onset in infancy or the preschool years, and without failure to thrive or a specific definable cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This common, benign disorder has also been termed chronic nonspecific diarrhea of childhood or toddler's diarrhea.</p><p>Children with functional diarrhea usually pass stools only during waking hours, but up to 25 percent have nighttime stools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Early morning stools typically are large and semi-formed, then stools become progressively looser as the day progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Virtually all children develop normal bowel patterns by four or five years of age. In some cases, the diarrhea is associated with excessive intake of fruit juice, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sorbitol</a>, fructose or other osmotically active carbohydrates, and will improve when the intake of these foods is reduced. Other than this precaution, restrictions to the diet or other interventions are not necessary or helpful. In particular, restriction of dietary fat may be counter-productive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>If the evaluation suggests functional diarrhea, we suggest trials of the following dietary changes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce or eliminate fruit juice or other osmotically active carbohydrates. Apple, prune, and pear juice contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sorbitol</a> and have a particularly high osmotic load.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liberalize the fat content of the diet to 35 to 50 percent of total calories.</p><p/><p>Other than these two measures, dietary restrictions are not helpful and are sometimes counter-productive and prolong the illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTIOUS CAUSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Postenteritis syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most enteric infections in otherwise healthy children resolve within 14 days and do not develop into a chronic diarrhea illness. However, in a minority of patients, an acute gastroenteritis can trigger persistent diarrhea by causing mucosal damage to the small intestine, termed a &quot;postenteritis syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/8,11,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,16,17</a>]. The mechanisms underlying this syndrome are not fully understood. Contrary to previous hypotheses, sensitization to food antigens and secondary disaccharidase deficiency (eg, lactase deficiency causing lactose intolerance), are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>].

Chronic infections with these pathogens are uncommon in immunocompetent hosts. Bacterial cultures should be part of the initial diagnostic evaluation for all patients if the stool contains blood, or for immunocompromised patients regardless of the presence or absence of fecal blood.

The enzyme immunoassay available in most laboratories detects C. difficile toxins A and B with high specificity but only moderate sensitivity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based diagnostic methods can enhance the detection rate but may result in over-diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].

However, in two case reports, enteric infections with these strains were associated with chronic diarrhea and an enteropathy in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Specific antigen assays for Giardia and examination from the stool for parasites are imperative for children with known immunodeficiencies or with a history of travel to endemic areas. These tests are also an appropriate step in the evaluation of immunocompetent children if initial testing fails to determine a cause of the chronic diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giardiasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When a specific parasite is identified, treatment with specific medications is generally indicated, although the organism may not always be the cause of the diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Empiric therapy for enteric pathogens is generally not advised, except in cases with special characteristics in resource-limited countries.

In this case, the evaluation should focus on potential infectious causes of the diarrhea, particularly parasites and opportunistic infections such as Cryptosporidium, Isospora, and Cyclospora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/8,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,36</a>]. These children are also at risk for persistent infectious pathogens that typically cause acute diarrheas, such as rotavirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

When a patient is infected with an unusual pathogen, or has multiple or recurrent infections of the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere, further evaluation for immune deficiency is required. In rare instances, live vaccines may call attention to the potential diagnosis of immunodeficiency by inducing chronic infection. As an example, vaccine-acquired chronic rotavirus diarrhea has been observed in infants with severe combined immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

These disorders typically present with gradual onset of chronic diarrhea, with or without blood, from mid-childhood through adulthood. Ulcerative colitis can occasionally present with acute colonic inflammation that resembles bacterial colitis (eg, Salmonella). Infantile and very early onset IBD (onset at age less than six years) appears to be a distinct subset of these diseases, in which clinical and genetic characteristics are distinct compared with later-onset cases of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].
