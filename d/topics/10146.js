Like other carcinoid tumors, lung NETs are thought to derive from peptide- and amine-producing neuroendocrine cells. NETs can arise at a number of sites throughout the body, including the thymus, lung, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and ovary. The GI tract is the most frequently involved site for NETs, while the lung is the second most common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-characteristics-of-well-differentiated-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-arising-in-the-tubular-digestive-tract-lung-and-genitourinary-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical characteristics of well-differentiated neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors arising in the tubular digestive tract, lung, and genitourinary tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lung NETs are characterized by strikingly heterogeneous pathological features and clinical behavior. At one end of the spectrum are the so-called typical carcinoids, which are well-differentiated, low-grade, slowly growing neoplasms that seldom metastasize to extrathoracic structures. At the other end of the spectrum are the poorly differentiated and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas, as typified by small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which behaves aggressively, with rapid tumor growth and early distant dissemination. The biologic behavior of atypical carcinoid tumors, which are of intermediate grade and differentiation, is intermediate between typical carcinoid tumors and SCLC. The terms &quot;typical&quot; and &quot;atypical&quot; carcinoid of the lung correspond roughly to the terms &quot;grade 1&quot; and &quot;grade 2,&quot; which are used more commonly in extrathoracic NETs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-classification-histology-diagnosis-and-staging#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors: Epidemiology, risk factors, classification, histology, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Classification, histology, and histochemistry'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H799311\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on 'Classification and terminology'</a>.)</p><p>Multifocal disease is relatively common in patients with low-grade lung NETs. An extreme example is diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH), a benign condition characterized by diffuse hyperplasia of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and formation of multiple carcinoid tumorlets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies#H4074448180\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;, section on 'DIPNECH'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of both typical and atypical lung NETs (carcinoid tumors) will be discussed here.

For patients whose condition does not permit complete resection and for exceptional low-grade cases where the lesion is entirely endobronchial, transbronchoscopic resection may be an alternative. (See <a href=\"#H1143201199\" class=\"local\">'Endobronchial management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1143201171\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with either a typical or atypical lung NET whose medical condition and pulmonary reserve will tolerate it, we recommend surgical resection, and mediastinal lymph node sampling or dissection.</p><p>Surgery is the treatment of choice for lung NETs and the therapeutic option offering the best chance of cure. The goal is en bloc resection of the entire neoplasm with preservation of as much functional lung as possible. For low-grade (typical) tumors, attempts to preserve lung parenchyma by the use of lung-sparing techniques (eg, sleeve resection) to avoid lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy are justified and safe for typical lung NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. However, formal oncologic surgery (eg, lobectomy or even pneumonectomy, when necessary) is appropriate for atypical or poorly differentiated tumors.</p><p>Since typical lung NETs, unlike bronchogenic carcinomas, tend not to spread submucosally, an endobronchial surgical margin as narrow as 5 mm is considered adequate, but a &gt;2 cm histologically-negative lung parenchymal margin is preferred. Intraoperative frozen section analysis is critical to the success of this approach. Although long-term survival has been reported in patients with positive margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>], reresection is preferred in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7045450\"><span class=\"h3\">Proximal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For polypoid typical tumors of the mainstem bronchus or bronchus intermedius, a bronchotomy with wedge or sleeve resection of the bronchial wall and complete preservation of distal lung parenchyma could be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, such completely parenchyma-sparing procedures are only rarely possible because of the frequency of &quot;iceberg&quot; lesions (in which the tumor appears entirely intraluminal bronchoscopically but has a significant extraluminal component that is evident with high-resolution computed tomography [CT] scanning). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-classification-histology-diagnosis-and-staging#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors: Epidemiology, risk factors, classification, histology, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Cross-sectional imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Tumors with more-extensive central parenchymal involvement, those that are associated with severe distal parenchymal disease (ie, nonfunctioning lung parenchyma), and atypical lung NETs require more-extensive surgery (eg, lobectomy or pneumonectomy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7045461\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For peripheral lesions in the outer one-third of the lung, the ideal surgical approach is debated, and there is no consensus. Segmental or even wide wedge resections of small, &lt;2 cm diameter, well-differentiated lung NETs is acceptable if an adequate tumor-free margin can be obtained. Most advocate lobectomy in the case of a more central tumor involving the orifice of a segmental bronchus, while others suggest that a more limited resection (eg, segmentectomy) is acceptable for typical lung NETs because of the low likelihood of a local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7045468\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of lymph node dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 5 and 20 percent of typical lung NETs and 30 to 70 percent of atypical tumors metastasize to lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. A complete mediastinal lymph node sampling or dissection at the time of initial treatment is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], with complete resection of nodal metastasis if at all possible.

A contemporary large series with long-term follow-up and expert pathology review reported a 3 percent (9 of 291) recurrence rate for resected typical lung NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The prognostic impact of nodal involvement for typical lung NETs is controversial, but most studies show a worse outcome compared with cases without nodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9,21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21-26</a>]. Besides nodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], incomplete resection is the only widely accepted feature with negative prognostic significance. A nomogram to predict survival for typical lung NETs has been developed that is based upon age, gender, prior malignancy, tumor site (central versus peripheral), tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage, and performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F105653\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105653 \">figure 1</a>); independent validation is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7045475\"><span class=\"h4\">Atypical lung NETs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical lung NETs have a worse prognosis than do typical tumors. Five-year survival rates range widely from 30 to 95 percent; the corresponding rates at 10 years are 35 to 56 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56644 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8,13,16,18,19,23,25,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,16,18,19,23,25,28-32</a>]. Atypical tumors have a greater tendency to both metastasize (16 and 23 percent in three large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20,21,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,33</a>]) and recur locally (3 and 25 percent in the same series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20,21,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,33</a>]). Distant metastases to the liver or bone are more common than local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Most series report an adverse influence of nodal metastases on prognosis that is more profound than for typical tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56644 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15,18,29,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,29,33,34</a>]. This is best illustrated by the experience at the Mayo Clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Nineteen of 23 patients with typical lung NETs and lymph node involvement (83 percent) remained alive and well, while four failed distantly, two of whom died. In contrast, only 4 of the 11 patients with atypical tumors and lymph node involvement were alive without disease, while seven developed distant metastases and six died.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1143201185\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of adjuvant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some disagree, we suggest not administering postoperative adjuvant therapy for most R0 resected lung NETs, even in the setting of positive lymph nodes. Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy (RT) is a reasonable option for patients with histologically aggressive-appearing, stage III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 2</a>), atypical lung NETs (ie, relatively high mitotic rate, extensive necrosis, etc), although there is no evidence to support this practice. RT is a reasonable option for atypical lung NETs if gross residual disease remains after surgery, although whether this improves outcomes is unproven.</p><p>The role of adjuvant therapy after complete resection of a lung NET is undefined due to the total lack of prospective randomized trials. Patients with typical low-grade tumors (which are generally considered chemoresistant) are unlikely to benefit from adjuvant systemic treatment, even in the setting of lymph node metastases. On the other hand, atypical tumors represent a relatively broad spectrum of disease, with a higher rate of recurrence.</p><p>The benefit of adjuvant therapy has been addressed in retrospective reports, most of which have not found a benefit from adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9,14,35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14,35-39</a>].</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MD Anderson reported their experience in 73 surgical patients with lung NETs (of the 63 patients with tumor blocks available for review, there were 14 atypical and 49 typical NETs), seven of whom received adjuvant RT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy because of positive margins, local invasion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymph node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

In the largest series of 112 patients (83 typical, 29 atypical NETs) undergoing initial bronchoscopic management, who were all followed for a minimum of five years, initial bronchoscopic treatment was successfully used to avoid surgery in 47 cases (42 percent, including 42 of 83 typical but only 5 of 29 atypical NETs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Residual intraluminal disease after a second bronchoscopic resection or residual or recurrent extraluminal disease prompted surgical resection in 62 cases (including 24 of the 29 atypical lung NETs). Metastatic disease developed in four cases, and two died; all had been treated with rescue surgery. At a median follow-up of 112 months, 100 patients remained alive, and only three of the deaths were tumor related (one perioperative); disease-specific survival was 97 percent.</p><p>Close posttreatment follow-up is an integral component of bronchoscopic resection. In the series described above, patients underwent high-resolution CT and flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasonography within six weeks after endobronchial resection and were then referred for surgery for any evidence of residual disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Repeat evaluation was performed every six months for two years and annually thereafter.</p><p>In our view, the most appropriate candidates for endobronchial resection are patients who present with a polypoid intraluminal tumor, who have good bronchoscopic visualization of the distal tumor margin, and who have no evidence of bronchial wall involvement or suspicious lymphadenopathy by high-resolution CT. However, we do not consider bronchoscopic resection to represent a standard potentially curative treatment for the vast majority of patients with central lesions because, even in the setting of a negative CT, most tumors extend into or through the wall of the bronchus, and endobronchial resection risks leaving substantial tumor behind, either within or beyond the endobronchial lumen. Because of the slow-growing nature of lung NETs, it may take years before a recurrence develops.

Typical lung NETs seldom metastasize and have an excellent prognosis, even when regional lymph nodes are involved; atypical lung NETs have a higher likelihood of metastases and a worse prognosis, particularly if mediastinal nodes are involved.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with either a typical or atypical resectable lung NET whose medical condition and pulmonary reserve will tolerate it, we recommend surgical resection, and mediastinal lymph node sampling or dissection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The presence of mediastinal lymph node metastases does not preclude cure. (See <a href=\"#H1143201171\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, endobronchial resection is a suboptimal method of definitive treatment, and we suggest not pursuing this approach over definitive surgical resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Endobronchial laser resection is best reserved for palliative treatment of patients with central airway occlusion who are poor surgical candidates (eg, older adults, debilitated). (See <a href=\"#H1143201199\" class=\"local\">'Endobronchial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although some disagree, we suggest not routinely administering postoperative adjuvant therapy for resected lung NETs, even in the setting of positive lymph nodes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy (RT) is a reasonable option for patients with histologically aggressive-appearing, stage III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 2</a>), atypical lung NETs (ie, relatively high mitotic rate, extensive necrosis, etc), although there is only limited evidence to support this. RT is a reasonable option for atypical lung NETs if gross residual disease remains after surgery, although whether this improves outcomes is unproven. (See <a href=\"#H1143201185\" class=\"local\">'Role of adjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We pursue posttreatment surveillance after resection of node-positive typical lung NETs and for all atypical tumors. Computed tomography (CT) scans (including the thorax and abdomen) every six months for two years followed by annual scans for a total of 5 to 10 years represents a reasonable surveillance schedule. Patients with lymph-node negative typical lung NETs are very unlikely to benefit from postoperative surveillance due to very low risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H1143201220\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For inoperable patients and for those with surgically unresectable but nonmetastatic disease, options for local control of tumor growth include RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy and palliative endobronchial resection of obstructing tumor. For a small, peripheral, typical lung NET in a patient who is not a physiologic candidate for surgical resection, stereotactic body radiation is a reasonable therapeutic option and is likely effective, although this is an unusual situation and there are no clinical series in this tumor subset to verify benefit. (See <a href=\"#H1143201213\" class=\"local\">'Inoperable and locally advanced unresectable disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carcinoid syndrome is relatively uncommon, but it can occur both in patients with locoregional or disseminated disease. Surgical resection represents the preferred strategy for patients with locoregional lung NETs producing carcinoid syndrome. For unresectable disease, we recommend initiation of long-acting somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanreotide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4247047562\" class=\"local\">'Management of carcinoid syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment options for patients with symptoms of carcinoid syndrome that do not respond to SSA therapy include ablative treatments for liver metastases, systemic antiproliferative therapy with cytotoxic agents, peptide receptor RT (for patients with somatostatin-receptor-positive advanced disease), or the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telotristat-ethyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telotristat</a>. (See <a href=\"#H4114674457\" class=\"local\">'Refractory symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with initially slowly progressive, metastatic, somatostatin-receptor-positive (as determined by somatostatin-receptor-based diagnostic imaging)&nbsp;lung NETs, we suggest initiating therapy with an SSA for disease control (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1142853479\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy for slowly progressive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have limited, potentially resectable, liver-dominant, metastatic NETs, surgical resection is often recommended. Although the vast majority of cases will not be cured by surgery, given the slow-growing nature of the tumor, extended survival is sometimes possible. (See <a href=\"#H257870866\" class=\"local\">'Liver-dominant metastatic disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion#H691406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: Local options to control tumor growth and symptoms of hormone hypersecretion&quot;, section on 'Surgical resection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other treatment options for patients with unresectable, hepatic-dominant, metastatic disease include embolization (bland particle embolization, chemoembolization, radioembolization) and radiofrequency ablation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion#H691441\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: Local options to control tumor growth and symptoms of hormone hypersecretion&quot;, section on 'Nonsurgical liver-directed therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with progressive or disseminated disease that is SSA refractory, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Although the RADIANT 4 trial excluded concomitant SSA use, combination of everolimus with an SSA is safe and commonly prescribed in patients with gastrointestinal NETs. In some cases, everolimus may be an appropriate first-line option (eg, for patients with tumors that are somatostatin receptor negative on somatostatin receptor imaging). (See <a href=\"#H2164499725\" class=\"local\">'Everolimus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with initially rapidly progressive disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> for those whose tumors progress while receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> or who are intolerant of everolimus, cytotoxic chemotherapy is a reasonable approach. We utilize cisplatin- or carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens, such as those used for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), for patients with highly aggressive atypical lung NETs, and we use temozolomide-based chemotherapy for patients with more indolent, typical or atypical lung NETs, although the level of evidence supporting use of these drugs in this setting is low. (See <a href=\"#H2421055611\" class=\"local\">'Cytotoxic chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another option for treatment of somatostatin-receptor-positive advanced disease, is peptide receptor radioligand therapy using the radiolabeled somatostatin analog <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lutetium-lu-177-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lutetium Lu-177 dotatate</a> (<sup>177</sup>Lu-dotatate), where available.
