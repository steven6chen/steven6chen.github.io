The multipotent hematopoietic stem cells required for this procedure are usually obtained from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of a related or unrelated donor. Umbilical cord blood, the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta following the birth of an infant, has emerged as an established alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells in allogeneic HCT.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the hematopoietic stem cell model of hematopoiesis followed by a discussion of the sources of hematopoietic cells suitable for transplantation. The selection of an appropriate HCT donor, the evaluation of a potential HCT donor, and the collection of umbilical cord blood are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the hematopoietic cell transplantation donor&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Collection and storage of umbilical cord blood for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of <span class=\"nowrap\">progenitor/hematopoietic</span> stem cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Sources of hematopoietic stem cells'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STEM CELL MODEL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10148933\"><span class=\"h2\">Discovery of HSCs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematopoiesis is sustained throughout the lifespan of an individual by a small number of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells that slowly cycle from a larger quiescent pool. Circulating blood cells are immediate descendants of maturing precursors that arise from a smaller pool of progenitors. The progenitors in turn arise from an even smaller pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). HSCs are multipotent and have the capacity to differentiate into the cells of all blood lineages: erythrocytes, platelets, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The identification and role of HSCs in protecting animals from lethal irradiation emerged from studies that began in the 1950s in which it was observed that animals treated with irradiation could be protected by either lead shielding over the spleen or later infusion of splenocytes from a normal donor. With the development of in vitro and in vivo assay systems (eg, Till-McCulloch spleen-colony assay) it became clear that there were clonotypic precursor cells capable of giving rise to both erythroid and myeloid lineages of cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. HSCs were defined functionally as populations of cells capable of rescuing lethally-irradiated animals, a definition that is accurate conceptually, although difficult to apply in different systems, especially in humans. Nevertheless, it became possible to define a population of cells capable of multilineage repopulation and rescuing animals from lethal irradiation. These hematopoietic stem cells could be re-isolated and used to rescue other lethally irradiated animals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Monoclonal antibodies were subsequently developed that recognized proteins on the surface of both immature and mature populations of bone marrow-derived cells. With the refinement of cell sorting technologies, it has been possible to separate populations of cells with hematopoietic stem cell activity. Using this approach, a population of highly purified murine bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells was isolated that was capable of rescuing more than 95 percent of lethally irradiated animals when as few as 100 cells were injected intravenously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Markers on human HSCs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the exact phenotype remains controversial, in vitro and surrogate in vivo assays have been used to isolate a population of human putative hematopoietic stem cells capable of multilineage growth. Cells with these functions express the hematopoietic stem cell antigen CD34 and are Lin-; they are also described as being Thy-1lo, Dr-, or CD38- [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical trials using highly purified populations of CD34+, Thy-1+ cells have demonstrated that this cell population alone is capable of rapid and sustained hematopoietic engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Furthermore, these cells alone are capable of supporting long term hematopoiesis following autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The clinical applications of purified hematopoietic stem cells in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and gene therapy are quite broad. Using current technology of magnetic bead separation, it is possible to isolate and purify CD34+ cells with high efficiency. Further purification of subpopulations of CD34+ cells (eg, isolating Thy-1+ cells by high speed fluorescence activated cell sorting) is possible, but challenging to perform on a clinical scale.</p><p>A population of CD34 negative hematopoietic stem cells has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], which is capable of reconstituting lethally irradiated animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Despite this observation, there is a large volume of clinical data that support the concept that CD34 expression and the number of CD34+ cells infused correlate closely with the pace of hematopoietic reconstitution both in animals and in humans (see <a href=\"#H10150103\" class=\"local\">'PBPC mobilization'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematopoietic stem cells can be found in several different human tissues: bone marrow; peripheral blood, especially following mobilization; and umbilical vein cord blood obtained at the time of delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10149036\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone marrow harvest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique of bone marrow harvesting has become routine. Bone marrow is generally aspirated from the posterior iliac crests under either regional or general anesthesia. Additional bone marrow can be obtained from the anterior iliac crest; however, the amounts available are relatively limited and this site is generally used only for diagnostic purposes. In patients who have received prior irradiation to the pelvis, it may not be possible to isolate sufficient bone marrow from these sites, and alternative approaches to collect or alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells are required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy-indications-and-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: Indications and technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple aspirations are performed with the collection of approximately 5 to 10 mL of marrow from each puncture site, with a goal of collecting up to 10 to 15 mL of marrow per kilogram of recipient body weight (between 700 and 1500 mL of bone marrow for an adult recipient). Guidelines established by the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) limit the volume of bone marrow removed to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of donor weight. Either heparin or acid-citrate-dextran-A can be used to anticoagulate bone marrow products. If the product is to be cryopreserved, red cells are washed off prior to freezing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor#H10299559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the hematopoietic cell transplantation donor&quot;, section on 'Bone marrow collection'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10149189\"><span class=\"h3\">Mobilized bone marrow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative to collection of unstimulated bone marrow is to prime with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prior to bone marrow harvest (10 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> SQ per day for three days). This has resulted in effective hematopoietic recovery in a study of heavily pretreated patients with poor peripheral blood stem cell mobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. There have been some suggestions that this approach may result in decreased incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease. A relatively small randomized study has suggested that the use of G-CSF primed bone marrow may result in such benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, this will require validation in larger numbers of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10149042\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cell dose required for stable long term engraftment has not been determined with precision; however, useful goals have been established. A nucleated cell dose of 2 x 10<sup>8</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/kg</span> is generally considered to be adequate, and cell doses of as low as 1 x 10<sup>8</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/kg</span> have been used, although three retrospective studies indicated that rates of hematopoietic recovery, transplantation-related mortality, and five-year survival were significantly better when the CD34+ cell dose was &ge;3.0 x 10<sup>6</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], while rates of hematopoietic recovery were significantly worse when the CD34+ cell dose was &lt;1.2 x 10<sup>6</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This generally requires between 700 and 1500 mL of bone marrow for an adult recipient. (See <a href=\"#H10150103\" class=\"local\">'PBPC mobilization'</a> below.)</p><p>While most studies of cell dose focus on the dose of CD34+ cells, transplant outcomes may also be impacted by the number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and na&iuml;ve T cells contained within the bone marrow graft. As an example, in an analysis of 161 recipients of bone marrow grafts enrolled on a prospective trial, those with pDCs, na&iuml;ve CD8+ T cells, or na&iuml;ve CD4+ T cells measuring above the median had superior overall survival at three years (56 versus 35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Grafts with more na&iuml;ve T cells were associated with less severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and similar relapse rates. Grafts with more pDCs were associated with fewer deaths due to GVHD or rejection. These associations were not seen among the 147 patients receiving peripheral blood progenitor cell grafts. Graft T cell dose and pDC dose are not evaluated in routine practice. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow harvest is frequently complicated by mild back or hip pain, fatigue, and transient changes in peripheral blood cell counts. Serious complications of bone marrow harvest are extremely rare and involve mechanical injury, complications of anesthesia, infection, and bleeding. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor#H3421301257\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the hematopoietic cell transplantation donor&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematopoietic stem cells have been detected in the peripheral blood at extremely low levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Hematopoietic growth factor administration (eg, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], or CXCR4 inhibition with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plerixafor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">plerixafor</a>) or recovery from cytotoxic chemotherapy results in up to a 1000-fold or greater increase in circulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The collections used at most institutions contain a mixture of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells and will be referred to as peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) to differentiate them from studies in which only the purified human hematopoietic stem cells were infused.</p><p>PBPC products account for the majority of donor hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic HCT. Following the completion of studies comparing the relative efficacy of different hematopoietic stem cell sources, transplantation with mobilized PBPCs is more common, but bone marrow continues to be utilized, especially for those with standard risk disease. The relative efficacy of different hematopoietic stem cell sources is described separately. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'PBPC versus bone marrow for malignant disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94323189\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors for poor mobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A subset of patients will require multiple apheresis procedures (ie, more than four) to achieve an adequate cell dose. Attempts have been made to predict the likelihood of collecting an adequate dose with the hopes of limiting more aggressive mobilization procedures to those more likely to fail. Factors that appear to predict a more difficult harvest include low circulating CD34+ cells, older donor age, and decreased total blood volume. These factors have been used to predict the ability of G-CSF alone or the combination of G-CSF plus chemotherapy to mobilize a sufficient number of PBPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/21-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-33</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, the minimum steady-state concentration in the peripheral blood required to assure, with 95 percent probability, the successful mobilization and collection of &gt;2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> was 1.4 and 8.9 CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two studies involving patients with a variety of malignancies, a prepheresis concentration of &gt;34 or &gt;40 CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> assured collection by a single conventional-volume leukapheresis of &gt;2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> in 88 and 100 percent of subjects, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, the administration of G-CSF to donors &lt;18 years of age (range 1 to 17) led to CD34+ mobilization in a pattern similar to that observed in donors &ge;18 years of age, although a significantly higher percent of younger patients reached the targeted cell dose with only one apheresis (56 versus 39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A phase II study found that a single dose of pegylated G-CSF (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> resulted in adequate mobilization in 83 percent of children &lt;18 years undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell collection for autologous transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Our usual approach is to use G-CSF alone for the mobilization of allogeneic donors and to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> plus G-CSF for autologous mobilization. We reserve the use of plerixafor for patients who fail to mobilize adequate numbers of CD34+ cells with either G-CSF alone or G-CSF plus chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-donor#H3421301404\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the hematopoietic cell transplantation donor&quot;, section on 'Procedure'</a>.)</p><p>Guidelines regarding the use of myeloid growth factors for PBPC mobilization are available from the American Society of Clinical Oncology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10154961\"><span class=\"h4\">G-CSF stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most allogeneic donors, we mobilize PBPCs with G-CSF alone. Our usual approach is to treat the donor with G-CSF at a dose of 10 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day, with hematopoietic stem cell mobilization usually occurring between days four and six [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. Most donors can be collected in a single apheresis session, but occasionally multiple apheresis procedures may be needed to achieve the desired dose of at least 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">CD34+cells/kg</span> body weight. (See <a href=\"#H94322163\" class=\"local\">'Optimal CD34 cell dose'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal methodology for mobilizing PBPCs has yet to be defined, and several different approaches have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. In one randomized study, G-CSF was given either in a single daily dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg,</span> or in divided doses of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> twice per day to normal donors undergoing collection for allogeneic transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The latter strategy led to a higher yield of CD34+ cells and required fewer apheresis procedures, without increasing toxicity or cost. Use of a longer-acting recombinant G-CSF (pegylated recombinant G-CSF, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegfilgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pegfilgrastim</a>), which requires less frequent dosing, has also resulted in successful mobilization but is not commonly used for this purpose in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. In two other studies, doses between 20 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day improved the CD34+ cell yield, thereby reducing the number of days of apheresis required to reach the collection goal of more than 2.5 or 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10155095\"><span class=\"h4\">Mobilization after chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) is also observed after recovery from cytotoxic chemotherapy. The addition of growth factors, such as G-CSF, results in a synergistic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>]. While a variety of mobilization schemas have been developed that exploit this phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/50,51,53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51,53-57</a>], the standard approach is to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (typically 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> along with G-CSF 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> (rounded to the nearest vial size). This approach has been safely and consistently applied to a number of different disease settings with relatively few toxicities and excellent collection of CD34+ cells. While the addition of chemotherapy can provide further cytoreduction for patients with malignancies, it can also result in complications (eg, febrile neutropenia, hemorrhagic cystitis). As such, the combination of chemotherapy with growth factors is only appropriate in the autologous transplant setting.</p><p>The general impression that mobilization following chemotherapy plus growth factors is superior to growth factors alone is supported by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first is a crossover trial in which each of 29 patients was randomly assigned to receive two different progenitor cell mobilizations in random order, separated by a two-week washout period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>G regimen &ndash; GM-CSF on days 1 to 12 plus G-CSF on days 7 to 12</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>C regimen &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclophosphamide</a> on day 1 (plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mesna</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) followed by G-CSF on days 3 to 14</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The C regimen resulted in mobilization of 2.7-fold more CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> than the G regimen.

As such, one attractive approach to reduce the incidence of GVHD is to eliminate T lymphocytes from the donor inoculum prior to infusion of the bone marrow. Early studies with T cell depletion that reduce GVHD have been associated with an increase in graft failure, delayed immune reconstitution, disease relapse, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder; as a result, there is no significant overall improvement in disease-free survival. Subsequent studies have been more favorable with a reduction in GVHD risk and excellent overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/136,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">136,137</a>].

The bone marrow product is generally used fresh and infused through a central vein over a period of several hours. Autologous products are almost always cryopreserved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>].

With bone marrow infusions, there is occasional fever, however, most patients tolerate the infusion similar to a blood transfusion. In those instances in which ABO mismatched bone marrow is infused, hemolytic reactions may occur which are treated in standard fashion by administering fluids and diuretics.</p><p>With the infusion of cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cells, minor toxicities such as fever, cough, nausea, vomiting, flushing, headache and occasional bronchospasm are relatively common and self-limited.

With the emergence of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) and umbilical cord blood, alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells are available. The optimal source and composition of the hematopoietic stem cell product continues to be an area of active clinical investigation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the autologous setting, most transplant groups use PBPCs in the majority of cases. The optimal hematopoietic stem cell dose can be calculated using enumeration of CD34+ cells. As an example, the total number of cells collected as determined by the total nucleated cell count can be multiplied by the percentage of CD34+ cells determined by FACS analysis of the product. In this way, the total number of CD34+ cells can be calculated; this is then divided by the recipient weight to arrive at the number of CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span>. (See <a href=\"#H10150103\" class=\"local\">'PBPC mobilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the allogeneic setting, the situation is considerably more complex. The optimal product has yet to be determined with respect to the use of bone marrow versus PBPCs. PBPCs engraft more rapidly than bone marrow, but the increased T cell load may result in higher rates of GVHD, particularly chronic GVHD. In the setting of malignancy, many centers have decided to utilize mobilized PBPCs for advanced stage patients and bone marrow for standard risk patients. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'PBPC versus bone marrow for malignant disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative merits of unrelated donor cells versus cord blood versus haploidentical donors remains to be determined, and the choice amongst these different hematopoietic stem cell products varies by transplant center. However, both donor sources appear to be acceptable, which improves the likelihood of finding a donor for patients in need.
