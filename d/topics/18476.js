There are different types of vaginal cancer, depending on the cells involved.</p><p>This article discusses cancer that starts in the vagina. But women can also get cancer in the vagina after cancer from another part of the body spreads to the vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670209075\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of vaginal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women with vaginal cancer have no symptoms. They find out they have it when their doctor or nurse does a routine Pap test to check for cancer of the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). During a Pap test, a doctor or nurse places a metal or plastic device called a &quot;speculum&quot; in the vagina. The speculum holds the walls of the vagina open, so that the doctor or nurse can see the cervix. Then he or she uses a small brush to collect cells from the cervix.</p><p>When vaginal cancer causes symptoms, the most common symptom is abnormal bleeding from the vagina. The bleeding usually happens after sex or in women who have already gone through menopause. Menopause is the time in a woman's life when she stops having her monthly periods.</p><p>Other symptoms of vaginal cancer can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid coming out of the vagina that is watery, bloody, or bad-smelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain when urinating, blood in the urine, or feeling the need to urinate often</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble having bowel movements, black-colored bowel movements, or feeling the need to have a bowel movement when your bowels are empty</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not vaginal cancer. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670209107\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for vaginal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for vaginal cancer, your doctor or nurse will do a pelvic exam. He or she might use a special magnifying lens called a &quot;colposcope&quot; to see the vagina more clearly.</p><p>During the exam, he or she will do a test called a biopsy. This involves taking a small sample of tissue from the area that looks like cancer. Then another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670209122\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began, and, if so, how far.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670209137\"><span class=\"h1\">How is vaginal cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the stage of your cancer, how big the cancer is, and where it is in your vagina. Your treatment will also depend on your age, other medical problems, and whether you might want to get pregnant in the future.</p><p>Treatment for vaginal cancer includes one or more of following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Vaginal cancer is usually treated with surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and upper part of the vagina. This is called a &quot;radical hysterectomy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78941 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells. Sometimes, the radiation comes from a machine that is outside the body. Other times, the radiation comes from tiny seeds or capsules that are put in the body, near the cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for a group of medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670209175\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will be checked every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow-up tests usually include pelvic exams and tests (similar to Pap tests) to check the cells in the vagina for cancer.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean your vaginal cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670209190\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my vaginal cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your vaginal cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more surgery or chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670209205\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant in the future?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have not yet gone through menopause and want to have a baby in the future, talk with your doctor before starting treatment. Some women can still get pregnant after being treated for vaginal cancer. But a woman can't get pregnant after some types of treatment, such as a hysterectomy, radiation therapy, or some types of chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670209220\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for vaginal cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1670209235\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pap-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pap tests (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopause-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Menopause (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cervical cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachytherapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brachytherapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preserving-fertility-after-cancer-treatment-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preserving fertility after cancer treatment in women (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colposcopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colposcopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adult-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adult women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
