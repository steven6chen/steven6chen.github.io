The soft tissues in the body include the muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and fat.</p><p>A soft tissue sarcoma happens when normal cells in a soft tissue change into abnormal cells and grow out of control. There are many types of soft tissue sarcomas. The type depends on the kind of soft tissue the cancer grows from.</p><p>Soft tissue sarcomas are more common in adults than in children. They can grow anywhere in the body, but they happen most often in the arms or legs. They can also grow in the belly, or on the belly or chest wall.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205488114\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a soft tissue sarcoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom is a lump that grows slowly over weeks to months. The lump doesn't usually cause pain.</p><p>Having a lump doesn't always mean you have a soft tissue sarcoma. But if you have a lump that doesn't go away, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p>Other symptoms of a soft tissue sarcoma depend on where the cancer is in your body. For example, a soft tissue sarcoma in the belly can cause belly pain, bloody bowel movements, or make you feel full after eating only a small amount of food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205488121\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a soft tissue sarcoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check if a lump is a soft tissue sarcoma, doctors usually do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. Doctors can do different imaging tests, including an X-ray, MRI scan, or CT scan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A biopsy &ndash; During a biopsy, your doctor will take a small sample of tissue from the lump. Then another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope to see if it has cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205488128\"><span class=\"h1\">What is soft tissue sarcoma staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out whether a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment will depend a lot on the type and stage of your soft tissue sarcoma, and where it is in your body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205488135\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a soft tissue sarcoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with a soft tissue sarcoma have one or more of the following treatments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Doctors can sometimes do surgery to remove the soft tissue sarcoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines &ndash; These include medicines called &quot;targeted therapies&quot; that work only for cancers that have certain characteristics. Your doctor might do tests to see if your soft tissue sarcoma might respond to these types of medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205488142\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will be checked every so often to see if the soft tissue sarcoma comes back. Follow-up tests usually include exams and imaging tests. You should also watch for new lumps, because a new lump could mean the soft tissue sarcoma has come back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205488149\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the soft tissue sarcoma comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the soft tissue sarcoma comes back, your doctor might treat it with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or targeted therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205488156\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for a soft tissue sarcoma can involve making many choices, such as what treatment to have.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H205488220\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
