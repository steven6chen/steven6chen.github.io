Synonyms include the terms striae, stretch marks, and striae atrophicans. Striae gravidarum are striae distensae occurring secondary to pregnancy.</p><p>There are two main types of striae distensae, <strong>striae rubra</strong> and <strong>striae alba</strong>. Striae rubra are the earliest presentation of striae distensae and are characterized by an erythematous to violaceous color (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101441%7EENDO%2F67682%7EDERM%2F101442\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101441 graphicRef67682 graphicRef101442 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Over time, striae rubra evolve into striae alba, which appear hypopigmented, atrophic, and scar-like (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101443%7EDERM%2F101444\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101443 graphicRef101444 \">picture 2A-B</a>). Common locations for striae distensae are the abdomen, breasts, medial upper arms, hips, lower back, buttocks, and thighs.</p><p>Although typically asymptomatic, striae distensae may be disfiguring and psychologically distressing to patients. Various topical and procedural modalities have been employed for the treatment of striae distensae. (See <a href=\"#H49256006\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1410828814\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of striae distensae will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49255982\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic data on striae distensae in the general population are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/1-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-11</a>]. Reported incidences have ranged from as low as 11 percent in normal men to up to 88 percent in pregnant females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>]. Predisposing factors include pregnancy, adolescent age, drug exposure (eg, topical or systemic corticosteroids), underlying disease (eg, Cushing's syndrome), and surgery (eg, breast augmentation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. A more extensive list of associated conditions is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101453 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Studies specifically exploring risk factors for striae distensae secondary to pregnancy (striae gravidarum) suggest that striae gravidarum occur more frequently in women with a family history of striae gravidarum, higher prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), higher weight gain during pregnancy, higher birth weight and gestational age, multiple gestation pregnancies, polyhydramnios, or a lack of chronic diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101445%7EDERM%2F101446\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101445 graphicRef101446 \">picture 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/3,5,6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6,14,15</a>]. Increased maternal age seems to protect against striae gravidarum, suggesting counterintuitive differences in stretching ability between older and younger skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a series of 800 primiparas examined postpartum for striae gravidarum, 84 percent of 51 women under age 20 developed striae gravidarum compared with only 24 percent of 195 women age 30 or older (odds ratio 28.25, 95% CI 11.04-72.27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The findings of a study of 299 Caucasian women suggest that the distribution of striae distensae prior to pregnancy may be an indicator of risk for the development of striae gravidarum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the study, primiparous or multiparous women who reported&nbsp;striae distensae&nbsp;on the breasts prior to their most recent term delivery were more likely to report the development of striae gravidarum than patients who did not (71 versus 29 percent). In contrast, women who reported striae distensae on the thighs prior to pregnancy were less likely to report striae gravidarum than other women (23 versus 77 percent). An elevated risk for striae gravidarum is also proposed for women born prematurely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Further study is necessary to confirm these findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49255988\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of striae distensae is not well understood and is likely multifactorial. Physical factors resulting in increased tension on the skin, intrinsic alterations in skin structure or function, and hormonal factors may be involved.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical factors </strong>&ndash; A role for mechanical stress on the skin is suggested by the observation that striae often develop in sites experiencing rapid increases in girth (as occurs in pregnancy), rapid weight gain, pubertal growth spurts, and exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Altered skin structure or function </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Striae distensae do not develop in all skin sites subjected to mechanical stress or in all individuals. Therefore, specific characteristics of skin in affected areas may influence development. Reduced migration and proliferation of fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] reduced procollagen and fibronectin gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], marked disruption of the elastic fiber network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and the emergence of thin, disorganized tropoelastin-rich fibrils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] have been detected in biopsies of affected skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Genetic alterations in connective tissue may contribute to striae distensae. Striae distensae are a common finding in Marfan syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormonal factors </strong>&ndash; The common occurrence of striae distensae in pregnancy and Cushing's syndrome contributes to the theory that hormonal factors influence development of the condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67682\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67682 \">picture 1B</a>). Potentially relevant observations include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased expression of estrogen receptors, androgen receptors, and glucocorticoid receptors are present in striae distensae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum cortisol elevation leads to alterations in collagen and elastic fibers through increased protein catabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. An example of this is seen in Cushing's syndrome, where increases in corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), ACTH, and subsequent increases in cortisol levels lead to generalized protein breakdown, causing skin and muscle&nbsp;atrophy&nbsp;and loss of bone. Cortisol increases free amino acids in serum by inhibiting collagen formation, decreasing amino acid uptake by muscle, and inhibiting protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lower serum levels of relaxin (a hormone that can decrease collagen production and increase collagen breakdown) are detected at 36 weeks gestation in women with striae gravidarum compared with women without this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is proposed that the resulting reduced elasticity of connective tissue contributes to greater risk for elastic fiber disruption and striae formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49255994\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Striae distensae may initially appear as edematous striations that evolve to the red-to-purple flat or atrophic plaques known as <strong>striae rubra </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101441%7EENDO%2F67682%7EDERM%2F101442\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101441 graphicRef67682 graphicRef101442 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Striae rubra eventually progress to <strong>striae alba</strong>, hypopigmented scar-like depressions with fine wrinkling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101443%7EDERM%2F101444\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101443 graphicRef101444 \">picture 2A-B</a>). This progression often occurs over the course of 6 to 10 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Striae alba persist indefinitely and may become more prominent with age as skin thins and loses additional elasticity. In patients with dark skin, striae distensae may also be dark gray to black (striae nigrae) or bluish (striae caerulea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Striae distensae usually occur in a symmetrical distribution. The striae are typically oriented along skin tension lines and are a few millimeters to 1 centimeter in diameter. Common locations for involvement are the abdomen, breasts, thighs, and buttocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The lower back, calves, medial upper arms, and hips are additional frequent locations. Striae gravidarum tend to develop in the second and third trimester of pregnancy and commonly occur on the abdomen, breast, or thighs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101445%7EDERM%2F101446\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101445 graphicRef101446 \">picture 3A-B</a>). Patients with Cushing's syndrome may have particularly prominent and widely distributed striae. Striae distensae secondary to topical corticosteroid use often occur in intertriginous areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1584124806\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histopathologic findings of striae rubra and striae alba differ. Striae rubra exhibit flattening of the epidermis with loss of rete ridges. An inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes and histiocytes may be present in the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The centers of early striae rubra may also show a reduction in normal collagen, elastin, and fibrillin content in the dermis while thick, tortuous elastic fibers reside at the periphery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Electron microscopy may demonstrate mast cell degranulation, macrophage activation, and elastolysis in the mid-dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Striae alba exhibit histopathology similar to that of an atrophic scar, with epidermal atrophy, loss of rete ridges, and thin dermal collagen bundles arranged parallel to the skin surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1584118371\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of striae distensae usually can be made based upon visual examination. Linear, atrophic plaques in susceptible sites (eg, abdomen, breasts, buttocks, thighs) are characteristic. Skin biopsy is usually not necessary.</p><p>The evaluation of patients with striae distensae should include questions to determine the most likely cause for striae development. We routinely inquire about common causes, including pregnancy, rapid weight gain or loss, rapid growth, bodybuilding exercise, and medications (particularly topical or systemic corticosteroids).</p><p>Patients with associated systemic signs or symptoms may require further evaluation to rule out an underlying medical condition. As examples, supraclavicular fat pads, skin atrophy, wide purplish striae, and proximal muscle weakness suggest Cushing's syndrome, and an unusual distribution of striae distensae in a tall patient with arachnodactyly and aortic abnormalities should raise suspicion for Marfan syndrome. A list of additional conditions to consider during the patient evaluation is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101453 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1584118378\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Striae are usually easily recognized based upon the characteristic linear configuration and distribution, which limits the differential diagnosis. The major disorder in the differential diagnosis is linear focal elastosis, also known as elastotic striae.</p><p><strong>Linear focal elastosis</strong> is an uncommon disorder characterized by the development of multiple raised linear bands that are usually yellowish in color and horizontally arranged on the lower back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101454\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101454 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Biopsy may demonstrate aggregated or fragmented elastic fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The etiology and pathogenesis is unclear. Linear focal elastosis may represent an excessive regenerative process of elastic fibers, ie, a keloidal repair of striae distensae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, <strong>anetoderma</strong>, a disorder that presents with well-circumscribed, atrophic-appearing, depressed, wrinkled, flaccid, or pouch-like protrusions may enter the differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67581\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67581 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Anetoderma lacks the long linear atrophic bands characteristic of striae distensae. Individual areas of anetoderma are typically 1 to 2 cm in diameter. Anetoderma may occur as a primary skin disease or as a result of a preceding inflammatory process.</p><p>In pregnant women, the development of erythematous, very pruritic papules or plaques within striae (particularly on the abdomen) should raise suspicion for pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81605\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81605 \">picture 6</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatoses-of-pregnancy#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatoses of pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49256006\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Striae distensae are non-life-threatening and asymptomatic. Therefore, treatment is not necessary for all patients.</p><p>For patients who desire treatment, treatment can be challenging. The goal of treatment is to reduce color or texture discrepancies between striae and adjacent normal skin. No therapeutic intervention induces complete resolution.</p><p>Multiple topical and procedural therapies are used for striae distensae. However, a paucity of high-quality trials and a lack of a reliable, validated, and widely accepted tools to assess striae severity and responses to treatment have precluded definitive guidelines for the best approach to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012631739\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to treatment is influenced by the clinical findings (striae rubra versus striae alba) and patient preferences regarding the mode of treatment. Our preferred interventions are pulsed dye lasers, fractional lasers, and topical retinoids, as these are among the most studied and most successful therapies.</p><p>For patients with striae rubra, we often utilize pulsed dye lasers for initial treatment because these lasers target hemoglobin and a reduction in erythema is cosmetically beneficial. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-tretinoin-topical-all-trans-retinoic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Topical tretinoin</a> is a useful alternative; however, adherence to several months of daily application is usually required and skin irritation is common. We have had the most success with topical retinoids in adolescent patients when started soon after the development of striae. Our patients with striae alba are often managed with fractional laser therapy because this treatment may improve skin texture and hypopigmentation. Some striae rubra may also respond to fractional lasers.</p><p>Treatment results are unpredictable and vary from no improvement to significant improvement in patients treated with similar regimens. Thus, expectations for treatment outcome and potential adverse effects should be thoroughly discussed with patients prior to the initiation of treatment. In particular, patients with skin phototypes IV to VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 2</a>) are at increased risk for dyspigmentation after laser treatment. Strict adherence to sun-protective measures is recommended after laser therapy to reduce risk for dyspigmentation.</p><p>In pregnant women, treatment of striae distensae is usually deferred until after delivery because of concerns regarding the effects of various therapies on the fetus. In particular, topical retinoid therapy is avoided during both pregnancy and breastfeeding. Data on the prevention of striae distensae in pregnant women is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H1410828814\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012631951\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulsed dye lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The target chromophore of pulsed dye lasers is hemoglobin, a characteristic that is advantageous for reducing erythema in striae distensae. Pulsed dye lasers may also induce modest texture improvement, as evidenced by an increase in dermal collagen and elastin content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions#H3923207\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions&quot;, section on 'Pulsed dye laser'</a>.)</p><p>Data from uncontrolled and comparative studies suggest that treatment with a 585 nm or 595 nm pulsed dye laser can yield mild to moderate improvements in the appearance of striae distensae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/38-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-43</a>]. While striae rubra may be more likely to exhibit improvement after pulsed dye laser therapy than striae alba (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101447\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101447 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/39,41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41,43</a>], both types of striae may improve after a series of treatments.</p><p>Pulsed dye laser therapy is usually performed every four to six weeks. Purpura lasting one to two weeks is a potential side effect. Whether pulsed dye laser doses either at high enough energy or short enough pulse durations to induce purpura are necessary to achieve improvement in striae remains to be seen. Additional potential side effects include postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, blistering, and rarely scarring. Treatment of patients with skin phototypes IV to VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 2</a>) should be <strong>avoided or performed with caution</strong> because of risk for longstanding dyspigmentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012636774\"><span class=\"h3\">Fractional lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonablative and ablative fractional lasers both may improve skin texture and dyspigmentation in striae distensae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53757\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53757 \">figure 1</a>). The efficacy of these therapies was compared in a trial in which women with post-pregnancy abdominal striae alba were given three treatments with a 1550 nm nonablative fractional laser on one randomly-selected side of the abdomen and three treatments with an ablative fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser on the contralateral side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Four weeks after the final treatment, photographic assessment revealed good or fair improvement in 8 of 22 sites (36 percent) treated with the nonablative fractional laser and 12 of 22 sites (55 percent) treated with the ablative fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser. The difference in effect was not statistically significant.

Tissue remodelling resulting in increased epidermal thickness, dermal thickness, and collagen and elastin fiber deposition often occurs for months after fractional laser therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. A larger study with a longer follow-up period may have demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the two treatments.

However, ablative fractional laser therapy may require fewer treatments. </p><p>In general, we prefer to treat with nonablative fractional lasers to minimize risk for complications. This is particularly true when treating non-facial sites because risk for laser-induced dyspigmentation and scarring is elevated in non-facial skin. In addition, a shorter recovery period may be beneficial when treating large areas of skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012647560\"><span class=\"h4\">Nonablative fractional lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncontrolled studies document modest to marked benefit in the appearance of striae distensae after nonablative fractional laser therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101448%7EDERM%2F101449\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101448 graphicRef101449 \">picture 8A-B</a>). Although some degree of improvement appears to be common, very good or excellent responses seem to occur less frequently. Beneficial responses to 1540 nm, 1550 nm, and 1565 nm devices have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/45-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-52</a>]. Treatment regimens vary.</p><p>Whether striae rubra or striae alba are more likely to respond to nonablative fractional laser resurfacing is unclear. Studies have reported responses to both types of striae distensae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>] as well more favorable responses in patients with striae alba [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a prospective study of 22 women given two treatment sessions with a 1550 nm fractional laser for striae distensae secondary to pregnancy or weight gain, marked clinical improvement occurred in 6 patients (27 percent) one month after treatment, all of whom had striae alba [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Mild improvement was documented in the remaining 16 patients, all of whom presented with striae rubra. In contrast, striae rubra responded well to fractional laser therapy in a series of 10 patients given up to eight treatments with a fractionated 1550 nm fractional laser for new-onset striae distensae on the breast secondary to breast augmentation. Marked improvement in striae rubra was present in all patients four weeks after the final treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The ideal regimen for nonablative fractional laser therapy for striae distensae is unknown. We typically administer a series of three to six once-monthly treatment sessions in an attempt to maximize efficacy. Treatment is administered in the office with topical anesthesia and forced air cooling for comfort. Energy and density settings should be reduced in patients with skin phototypes V or VI to minimize risk for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.</p><p>Posttreatment sunburn-like erythema, edema, and rough desquamation occurs for one to two weeks after treatment on non-facial sites. Additional potential side effects include postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and prolonged erythema or edema. Dermatitis, impetigo, and purpura are rare complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012647338\"><span class=\"h4\">Ablative fractional lasers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies evaluating ablative fractional laser therapy for striae distensae are limited and primarily have included patients with striae alba. In a retrospective study of 27 women with striae alba (skin phototype IV) given a single treatment with a fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser system, blinded assessors of clinical photographs noted marked or near-total improvement in striae distensae in 14 patients (59 percent) two months after treatment and lesser improvement in an additional nine patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A prospective study evaluating the effects of a novel fractional CO<sub>2</sub> device on striae distensae and other disorders found variable results. After three to four treatments, three of five patients had no improvement, one had moderate improvement, and one had advanced improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Combination treatment with a pulsed dye laser and an ablative fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser may be more beneficial for striae alba in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Fractional ablative laser therapy can be performed in an office setting with local anesthesia; however, some patients require the use of systemic anxiolytics and narcotic pain medication intraoperatively. For safety, treatment density should be much lower on non-facial sites as compared with facial sites, and it should be applied over four to eight passes to avoid overlap and skip areas. The authors routinely use 5 to 15 percent total density coverage when treating patients with skin phototypes I to IV, and use a lower density range for higher energy treatments and patients with skin phototype V or VI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 2</a>). While treatment with fractional ablative lasers in patients with skin phototypes IV and higher is controversial due to the risk of pigmentary alteration and permanent scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/striae-distensae-stretch-marks/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>], laser experts may be able to safely treat these patients at very low density settings.

Because collagen remodelling may occur for several months after each treatment, treatments are usually given at four- to six-month intervals.</p><p>On non-facial sites, recovery involves approximately one week of serosanguineous discharge and crusting followed by an additional one to two weeks of desquamation and additional one to two months of erythema. Potential complications of ablative fractional laser therapy include prolonged erythema, infection, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and scarring. Local wound care, close clinical follow-up, aggressive sun protection, and antimicrobial and antiviral prophylaxis (where appropriate) can help reduce the risk of complications.

Striae rubra precede striae alba and are characterized by an erythematous to violaceous color.

Common sites for striae distensae are the abdomen, breasts, medial upper arms, hips, lower back, buttocks, and thighs.
