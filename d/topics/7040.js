Most symptomatic patients with PC have advanced, incurable disease at diagnosis. Even in those with apparently resectable tumors, prognosis is poor. Given that outcomes may be better following resection of small invasive cancers, it is hoped that screening and detection of asymptomatic, early, potentially curable PC and its precursors will improve outcomes. Individuals at increased risk for PC based upon family history or an identifiable genetic predisposition are potential targets for selective screening and curative or preventive treatment.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology and genetic basis of familial PC and familial PC-associated genetic syndromes, the diagnostic tests used for screening, and the risks and benefits of screening for PC. A more detailed discussion of epidemiology and risk factors for PC, and the clinical evaluation and staging workup of newly diagnosed PC, are addressed separately.
