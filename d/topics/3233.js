Available evidence is inconclusive because no randomized trials have compared the outcomes of induction of labor in women with prior cesareans to those of women who undergo either planned repeat cesarean delivery or expectant management.

These factors affect the duration of induction, probability of vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC), risk of uterine rupture, and maternal-fetal risks if induction is prolonged.

Factors associated with a higher chance of vaginal birth (eg, prior vaginal delivery, favorable cervix) when labor is induced are similar for women undergoing a trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery (TOLAC) and women who have not had a prior cesarean. In one large study of women undergoing induction, vaginal birth occurred in 91 percent of women with a prior vaginal delivery and a favorable cervix (Bishop score &ge;6), 77 percent of women with a prior vaginal delivery but an unfavorable cervix, 69 percent of women with no prior vaginal delivery but a favorable cervix, and 45 percent of women with no prior vaginal delivery and an unfavorable cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Most studies of the outcome of labor induction in women with prior cesarean deliveries have compared those undergoing induction with those experiencing spontaneous onset of labor. The body of evidence from these studies indicates that induction is associated with a lower chance of vaginal delivery than spontaneous labor (vaginal delivery rate 68 versus 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]), but this comparison does not have clinical relevance, as the true alternative to labor induction is expectant management. In one study of over 12,000 women with singleton gestations &ge;39 weeks and one low transverse cesarean delivery that used this clinically relevant comparison, women undergoing induction of labor at 39+0 to 39+3 weeks without an acute obstetric medical indication were more likely to deliver vaginally than those managed expectantly (73.8 versus 61.3 percent; odds ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H626360154\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF LABOR PROGRESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with a previous cesarean delivery, the overall duration of labor appears to be approximately two hours longer in women who are induced than in those who experience spontaneous labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This difference appears to be due primarily to a longer latent phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Therefore, when making the diagnosis of a protraction or arrest disorder in the active phase in women who undergo induction of labor after cesarean delivery, it is reasonable for clinicians to apply the same criteria as in women without a previous cesarean delivery.

It should be noted, however, that this association has not been reported consistently: In one study of over 11,000 women, an unfavorable cervix at the time of labor induction was not associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of prostaglandins &ndash; Induction with prostaglandins appears to be associated with a higher risk for uterine rupture than induction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>.

Also, it should be noted that even when increases in risk of rupture for induction versus spontaneous labor (or expectant management) were statistically significant, the absolute increases were relatively small. Thus, oxytocin for induction of labor in women desiring a TOLAC is not absolutely contraindicated and is an appropriate option when performed for standard obstetrical indications. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) acknowledges that induction of labor is an acceptable option for women undergoing TOLAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In this study, the rate of uterine rupture was similar between women in spontaneous labor or who were induced without the use of prostaglandin but was significantly higher among women induced with prostaglandin.

In addition, the increased risk of rupture may be related to characteristics of women who receive prostaglandins rather than to the drug itself; as an example, women who receive prostaglandins are much more likely to have an unfavorable cervix than women induced with oxytocin or who enter labor spontaneously. Although some studies describe outcomes for labors induced with oxytocin alone, few describe outcomes for use of prostaglandins alone. In one such study, prostaglandins alone were not associated with uterine rupture, but sequential use of prostaglandin and oxytocin was associated with uterine rupture (OR 3.07, 95% CI 0.98-9.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>A randomized trial on use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> for cervical ripening or labor induction in women with previous cesarean births was stopped early because of safety concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This trial and several case reports have led many investigators to conclude that misoprostol may be associated with a higher risk of uterine rupture than other prostaglandins and therefore should not be used in women attempting TOLAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-ripening-and-induction-of-labor-in-women-with-a-prior-cesarean-delivery/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15274278\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL RIPENING AND INDUCTION IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15274284\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal demise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall risks and benefits of induction in the setting of a prior cesarean delivery are different when there has been a fetal demise and thus the fetus is not at risk of harm from uterine rupture. Management of fetal demise in a woman with a prior cesarean delivery is reviewed separately.

Our approach in these cases is the same as that described above for labor induction (see <a href=\"#H2658796958\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above). Women with a favorable cervix are offered induction with amniotomy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> or repeat cesarean delivery; women with an unfavorable cervix are offered cervical ripening with a balloon catheter followed by amniotomy and oxytocin or repeat cesarean delivery. As noted above, counseling should take into account a variety of factors, including chances of vaginal birth after cesarean and future reproductive plans. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1420910277\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
