Early treatment will also reduce your chances of transmitting the virus to others.</p><p>This article discusses the early signs and symptoms of HIV and the groups that are at risk for becoming infected with HIV. A separate article discusses testing for HIV.

This may occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During sexual contact with an infected person, especially if you have unprotected vaginal or anal sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By sharing needles or syringes used by an infected person</p><p/><p>Transmission from a pregnant woman to her baby may occur during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding, although this is uncommon with the use of HIV medications during and after pregnancy.</p><p>HIV infection is NOT spread by casual contact.</p><p>Certain individuals may have an increased risk of HIV infection, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men who have sex with men</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection drug users who share needles or &quot;works&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual partners of people who are infected with HIV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with a history of a sexually transmitted disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Victims of sexual assault (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-after-sexual-assault-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Care after sexual assault (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men and women who have unprotected sex with multiple partners</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men and women who exchange sex for money or drugs or have sex partners who do</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anyone who is accidentally stuck with a needle or sharp in a health care facility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who received a blood transfusion or other blood products before 1984</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HIV SYMPTOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4614778\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms of early HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early symptoms of HIV infection develop in 50 to 90 percent of people who are infected, usually beginning two to four weeks after exposure to HIV. The initial group of signs and symptoms is referred to as primary or acute HIV infection.</p><p>Because the signs and symptoms of primary HIV may be similar to other common illnesses such as the flu, most people do not initially realize that they have HIV. However, HIV infection is highly contagious at this early stage because there are large amounts of the virus in the blood and other bodily fluids. Recognizing symptoms early, being tested for HIV, and starting HIV treatment as soon as possible can help to decrease the risk of transmitting HIV to another person.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Body-wide symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common body-wide signs and symptoms of acute HIV include fever (temperature above 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C), sore throat, headache, and muscle and joint pain. These flu-like symptoms last approximately two weeks.</p><p>During the second week of the illness, most people also have painless swelling of certain lymph nodes, including those in the armpits and in the neck. Although the lymph nodes decrease in size after the first few weeks, swelling can linger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin, mouth, genital symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people also develop a rash of the skin about two to three days after fever. The rash usually affects the face, neck, and upper chest or may be more widespread. The rash usually lasts approximately five to eight days.</p><p>One characteristic feature of acute HIV infection is open sores or ulcers. These sores or ulcers can develop in the mouth, the esophagus (the tube that extends from the mouth to the stomach), the anus, or the penis. The ulcers are usually painful. However, only a small proportion of those with acute HIV develop these sores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Digestive symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with acute HIV infection develop nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite, and weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A dry cough is usually the only respiratory symptom associated with primary HIV infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4614817\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms of advanced HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If HIV is not treated, the virus will cause progressive weakening of the immune system, a process which occurs at different rates in different people. Once significant damage to the immune system has occurred, which typically takes at least several years, patients with HIV can become infected with other organisms that usually don&rsquo;t cause illness in people with normal immunity. These &ldquo;opportunistic infections&rdquo; can cause serious disease in patients with advanced HIV infection. Depending on the opportunistic infection, symptoms may include shortness of breath, blurred vision, fevers, and weight loss.</p><p>One of the most common opportunistic infections is yeast infection of the mouth or esophagus. Yeast infections are caused by <em>Candida</em>, a fungal organism that is normally found on the skin and in the mouth, intestinal tract, and vagina in healthy individuals. Certain yeast infections can occur in people without HIV, (eg, vaginal yeast infections) although people with HIV are at a higher risk for this and other types of opportunistic infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-yeast-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaginal yeast infection (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidiasis of the mouth, also known as thrush, causes cream-colored, slightly raised patches in the mouth, soreness, and easy bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidiasis of the esophagus may cause difficulty swallowing</p><p/><p>However, with diagnosis and treatment of HIV, the immune system can improve. Then the risk of opportunistic infections goes down. While the immune system is recovering, certain medications can help prevent any opportunistic infections from occurring in the first place. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Preventing opportunistic infections in HIV (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTING FOR HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV testing is the only way to determine if you are infected with HIV. Some avoid testing because they are worried about the possibility of a positive test result.</p><p>However, testing is encouraged because treatment for HIV is highly effective and is generally well tolerated. In addition, learning about the infection can improve your chance of living longer and being healthier. Furthermore, knowing your HIV status and taking precautions can greatly reduce your risk of transmitting the virus to others.
