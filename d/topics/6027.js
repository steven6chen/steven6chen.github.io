The mortality rate was 1.7 to 2.4 per 100,000 women. In the United States, as with other developed countries, uterine cancer was the most common gynecologic malignancy, with over 60,000 new cases and over 10,000 deaths from the disease in each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (lining of the uterus) is the most common histologic site and type of uterine cancer. </p><p>The main risk factor for endometrioid endometrial carcinoma is an excess of endogenous or exogenous estrogen without adequate opposition by a progestin (eg, postmenopausal estrogen therapy without a progestin).

Uterine cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries; for women through age 74 years, the incidence is 14.7 per 100,000 and mortality rate is 2.3 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In developing countries, it is the second most common gynecologic malignancy (cervical cancer is more common); for women through age 74 years, the incidence is 5.5 per 100,000 and mortality rate is 1.5 per 100,000. </p><p>In the United States (US), uterine cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy and has a higher incidence than the average for developed countries. This may be attributable to increased obesity or other risk factors in the US population.

Based upon data from the US national cancer database, Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), the incidence of uterine cancer from 2009 to 2013 was 25.4 per 100,000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The incidence rate increase was higher in blacks, likely because black women in the US appear to undergo hysterectomy at higher rates than white women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, mortality was almost twofold higher in blacks than in whites (7.1 versus 3.9 per 100,000), possibly due to a higher incidence of aggressive cancer subtypes, as well as issues of access to and quality of healthcare services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>The average age of diagnosis of uterine cancer in the US is 62 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Multiple case-control and prospective studies have shown an increased incidence of endometrial carcinoma, with the relative risk ranging from 1.1 to 15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The risk is related to both estrogen dose and duration of use. Although some reports suggest that endometrial carcinoma in these women is less aggressive than in hormone nonusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], others have found an increased risk of metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy#H533431036\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Low-dose estrogen'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H383248\"><span class=\"h4\">Estrogen-progestin postmenopausal hormone therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma with estrogen therapy can be significantly reduced by the concomitant administration of a progestin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p>In general, combined estrogen-progestin preparations do not increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia. One notable exception is based on analysis of unpublished data from the Postmenopausal <span class=\"nowrap\">Estrogen/Progestin</span> Interventions (PEPI) Trial, which showed a statistically significant increase in endometrial hyperplasia after two years of cyclic combined therapy (3.3 versus 0 percent in the placebo group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/17,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25,26</a>]. The regimen used in this trial was conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) 0.625 mg daily plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> 10 mg for 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">days/month</span>. The reporting of summary data for all histologic types of endometrial hyperplasia is a limitation of this analysis, since atypical hyperplasia is most likely to be associated with carcinoma. A further limitation of this study was inclusion of only oral therapy; thus, it is uncertain whether the results can be generalized to non-oral hormone therapy (patches or vaginal rings). Summary data for the risk of endometrial cancer were not reported for most interventions in this analysis because there were too few events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-endometrial-hyperplasia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia&quot;, section on 'Histopathology and classification'</a>.)</p><p>It appears that most regimens of combined estrogen-progestin postmenopausal hormone therapy do not increase the risk of endometrial carcinoma. This was illustrated by the Women's Health Initiative randomized trial, which compared continuous estrogen-progestin therapy with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The trial found that more women in the hormone therapy group required endometrial biopsies to assess vaginal bleeding (33 versus 6 percent for placebo), but there was no significant difference in endometrial carcinoma risk between the two groups (hazard ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.48-1.36). However, some data suggest that cyclic regimens may increase endometrial cancer risk. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks#H256689856\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;, section on 'Ovarian cancer'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks#H256690730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;, section on 'Protective effect of progestins'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptomatic vaginal atrophy is treated with low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy (vaginal administration of a low dose) rather than systemic estrogen therapy.

The risk of endometrial cancer in premenopausal women on tamoxifen has not been established. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> is a selective estrogen receptor modulator with both agonist and antagonist properties, depending upon the individual target organ and circulating levels of serum estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In breast tissue, it blocks estrogen stimulation and is used for prevention and treatment. </p><p>The endometrial activity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> appears to depend upon menopausal status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. For postmenopausal women, the increased risk of endometrial cancer with tamoxifen use is well established. This effect is dose and duration-dependent. For premenopausal women, however, there is a lack of evidence that tamoxifen increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This was demonstrated in the following studies: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of two large randomized trials including over 20,000 women evaluated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> use for five or more years for breast cancer prevention (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 and International Breast Cancer Intervention Study-1 trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Tamoxifen compared with placebo resulted in a significantly increased risk of uterine cancer for women &ge;50 years old (2.6 versus 0.8 percent; relative risk [RR] 3.32, 95% CI 1.95-5.67), but not for women &lt;50 years old (0.3 versus 0.3 percent; RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.53-2.65). An important limitation of this analysis is that it was underpowered to detect a difference in the &lt;50 age group. In that age group, there were very few events (13 in the tamoxifen group and 11 in the placebo group). Further study of this issue is needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of individual patient data from 20 randomized trials including over 20,000 women compared women with breast cancer who were treated with approximately five years of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> with those who did not receive tamoxifen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Overall, the risk of endometrial cancer was increased with increasing tamoxifen use (rate ratio 2.40). When analyzed by age groups, the increased risk of endometrial cancer with tamoxifen use was significant only in women age 55 or older: ages 55 to 69 (0.9 versus 0.2 percent; rate ratio 2.96); 45 to 54 (0.5 versus 0.2 percent; rate ratio 1.75); &lt;45 (0.1 verus 0.1 percent; rate ratio 1.04). The risk of endometrial cancer persisted after discontinuation of tamoxifen. The usual duration of use of tamoxifen was five years, but over 15 years, women aged 55 to 69 years who had used tamoxifen continued to have a higher incidence of endometrial carcinoma than those who had not (3.8 versus 1.1 percent). </p><p/><p>The effect of a progestin on the risk of endometrial cancer due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> has not been well studied. Many women have progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer, and use of a progestin would raise concern regarding increasing the risk of recurrence. A meta-analysis of two randomized trials found that use of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel intrauterine device</a> decreased the incidence of endometrial polyps, but was underpowered to detect a difference in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma or breast cancer recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Women on the standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> dose (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/d)</span> who develop endometrial carcinoma do not differ from other women with endometrial carcinoma in terms of stage and histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend routine screening for endometrial carcinoma in women on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> but advises that women be counseled about the risks associated with tamoxifen, be monitored closely for symptoms of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, and undergo evaluation if symptoms of endometrial carcinoma are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Phytoestrogens are nonsteroidal compounds that occur naturally in many plants, fruits, and vegetables and have both estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties. Most studies, including randomized trials, have not found an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer with phytoestrogen supplements or dietary intake, and some have found a decreased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of seven comparative observational studies including 3516 women with endometrial cancer found that high soy intake compared with low soy intake was associated with a significantly decreased endometrial carcinoma risk (odds ratio [OR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>Most randomized trials that have addressed this issue have had only 6 to 12 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A potential increase in the risk of endometrial cancer was found in the trial with the longest follow-up period. The trial assigned 376 postmenopausal women to receive soy isoflavone supplements (150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo for five years and found a significantly higher rate of endometrial hyperplasia (detected by endometrial biopsy) in the soy intake group (3.8 and 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, the quality of this trial was limited, since the total number of events was small and the malignant potential of the findings was uncertain (there were only six cases endometrial hyperplasia, five of which were simple and one of which was complex).

A limitation of the study is that most women use OCs with 50 mcg ethinyl estradiol, rather than the &le;35 mcg in most pills in current use. </p><p/><p>The benefit of hormonal contraceptives is likely due to the progestin component, which suppresses endometrial proliferation. Studies have found that progestin-only contraceptives (eg, depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a>, progestin implants, progestin-releasing intrauterine devices) provide endometrial protection against development of endometrial neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/134-136\" class=\"abstract_t\">134-136</a>]. As an example, a large national registry study of this approach from Finland reported on over 98,000 women ages 30 to 49 using the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (20 mcg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> daily; Mirena) for treatment of menorrhagia and found a decreased incidence of endometrial carcinoma (observed to expected ratio 0.50) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. </p><p>Use of progestin-only contraceptives for treatment of endometrial hyperplasia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-endometrial-hyperplasia#H3742888096\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of endometrial hyperplasia&quot;, section on 'Progestin therapy administration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2830444\"><span class=\"h2\">Increasing age at last birth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Childbearing at an older age, independent of parity and other factors, was associated with a decreased risk of endometrial carcinoma in a meta-analysis of individual data from 17 studies that included over 8000 cases of endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>]. A significant decrease in risk was found per five years of increasing age at last birth (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.85-0.90); rate of endometrial cancer in women with last birth at age &lt;25 years was used as the reference standard. As an example, women who last gave birth at age 35 to 39 years had a 32 percent decrease in risk (95% CI 0.61-0.76).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2482190994\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breastfeeding appears to be associated with a decrease in the risk of endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/139,140\" class=\"abstract_t\">139,140</a>]. For example, a meta-analysis of 17 studies included 8981 women from several countries with endometrial cancer compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. Ever-breastfeeding was associated with an 11 percent reduction (odds ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98). In terms of average duration of breastfeeding per child, it appeared that at least three months were required to be associated with decreased endometrial cancer risk, and the degree of risk did not continue to decrease after six to nine months. The association with ever-breastfeeding was not impacted by greater parity, body mass index, or histologic subtype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-and-economic-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal and economic benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking is associated with a decreased risk of developing endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women; obviously, the major health risks associated with tobacco use far outweigh this benefit. The effect in premenopausal women is uncertain. In a meta-analysis of 34 prospective and case-control studies, the risk reduction in current and former smokers was significant after (relative risk [RR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.65-0.78), but not before (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88-1.28) menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. The mechanism suggested for this effect is that smoking stimulates hepatic metabolism of estrogens, leading to a reduced incidence of endometrial abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H333024\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet and exercise</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18452296\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased physical activity appears to be associated with a decreased risk of endometrial carcinoma. In one meta-analysis including 33 studies and over 19,000 endometrial cancer cases, the risk was significantly decreased in women with high compared with low physical activity (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.75-0.85) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. This was also found in a meta-analysis of nine prospective studies, which found a significant decrease in the rate of endometrial carcinoma for women with high compared with low recreational (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.93) and occupational (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.83) physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. Several plausible biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain a possible association between high levels of physical activity and reduced cancer risk; these include decreased obesity and central adiposity and favorable changes in immune function and in endogenous sexual and metabolic hormone levels and growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3340233\"><span class=\"h3\">Coffee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of comparative studies found a decreased risk of endometrial carcinoma proportional to the quantity of coffee consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. The reductions in risk were: low-to-moderate coffee drinkers, RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.78-0.97) and heavy coffee drinkers, RR 0.64 (95% CI 0.48-0.86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3340245\"><span class=\"h3\">Tea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of seven comparative studies reported a decreased risk of endometrial carcinoma proportional to the quantity of tea consumed; however, a subgroup analysis found that the decrease in endometrial carcinoma was statistically significant only with consumption of green tea (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9), but not with black tea (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/147,148\" class=\"abstract_t\">147,148</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H333032\"><span class=\"h3\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No association has been found between vitamin D and endometrial carcinoma risk; some data suggest that use of calcium supplements may be protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>].
