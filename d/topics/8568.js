This topic will discuss the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and treatment of hypothyroid myopathy. Other neurologic manifestations of hypothyroidism are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONGENITAL HYPOTHYROIDISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome describes infants with typical features of cretinism associated with diffuse muscular hypertrophy and muscle weakness that is predominantly proximal. These infants have motor and cognitive developmental delay, constipation, myxedema, enlarged tongue, and coarse hair and skin typical of cretinism. Despite a very muscular, almost muscle-bound appearance, they are in fact weak and often have difficulty with sitting and head control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-deficiency-disorders#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine deficiency disorders&quot;, section on 'Cretinism'</a>.)</p><p>Serum creatine kinase (CK) and other muscle enzymes are often elevated in these infants. The electromyogram may be normal or show scattered low amplitude motor unit potentials in involved muscles. Muscle biopsy shows variable muscle fiber size with predominantly type I fiber atrophy. There is also increased interstitial connective tissue related to the duration of the hypothyroidism and abnormal glycogen accumulation. Muscle fiber necrosis and inflammation are not prominent features of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Treatment with thyroid hormone results in prompt improvement in muscle strength and normalization of serum CK concentrations, even in infants with longstanding congenital hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ADULT HYPOTHYROIDISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle involvement in adults with hypothyroidism is common; in one series, 79 percent of patients with hypothyroidism had muscle complaints (weakness, cramps, myalgias) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with more severe or longstanding untreated hypothyroidism are more likely to develop clinically significant muscle disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3235562969\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of hypothyroid myopathy is not understood. A variety of effects on cellular function and metabolism occurring in hypothyroidism may contribute to the development of muscle symptoms and abnormal muscle function.</p><p>Thyroxine (T4) affects energy metabolism. T4 deficiency leads to abnormal glycogenolysis, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, and triglyceride turnover, which in turn impair muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. These effects are reflected in selective atrophy of Type II fibers, which are more dependent on glycolysis for their energy supply. Type I hypertrophy may be a compensatory response. With severe or prolonged oxidative damage, muscle cell injury and rhabdomyolysis may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The fact that the degree of weakness often does not correlate with the biochemical severity of hypothyroidism suggests that muscle injury, rather than impaired muscle function alone, plays a prominent role in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Serum muscle enzyme elevations in hypothyroidism, which occur in the absence of weakness, myalgias, or structural muscle abnormalities, appear to be due to changes in muscle cell membrane permeability, although the basis for this change is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Reduced clearance of CK probably also plays a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Animal studies have also studied the role of thyroid hormone in gene expression of several skeletal muscle proteins, including myosin ATPase, AMP-activated protein kinase, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/4,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical and laboratory manifestations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Elevated serum creatine kinase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum creatine kinase (CK) elevation occurs in most (57 to 90 percent) patients with hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. The degree of CK elevation does not clearly correlate with the severity of other clinical manifestations of muscle disease, but some have found a correlation between CK and serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, in asymptomatic patients, CK elevation is usually mild, less than 10 times greater than normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>CK elevation may be present for several years before clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism appear. Hypothyroidism should be excluded in patients with an unexplained increase in serum CK of skeletal muscle origin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Myalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonspecific muscle stiffness or diffuse myalgias, often exacerbated after exercise, are common manifestations of hypothyroidism and may be associated with serum muscle enzyme elevations. In one series, more than 40 percent of patients had neuromuscular complaints at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle pseudohypertrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse muscle hypertrophy occurs infrequently in adults. When accompanied by stiffness, weakness, and painful muscle cramps, this is known as Hoffmann's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Affected patients have generalized muscular hypertrophy and variable degrees of weakness. The skin and subcutaneous tissues have a thickened, doughy appearance. Serum muscle enzymes are usually elevated. Signs of hypothyroidism are usually readily apparent and longstanding in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Proximal myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients develop a slowly progressive, symmetric proximal muscle weakness. Shoulder and hip girdle muscles are most commonly affected. Occasionally hypothyroid myopathy is more fulminant, with marked serum muscle enzyme elevations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/16,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20-23</a>]. A single case of camptocormia due to hypothyroid myopathy involving primarily paraspinal muscles has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>On examination, deep tendon reflexes are characteristically described as &quot;hung-up&quot; due to delayed muscle relaxation. Other coexisting clinical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism may be present. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Rhabdomyolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been several case reports of extremely high elevations of serum CK and rhabdomyolysis associated with hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/9,10,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,25-27</a>]. In some cases, rhabdomyolysis appears to have been precipitated by vigorous exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] or concurrent statin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Renal failure may occur as a secondary complication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statin-muscle-related-adverse-events#H107314231\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statin muscle-related adverse events&quot;, section on 'Hypothyroidism, hypovitaminosis D, and other disorders'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Myoedema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myoedema (or &quot;mounding&quot;) refers to a small lump rising on the surface of a muscle when it is struck with a percussion hammer. This phenomenon, which is characteristic of hypothyroid myopathy, lasts for 30 to 60 seconds, and is due to a sustained contracture associated with delayed relaxation, because of slow reaccumulation of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Myoedema is not specific for hypothyroidism as it can also occur in malnutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any of the above clinical symptoms or signs without another known cause should prompt an evaluation for hypothyroidism. TSH is the most sensitive screening test; this should be followed by a thyroxine level if the TSH is elevated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>). This can be sufficient to diagnose hypothyroid muscle disease and institute thyroid replacement therapy.</p><p>Electromyography (EMG) can be helpful, as clinical symptoms and signs do not always distinguish hypothyroid myopathy from inflammatory myositis or other neuromuscular complications. The EMG may be normal in approximately half of hypothyroid patients with proximal muscle weakness, or it may demonstrate myopathic changes with increased low-amplitude, polyphasic potentials, and rarely increased insertional activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/5,16,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,34,35</a>]. Myoedema elicited with muscle percussion is electrically silent, distinguishing it from myotonia. When performed to distinguish hypothyroid myopathy from inflammatory myositis, a lack of fibrillation potentials on electromyogram with relatively normal appearing motor units suggest the former diagnosis. </p><p>Muscle biopsy is not usually required. When performed, the muscle biopsy may be normal or may show a variety of nonspecific changes, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/4,16,17,23,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16,17,23,36,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II fiber atrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I fiber hypertrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased numbers of internal nuclei</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Core-like structures in type I fibers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitochondrial inclusions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycogen accumulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autophagic vacuoles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myofibrillar disorganization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild, focal necrosis and degeneration of muscle fibers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasional mild inflammatory infiltrates</p><p/><p>Pathologic changes do not correlate well with the severity of the myopathy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CK levels fall quickly with treatment, normalizing over a few weeks, generally before TSH levels normalize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/16,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,38,39</a>]. Clinical symptoms, particularly weakness, recover more slowly. In one study, muscle complaints resolved in 79 percent of patients over a median time of 5.5 months. At one year, 21 percent of patients continued to complain of weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Persistent weakness at six years following initiation of treatment was described in one patient with severe hypothyroid myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothyroid-myopathy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle disease is a frequent complication of congenital and adult-onset hypothyroidism.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myopathic weakness in congenital hypothyroidism occurs in association with other manifestations of cretinism, is accompanied by prominent muscle hypertrophy, and responds to thyroid replacement.
