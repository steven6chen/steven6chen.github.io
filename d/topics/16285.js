In this original report, it was noted that patients had neurologic deficits on presentation or a history of transient paresthesias, numbness, or paralysis. Approximately half of patients presented with delayed onset (up to four days after injury) of permanent paralysis.</p><p>However, with the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), approximately two-thirds of cases described as SCIWORA in the literature actually have demonstrable injury to the spinal cord, soft tissue components of the spinal column (ligaments, capsules, or muscles), or vertebral body endplate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. With the increased availability of MRI, the diagnosis of &quot;real&quot; SCIWORA or spinal cord injury without <strong>neuroimaging</strong> abnormality is less common. The term &quot;spinal cord injury without computed tomography evidence of trauma&quot; (SCIWOCTET) is sometimes used to describe adult patients with neurologic findings suggestive of spinal cord injury with normal anatomic alignment and no bony abnormalities seen on CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Nonetheless, it is important to remember that patients with blunt trauma who have a history of transient neurologic symptoms that have resolved by the time of initial evaluation may have a significant injury to the spinal cord <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spinal column despite a normal physical examination and normal spine radiographs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CT.</p><p>SCIWORA should <strong>not</strong> be confused with cervical &quot;burners&quot; or &quot;stingers&quot;, which refers to peripheral brachial plexus injuries, typically at the C5-C6 level resulting from trauma to the neck and shoulder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115917 \">table 1</a>). When children present with transient neurologic symptoms and normal neurologic exams, it may be difficult to distinguish between brachial plexus injuries and SCIWORA, leading to over-reporting of SCIWORA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The thoracolumbar spine is partially braced by the rib cage and is less commonly deformed without fracture. </p><p>Relative to adults, children have several distinct anatomic features that predispose them to hypermobility of the spinal column in the absence of apparent bony injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In infants, the ratio of head size and weight to the rest of the body is large, and the neck musculature is weak and limited in its ability to prevent hypermobility of the cervical spine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spinal ligaments and capsules are elastic, allowing them to undergo significant stretching without tearing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intervertebral disc and annulus have a high water content that allows for longitudinal expansion without rupture during spinal column distraction (as much as 2 inches [5 cm] in the neonate).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vertebral body facet joints are oriented horizontally and are shallow which permits significant bony motion during flexion, extension, or rotary neck movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior wedging of the vertebral bodies in infants and young children allows for increased forward bony movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children have underdeveloped uncinate processes until approximately 10 years of age and thus, have less restriction of lateral and rotary spinal column movements. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large diameter of the spinal canal relative to the diameter of the spinal cord, resulting increased mobility of the spinal cord within the canal.</p><p/><p>These anatomic features are most pronounced in infants and children under eight years of age and predispose them to axial cervical spine (occiput through second cervical vertebrae) and spinal cord injuries involving the first through third cervical segments after blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Older children and adolescents are more likely to have subaxial cervical spine injuries (fourth through eighth cervical cord segments). Full maturation of the cervical spine is not typically achieved until about 16 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H991129\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four mechanisms of injury have been described for SCIWORA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperextension</strong> &ndash; With hyperextension of the cervical spine, the posterior interlaminar ligaments impinge upon the spinal canal causing up to 50 percent narrowing of the canal diameter. At the same time, spinal cord shortening leads to thickening in the cervical region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Further extension leads to bony displacement that, especially in the infant or young child, may be transient and followed by the spinal column springing back into normal bony position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperflexion</strong> &ndash; The mechanism of spinal cord impingement following hyperflexion is similar to that of hyperextension. The anterior interlaminar ligaments impinge upon the cervical spinal canal causing narrowing at a point where spinal cord thickening occurs. Further flexion leads to transient bony displacement with further injury to the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Distraction</strong> &ndash; Longitudinal distraction is most commonly seen in infants and children younger than five years of age. In these patients, the spinal column can be stretched well beyond the tolerance of the spinal cord without subsequent radiographic bony damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Distraction with quadriplegia has occurred in neonates after breech extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], in young children restrained only by lap belts who are thrown forward during a front end motor vehicle collision, and in other rapid <span class=\"nowrap\">acceleration/deceleration</span> events. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spinal cord infarction</strong> &ndash; Vertebral artery occlusion from transient impingement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arterial dissection during deformation of the spinal column may result in ischemia of the spinal cord. This is best evidenced in populations of neonates who experience failure of the atlanto-occipital articulation during delivery and upper cervical spinal cord infarction. Hypotension due to massive blood loss may also result in spinal cord infarction. As an example, delayed thoracic spinal cord infarction was demonstrated in a five year old child who suffered high-energy thoracoabdominal trauma with retroperitoneal injury and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26107899\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCIWORA has been described in victims of all ages after blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/1,5,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,11,12</a>]. Depending upon the study population and reference standard, reported incidence has ranged from 4.5 to 35 percent among children with spinal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/3,5,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,13-15</a>], and approximately 0.2 percent of all pediatric trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. Among all cervical spine injuries in children, spinal cord injuries in the absence of other associated vertebral or ligamentous injuries are common, representing up to 15.5 percent of injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Most cases of SCIWORA occur in the cervical spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/3,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,16</a>]. Thoracic SCIWORA has also been described but is less common than in the cervical region due to the splinting reinforcement provided by the rib cage. When it occurs, thoracic SCIWORA is usually associated with extreme traumatic forces (eg, lap-belt complex associated with high-speed motor vehicle collisions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. In addition, SCIWORA has been reported in the lumbar region in school-aged children and adolescents but is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Mechanisms of injury associated with SCIWORA vary by age and are associated with neurologic outcome. In young children under eight years of age, SCIWORA is most commonly caused by motor vehicle collisions, falls, and child abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In older children, motor vehicle collisions and sports, especially gymnastics, diving, horseback riding, American football, and wrestling, predominate. Worse neurologic outcome is associated with injury during motor vehicle collisions and falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26107906\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SCIWORA is made when patients demonstrate clinical findings of spinal cord injury in the absence of spinal column injury on plain radiographs and computed tomography. Approximately two thirds of these patients will have evidence of injury to the spinal cord, soft tissue components of the spinal column (ligaments, capsules, or muscles), or vertebral body endplate on magnetic resonance imaging. </p><p>Patients with SCIWORA may have definite evidence of spinal cord injury on physical examination as manifested by abnormal vital signs (eg, apnea or bradycardia with hypotension [spinal shock]), neck or back pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic deficits (eg, paresthesias, paralysis, or loss of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'History'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>However, although challenging to elicit in young children, transient neurologic symptoms (eg, paresthesias, weakness) by history or resolving during emergency evaluation may also indicate injury to the cervical or thoracic spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>]. Approximately one-quarter of children with SCIWORA may experience delayed onset of neurologic signs minutes to days after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>], which can range from complete paralysis to partial neurologic deficits. The latent period may range from 30 minutes to four days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/1,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20,21</a>], making prompt diagnosis difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, prompt evaluation with imaging should occur up to four days after the initial injury if transient neurologic symptoms are reported. (See <a href=\"#H26107920\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic evaluation'</a> below.) </p><p>For this reason, it is critical to have a high index of suspicion and to ask specifically about transient symptoms in any verbal child whose mechanism of injury is consistent with cervical or thoracic spine injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H724951997\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCIWORA is differentiated from cervical spine fracture, dislocation, or subluxation by imaging studies performed during the acute phase of management and evaluation. </p><p>When children present with transient neurologic symptoms and normal neurologic exams, it may be difficult to distinguish between cervical brachial plexus injuries (burners or stingers) and SCIWORA. Patients with cervical brachial plexus injuries describe burning pain in the supraclavicular region that radiates down the arm on the affected side in a circumferential, nondermatomal fashion. Unilateral paresthesias, numbness, or weakness may also occur. The discomfort typically resolves within one to two minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115917 \">table 1</a>).

Findings can progress to flaccid paralysis and quadriparesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26107920\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOLOGIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with suspected spine or spinal cord injury should undergo plain radiographs of the cervical spine and any other portion of the spine with evidence of injury and computed tomography of the cervical spine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other region based on physical examination and plain radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64196\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64196 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51439\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51439 \">algorithm 2</a>).

A high index of suspicion should be maintained for patients that present with transient neurologic symptoms, but normal neurologic examination if they are younger than eight years and have a high-risk mechanism (eg, axial load biomechanics or high-risk motor vehicle collisions [death of passenger in same vehicle, patient ejected partially or fully, passenger compartment intrusion &gt;12 inches at sides and &gt;18 inches at the roof]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Such patients may warrant MRI even when presenting in a delayed fashion (eg, the next day) after injury.</p><p>Small observational studies and case reports suggest that the abnormal spinal cord findings on MRI are seen in up to two-thirds of patients with SCIWORA and that lesions requiring operative intervention (eg, vertebral fracture or ligamentous disruption) are frequently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/4,6,14,25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,14,25,27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21711187\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal cord appearance on MRI correlates with prognosis as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal cord findings on MRI connotes a higher probability of persistent neurologic deficits.

Protection of the cervical spine to prevent worsening of an existing spinal cord injury requires restricting motion in both the neck and the body. The neck is placed in a cervical collar, and the body is placed in the supine position, preferably on a soft conforming surface. Infants and young children warrant a cut out in the board or padding under the shoulders to maintain neutral position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F114553\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114553 \">figure 1</a>).

Initially, the airway can be opened with the jaw-thrust maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53277\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53277 \">figure 3</a>). Orotracheal intubation with in-line manual stabilization provides the best approach to secure the airway in trauma victims without causing further cervical spine injury.

Ongoing treatment in patients without operative lesions consists of prolonged external immobilization to permit healing of the presumed ligamentous injury and to prevent exacerbation of the myelopathy (eg, Guilford brace for cervical SCIWORA, thoracolumbar orthosis for thoracolumbar SCIWORA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The duration of bracing in children with SCIWORA is debated, and recommendations vary from no bracing in patients with transient symptoms and an initial normal MRI to a Guilford brace or thoracolumbar prosthesis for three months in patients with persistent deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/3,14,16,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,16,29</a>]. Evidence supporting bracing and restriction of activities for three months derives from one case of recurrent injury with permanent neurologic deficit at 10 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and a metaanalysis of cases of SCIWORA which found that recurrent injury was significantly more common in patients braced for 8 weeks versus 12 weeks (17 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In contrast, a single hospital series of 189 children with SCIWORA reported 21 cases of recurrent SCIWORA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The 85 patients treated with more rigid bracing had recurrent SCIWORA more frequently than did the 97 patients treated with a soft collar or no bracing (15 versus 7 percent, odds ratio [OR] 2.3; 95% CI 0.9-6.0). All patients with recurrent SCIWORA had full neurologic recovery.</p><p>One reasonable approach is to vary the duration of bracing depending upon the presence of neurologic deficits, findings on MRI, and results of nerve conduction studies as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent neurologic deficit, positive MRI, or when performed, abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials &ndash; Rigid brace for three months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient resolved neurologic deficit or symptoms only and normal MRI or somatosensory evoked potentials &ndash; Padded hard collar (eg, Miami J or Aspen cervical collar) for one to two weeks and reevaluation by a neurosurgeon</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26108436\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term SCIWORA is commonly used to describe patients with neurologic findings suggestive of spinal cord injury with normal anatomic alignment and no bony abnormalities seen on plain film <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography of the spine. However, with the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), approximately two-thirds of children with SCIWORA actually have demonstrable injury to the spinal cord, soft tissue components of the spinal column (ligaments, capsules, or muscles), or vertebral body endplate. (See <a href=\"#H26108408\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative to adults, children have several distinct anatomic features that predispose them to hypermobility of the spinal column in the absence of apparent bony injury. (See <a href=\"#H7632003\" class=\"local\">'Pertinent anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCIWORA typically involves the cervical spine and occurs with greater severity in children younger than eight years of age. Motor vehicle collisions, falls, and sports account for most instance of SCIWORA in children. (See <a href=\"#H26107899\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCIWORA may present as definite evidence of spinal cord injury on physical examination or subtle transient neurologic symptoms (eg, bilateral paresthesias, weakness). Approximately one-quarter of affected children may experience delayed onset of neurologic signs minutes to days after injury, which can range from complete paralysis to partial neurologic deficits. (See <a href=\"#H26107906\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SCIWORA is made when patients demonstrate clinical findings of spinal cord injury in the absence of spinal column injury on plain radiographs and computed tomography and differentiates it from cervical spine fracture, subluxation, and dislocation. When children present with transient neurologic symptoms and normal neurologic exams, it may be difficult to distinguish cervical brachial plexus injuries (burners or stingers) from SCIWORA. The table provides a comparison of important features for each condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115917 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H26107906\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H724951997\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed in children who are suspected of having spinal cord injury, but have normal plain radiographs (three views) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography of the cervical spine. A high index of suspicion should be maintained for patients that present with transient neurologic symptoms, but normal neurologic examination if they are younger than eight years or have a high-risk mechanism (falls from a height or motor vehicle collisions). (See <a href=\"#H26107920\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute management priorities in children with spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) consist of (see <a href=\"#H26107927\" class=\"local\">'Initial Management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintain restriction of spinal motion. Protection of the cervical spine to prevent worsening of an existing spinal cord injury requires restricting motion in both the neck and the body. The neck is placed in a cervical collar, and the body is placed in the supine position, preferably on a soft conforming surface. Infants and young children warrant a cut out in the board or padding under the shoulders to maintain neutral position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F114553\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114553 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;, section on 'Techniques'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provide emergency support of airway, breathing, and circulation while treating other life-threatening injuries. The cervical spine should be manually stabilized during airway management to prevent exacerbation of a spinal cord injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874 \">figure 2</a>). Initially, the airway can be opened with the jaw-thrust maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53277\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53277 \">figure 3</a>). Orotracheal intubation with in-line manual stabilization provides the best approach to secure the airway in trauma victims without causing further cervical spine injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction#H2531830830\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;, section on 'Manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Cervical spine immobilization'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Transient loss of spinal cord function can occur following spinal injury due to vasodilatory shock. However, although hypotension can result from neurologic injury, clinicians must first assume that hypotension following trauma results from hemorrhage and ensure appropriate fluid resuscitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Circulation'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Any injury associated with a neurologic deficit or spinal column instability requires emergency consultation with a pediatric spine surgeon or a spine surgery team (often staffed by pediatric orthopedists and pediatric neurosurgeons) to guide supportive care and definitive management of the injury. If consultation is not available onsite, immediate transfer must be arranged to a pediatric trauma center that can provide these services. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (eg, 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> initial loading dose over one hour followed by 5.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/hour</span> for 23 to 48 hours) within the first three to eight hours after injury in those patients with an abnormal neurologic examination is controversial and is discussed in greater detail separately.
