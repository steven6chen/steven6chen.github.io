Breast cancer occurring during pregnancy presents a challenging clinical situation since the welfare of both the mother and the fetus must be taken into account in any treatment planning. In addition, prospective studies of breast cancer during pregnancy are very few, and much of the clinical evidence is limited to retrospective case series and case reports. </p><p>The epidemiology and diagnosis of pregnancy-associated breast cancer will be reviewed here. The treatment and prognosis of pregnancy-associated breast cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-breast-cancer-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational breast cancer: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in nonpregnant and pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Up to 20 percent of breast cancers in women under age 30 are pregnancy-associated, but fewer than 5 percent of breast cancers diagnosed in women under age 50 are detected during pregnancy or in the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Pregnancy-associated or gestational breast cancer is a relatively uncommon event. The incidence of pregnancy-associated breast cancer (for the prenatal to postpartum period) is approximately 15 to 35 per 100,000 deliveries, with fewer breast cancer cases diagnosed during pregnancy than during the first postpartum year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. The incidence of pregnancy-associated breast cancer appears to be increasing as more women delay childbearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p>Women with a genetic predisposition to breast cancer may be overrepresented among pregnant women with cancer, although the available evidence is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In women who inherit BRCA2 (but not BRCA1) mutations, the protective effect of multiparity on breast cancer risk may be lost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Pregnancy itself may transiently increase an individual woman's risk of developing breast cancer, despite its long-term protective effect on the development of breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84659891\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of breast cancers in pregnant women are infiltrating ductal adenocarcinomas, as in nonpregnant women. However, pregnancy-associated breast cancers are predominantly poorly differentiated and diagnosed at an advanced stage, particularly in those diagnosed while lactating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,6,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,16,17</a>]. In addition, women with pregnancy-associated breast cancer may have a higher incidence of inflammatory breast cancer than nonpregnant women, but this has not been consistently observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84659898\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormone receptor expression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most series report a lower frequency of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression in pregnancy-associated breast cancer compared to breast cancer in nonpregnant patients (approximately 25 versus 55 to 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,9,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,16-19</a>].

HER2-positivity should be evaluated just as in nonpregnant patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=her2-and-predicting-response-to-therapy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HER2 and predicting response to therapy in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Making the diagnosis of breast cancer and performing a staging work-up are more difficult for pregnancy-associated breast cancer due to the physiological changes in the breast that accompany pregnancy and lactation, and the desire to limit radiation exposure to the fetus. </p><p>Breast cancer is classified according to the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). Where clinical guidance is provided in this topic, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the AJCC Staging Manual is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>); however, it is recognized that the studies cited may have used previous editions of the staging system, which is a limitation of existing data. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84660113\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic changes in the breast that accompany pregnancy (eg, engorgement and hypertrophy) make physical examination more challenging, interpretation of findings more difficult, and may limit the utility of mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. As a result, diagnostic delays of two months or longer are common in women with gestational breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Such delays may adversely impact outcome, since even a one month delay in diagnosis can increase the risk of nodal involvement by 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Pregnant or postpartum women with breast cancer usually present similarly to nonpregnant women, with a mass or thickening in the breast. Rarely, a nursing infant has refused a breast that harbors an occult carcinoma, leading to an early diagnosis of breast cancer; this has been named the milk rejection sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>The index of suspicion for cancer must be high in pregnant women with a breast mass. A breast mass that persists for more than two weeks should be investigated, although the majority (80 percent) of breast biopsies performed in pregnant women will prove to be benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The differential diagnosis of a breast mass in a pregnant or lactating woman includes epithelial breast cancer, a lactating adenoma, fibroadenoma, cystic disease, lobular hyperplasia, milk retention cyst (galactocele), abscess, lipoma, hamartoma, and rarely, leukemia, lymphoma, phyllodes tumors, sarcoma, neuroma, or tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of a palpable breast mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mammography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mammography is not contraindicated in pregnancy as the average glandular dose to the breast for a two-view mammogram (200 to 400 millirad) provides a negligible radiation dose to the fetus, as long as abdominal shielding is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Abdominal shielding is recommended, although there are no clinical data comparing fetal radiation exposure with or without shielding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mammographic sensitivity is altered by the increased water content, higher density, and loss of contrasting fat in the pregnant or lactating breast. Nevertheless, data suggest that mammography is sufficiently sensitive to diagnose breast cancer during pregnancy and lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,30-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201077861\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast ultrasonography is often the first imaging test ordered to evaluate a breast mass in a pregnant woman. Ultrasonography can determine whether a breast mass is a simple or complex cyst or a solid tumor without the risk of fetal radiation exposure. A focal solid mass is observed in the majority of cases of gestational breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32,33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Breast MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has not been systematically studied for the diagnosis of breast masses in pregnant or lactating women and may be challenging to interpret in the setting of gestational changes to the breast. No harmful effects from MRI without contrast during pregnancy have been reported, but the National Radiological Protection Board advises that MRI be avoided in the first trimester if possible since there is limited experience assessing safety during organogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, breast MR imaging could be considered after the first trimester if further imaging is required for treatment planning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Although gadolinium-enhanced MRI appears to be more sensitive than mammography for detecting invasive breast cancer, particularly in women with dense breast tissue. Studies demonstrate potential fetal harm with gadolinium exposure, with increased incidence of stillbirth, death, and rheumatologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dermatologic manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Gadolinium should therefore should be avoided during pregnancy. </p><p>Gadolinium-enhanced breast MRI may be considered in women who are postpartum at the time of diagnosis, if the mammogram <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrasound are equivocal. The typical MRI appearance of the normal lactating breast has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinically suspicious breast mass requires biopsy for definitive diagnosis, regardless of whether or not a woman is pregnant, and despite negative mammographic or ultrasound findings. Core, incisional, or excisional biopsies can be performed relatively safely during pregnancy, preferably under local anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,37</a>]. Needle core biopsy is the preferred method. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84660395\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Areas at risk for <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinically suspicious for nodal disease should be further evaluated with ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for cytologic confirmation. The safety and efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with pregnancy-associated breast cancer is debated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-breast-cancer-treatment#H84662642\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational breast cancer: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Management of the axilla'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, pregnancy-associated breast cancer tends to be diagnosed at an advanced stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. As in nonpregnant women, locally advanced stage disease [stage III or IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>)] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suspicious symptoms should prompt a complete radiographic staging evaluation. In contrast, women who are asymptomatic and have clinically node-negative, early stage breast cancer may not require formal evaluation of lung, liver, bone, or brain since the incidence of unsuspected metastases is quite low.</p><p>The staging evaluation in breast cancer is discussed separately, as is diagnostic imaging in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, modifications of the standard staging work-up may be implemented to protect the fetus and are reviewed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest x-Rays to evaluate for lung metastases should be performed with appropriate fetal shielding. Abdominal shielding is recommended, although there are no clinical data comparing fetal radiation exposure with or without shielding. The estimated dose to the fetus with chest x-ray is 0.06 millirad. However, the ability to evaluate the lower lung parenchyma using chest radiography may be limited late in gestation when the gravid uterus is pressing against the diaphragm.</p><p>Chest computed tomography (CT) scans are generally avoided during pregnancy because of the large cumulative radiation dose when multiple slices are obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75594\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75594 \">table 2</a>). If further evaluation of the chest is warranted, an MRI of the thorax is preferred. As noted above, use of contrast agents such as gadolinium is avoided during pregnancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver and brain evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal ultrasound for the evaluation of liver metastases is a safe procedure in pregnant women, but is significantly less sensitive than CT or MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. CT scanning of the abdomen or pelvis is generally not performed during pregnancy because of fetal radiation exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75594\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75594 \">table 2</a>). Thus, MRI without contrast is preferred if further visceral organ evaluation is required. Although the National Radiological Protection Board advises that MRI be avoided in the first trimester if possible since there is limited experience assessing safety during organogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], MR imaging could be considered in the first trimester when the benefit exceeds the theoretic risk.</p><p>Should brain metastases be suspected, MRI is the most sensitive way to scan the brain, although, as noted above, the safety of contrast agents such as gadolinium may have adverse effects to the fetus. Information regarding the safety and efficacy of positron emission tomography (PET) in pregnancy is limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radionuclide bone scans are reported to be safe during pregnancy. A &quot;low-dose&quot; bone scan has been described that exposes the fetus to 0.08 rad as compared to the standard 0.19 rad for a conventional bone scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Fetal exposure to radiation may also result from proximity to radionuclides excreted into the maternal bladder; maternal hydration and frequent voiding, or Foley placement can reduce this exposure. Bone scans are not recommended for evaluation of bone disease in the absence of signs or symptoms of bone abnormality.</p><p>As an alternative, skeletal MRI may be considered (without contrast). Since breast metastases are deposited in the red marrow, imaging of the axial skeleton (spine, pelvis, ribs and sternum) will include approximately 80 percent of all metastatic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Alternatively, screening MRI of just the thoracic and lumbar spine may be considered if there are no complaints suggestive of extraspinal bony metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The safety of plain skeletal radiographs is unclear. Although these films result in less than 1 rad exposure to the fetus and have been obtained during pregnancy by obstetricians for pelvimetry measurements and to evaluate for renal stones, even low levels of ionizing radiation may increase the risk of childhood leukemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75594\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75594 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>Alkaline phosphatase increases markedly during pregnancy due to placental production and cannot be used as an indicator of bone metastases. Even bone specific alkaline phosphatase is not a reliable measure of bone disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of cardiac function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although generally not indicated if a woman is younger than 50 years of age and without risk factors for cardiac disease, an echocardiogram (instead of radionuclide ventriculography) may be used to assess baseline cardiac function prior to anthracycline chemotherapy.
