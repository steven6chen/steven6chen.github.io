To meet these goals, pediatric clinicians must know the risk factors for obesity and malnutrition and must understand the normal and abnormal patterns of growth and the changes in body composition during childhood and adolescence. In addition, they must be able to accurately perform and interpret the results of the nutritional evaluation.</p><p>Nutritional assessment is the quantitative evaluation of nutritional status. A comprehensive nutritional assessment has four components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary, medical, and medication history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth, anthropometric, and body composition measurements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory tests</p><p/><p>The measurements of growth are reviewed here.

A normal growth pattern does not guarantee overall health; however, children with abnormal growth patterns frequently have nutritional complications of specific clinical disorders (eg, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease) or poor socioeconomic conditions. Altered growth patterns are a late consequence of nutritional insult, regardless of the cause of nutritional deprivation. Thus, careful surveillance for nutrition problems, particularly in children who are at risk, is necessary for the prevention of nutritional morbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for nutritional assessment in childhood&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries: Clinical assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and head circumference measurements are the mainstays of the nutritional assessment of the child. These measurements are useful only if the clinician is able to correctly interpret them by converting absolute values to relative standards for the appropriate reference population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-growth-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Growth measurements should be plotted on growth charts that provide a reference for the population being measured. Serial measurements must be obtained to determine if the growth pattern is truly abnormal or is a normal variant. Normal variants of growth include constitutional short stature, and the gradual movement between growth curves that sometimes occurs in healthy infants and children during the first 24 months of life (sometimes called &quot;rechanneling&quot;) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Normal growth'</a>). Children whose length, height, or weight measurements fall below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile, above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile, or cross two major centile curves are at nutritional risk and merit further consideration. As an example, if a child's weight falls from the 25<sup>th</sup> to the 10<sup>th</sup> during one year, the clinician should investigate for an explanation, including signs and symptoms of underlying disease. Growth is most rapid in healthy children during early infancy and adolescence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children&quot;, section on 'Normal patterns'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">CDC growth reference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and National Center for Health Statistics <span class=\"nowrap\">(CDC/NCHS)</span> have prepared growth charts based upon data from five national health examination surveys and five supplementary data sources (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsQOVl38wneqFrPw6Saxgudl1K2ioo0T2TlZUbeYYaDMFXAbXc1y7Fe69MdyUWCumTA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5356\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC growth charts</a>). </p><p>On these charts, the normal range is generally defined as between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles, although additional categories are also used (eg, defining a category of &quot;Overweight&quot; between the 85<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">WHO growth standards</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) developed growth standards through the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study to describe normal child growth from birth to five years under optimal environmental conditions (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsQOVl38wneqFrPw6SaxgudkfS9iI+pP2UXZEEzHxOs7DAZNyDYqLwLigJKb3mjLmjQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5356\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">WHO growth charts</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-growth-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. These standards can be applied to all children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and type of feeding. A pooled sample from six participating countries was used for the development of an international standard of growth. In addition, standardized body mass index (BMI) charts for infants to five years of age were developed. The reference lines on the WHO growth charts are either percentile lines or Z-scores; Z-scores are units of standard deviation (SD) from the population mean. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Z-scores'</a> below.)</p><p>On these charts, the normal range is generally defined as between -2 SD and +2 SD (ie, Z-scores between -2.0 and +2.0), which corresponds to approximately the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 98<sup>th</sup> percentiles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83941 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The WHO standards define a population that is somewhat longer and leaner than the <span class=\"nowrap\">CDC/NCHS</span> references; this discrepancy is most dramatic during mid- and late infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-growth-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. When using the appropriate cut-offs (ie, the 5<sup>th</sup> and 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for the CDC charts and the 2.3<sup>rd</sup> and 97.7<sup>th</sup> percentiles for the WHO charts) the prevalence of shortness and overweight are similar for both charts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80048\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80048 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-growth-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the prevalence of underweight (low weight-for-age or low weight-for-height) was lower when using the WHO charts than the <span class=\"nowrap\">CDC/NCHS</span> charts. Thus, the main difference is that the WHO standards are less likely to categorize a child as undernourished as compared with the <span class=\"nowrap\">CDC/NCHS</span> growth references [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-growth-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This probably is because the WHO standards were derived from multiple countries, including those that have a lower obesity rate than the United States, whereas the CDC growth references are derived from the United States' population. </p><p>The WHO charts are considered a growth standard because they describe children raised under optimal nutritional conditions. By contrast, the CDC charts are considered a growth reference because they include children raised in a variety of nutritional conditions in the United States. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31542395\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommended growth charts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As of September 2010, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsQOVl38wneqFrPw6Saxgudlbw1g/Dq+Ng0RwmxurgIon&amp;TOPIC_ID=5356\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC recommends</a> using curves based on the WHO child growth standards for infants and toddlers under two years of age, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">CDC/NCHS</span> growth references for children two years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-growth-in-children/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. </p><p>This approach may cause some children to change categories when they reach 24 months of age (eg, a child may be classified as overweight on the WHO charts at 24 months, but normal weight on the CDC charts). In addition, clinicians should transition from measuring recumbent length to standing height at 24 months of age; to match the standard on which each chart is based, because measurements of recumbent length are approximately 1 cm greater than measurements of stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-growth-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Length or height'</a> below.) </p><p>This recommendation reflects the opinion that the WHO charts represent a healthier standard for children younger than two years of age because they are based on longitudinal measurements in a breastfed population. Thus, use of the WHO charts is less likely to lead to miscategorization of a breastfed baby as being underweight. The CDC and the AAP are collaborating to develop additional guidance for appropriate use of these growth charts for monitoring growth within the United States' population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3606276\"><span class=\"h3\">Infants 0 to 2 years</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On these WHO charts, the normal range is generally defined as between -2 SD and +2 SD (ie, Z-scores between -2.0 and +2.0), which corresponds to approximately the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 98<sup>th</sup> percentiles.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67950%7EPEDS%2F80511\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67950 graphicRef80511 \">figure 2A-B</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50006%7EPEDS%2F63877\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50006 graphicRef63877 \">figure 3A-B</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight for length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53474%7EPEDS%2F73036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53474 graphicRef73036 \">figure 4A-B</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head circumference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58632%7EPEDS%2F74503\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58632 graphicRef74503 \">figure 5A-B</a>) </p><p/><p>Charts combining these curves are also available, and may be most practical for clinical use: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight-for-age and length-for-age (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/who/GrChrt_Boys_24LW_100611.pdf&amp;token=t67uKF87quI+VOGQbp8WYy1qlg8XOLN3MTzfQwAU57BB44jv4h5GPMaOGEGAhZarYsHWrCkrZnYl9OfFn8MunNAMiFoPYVFZybPzPoNrOA0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5356\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">boys</a>;
