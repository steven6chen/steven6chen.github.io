takes time, and ideally this process is completed before the patient becomes critically ill or the need for transplantation becomes urgent. Thus, whenever possible, patients with a progressive lung disease should be referred to a transplant center when they are still able to undergo the standard, relatively extensive multidisciplinary evaluation to determine the potential risks and benefits of lung transplantation in their case. Early referral may identify modifiable risk factors that would influence a patient's candidacy for transplantation or their outcome after transplantation. For example, a patient with class I obesity would have more time to lose weight or a patient with deconditioning could enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation to improve their functional status before listing for transplantation. </p><p>Referral to a transplant center does not mean that the patient will necessarily be listed for transplant. Following the evaluation, the patient, patient's family, and transplant specialists will determine together whether placing the patient on the transplant list would be appropriate.</p><p>Clinical settings outlined by the ISHLT as appropriate for referral for transplantation evaluation vary based on the underlying disease and include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>COPD that is progressive despite smoking cessation, optimization of medications, pulmonary rehabilitation, and supplemental oxygen, a BODE index of 5 to 6 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-bode-index-for-copd-survival-prediction-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>); PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;50 mmHg (6.6 kPa) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;60 mmHg (8 kPa), or FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;25 percent of predicted.

These factors include age, ventilator dependence, previous cardiothoracic surgery, nutritional status, chronic glucocorticoid use, allosensitization, and psychosocial issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726959136\"><span class=\"h2\">Recipient age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An upper age limit for recipient selection has not been established. Age older than 65 has been considered a relative contraindication for lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While the appropriateness of this threshold is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], adults over age 75 are unlikely to be candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Since patients vary enormously at any chronological age, a potential transplant patient's age is not usually a contraindication by itself. Instead, age must be considered in the context of the individual patient's medical comorbidities, overall performance status, and expected outcome.</p><p>The number of lung transplant recipients older than 65 has increased annually in the US; based on Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) data, this age group accounted for 33 percent of all lung transplant recipients in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A separate report found that over 40 percent of all lung transplants performed worldwide from 2006 to mid 2012 were for recipients older than 60 years of age; approximately 10 percent were for recipients older than 65 years of age; and 3 percent were for recipients over 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>As might be expected, recipients older than 60 have a shorter survival than younger recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The median survival after transplantation for those older than 60 range from 3.6 to 4.5 years and for those younger than 50 years range from 6.5 to 6.7 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80159\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80159 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>While older recipients generally have a shorter survival than younger ones, for patients undergoing primary lung transplantation between 2005 and 2012, the risk of mortality at one year for those 70 years or older was not greater than those age 60 to 69 (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.71-1.46) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a separate study, survival statistics for septuagenarians (70s) and sexagenarians (60s) were compared, using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among 543 septuagenarians and 4327 sexagenarians, survivals at one year were 79 percent and 80 percent, respectively. However, survival rates at three years (49 versus 64 percent, p&lt;0.001) and five years (28 versus 48 percent, p&lt;0.001) were significantly lower for septuagenarians. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilator dependence and extracorporeal life support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) were considered relative contraindications to lung transplantation, but there is growing experience using these as a &quot;bridging&quot; strategy for lung transplant candidates who develop respiratory failure while awaiting transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/8,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16-19</a>]. In 2016, 8 percent of lung transplant recipients aged 12 years or older in the United States were supported with mechanical ventilation or ECLS before transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. &#160; </p><p>While invasive mechanical ventilation remains a significant risk factor for mortality after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], multiple reports have demonstrated that carefully selected candidates requiring invasive mechanical ventilation can have satisfactory short and long-term outcomes after lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/8,21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21-26</a>]. However, unstable patients requiring mechanical ventilation before transplantation have a significantly worse survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>When feasible, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is preferred over invasive ventilation because it obviates the need for sedation, and the patient can remain ambulatory and participate in pulmonary rehabilitation. Multiple studies have confirmed satisfactory outcomes after the use of noninvasive ventilation as a bridge to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>ECLS is increasingly being used as a bridge to lung transplantation in patients with pulmonary or cardio-pulmonary failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/8,26,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,26,30-33</a>]. In 2016, approximately 5 percent of all lung transplant recipients in the United States were supported with ECLS before transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A series of 49 patients who received bridging support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and mechanical ventilation had no significant difference in survival compared with those transplanted at the same center who did not require this support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, bridging with ECMO was associated with a greater likelihood of needing postoperative ECMO. </p><p>Carefully selected patients can be supported with veno-venous ECMO while awake and off invasive mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This approach allows patients to undergo physical therapy and maintain an adequate nutritional status. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3953252899\"><span class=\"h2\">Previous cardiothoracic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous cardiothoracic surgery, pleurodesis, or pleurectomy increases the technical difficulty of explanting the native lung and the operative risk of lung transplantation, but are not contraindications to lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/8,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,35</a>]. </p><p>Prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a risk factor for increased mortality following lung transplantation. In a series of 14,791 patients transplanted between 2004 and 2013, 292 (2 percent) had previously undergone a CABG and of these, 181 received a single right lung transplant, 68 received a single left lung transplant, and 43 received bilateral lung transplants (BLT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Prior CABG was a predictor of mortality at one, three, and five years, with an overall hazard ratio of 1.97 (95% CI, 1.23&ndash;3). However, the effect was largely due to increased mortality among those who underwent BLT. </p><p>Simple pneumothorax that was treated by closed tube thoracostomy (with or without pleurodesis), open lung biopsy, or uncomplicated lobectomy are not usually an impediment to transplantation, but more complex cases, such as pleurodesis, must be individually assessed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nutritional status of lung transplant candidates can adversely affect post-transplant survival. Thus, consensus guidelines for recipient selection state that class I obesity (BMI 30 to 34.9 kg per m<sup>2</sup>) is a relative contraindication for lung transplantation, while class II or III obesity (BMI &ge;35 kg per m<sup>2</sup>) is an absolute contraindication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Malnourished candidates may also have a higher mortality risk. </p><p>Multiple studies have identified pretransplant obesity as a significant risk for mortality after transplantation independent of other risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/37-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-44</a>], including the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database demonstrated a 15 percent higher mortality for overweight recipients (BMI = 25 &ndash; 29.9 kg per m<sup>2</sup>) and a 22 percent higher mortality for obese recipients (BMI &gt;30 kg per m<sup>2</sup>) than normal weight recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 512 adult lung transplant recipients, obesity was also an independent risk factor for development of grade 3 primary graft dysfunction within 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter study using multivariate analyses to examine the impact of BMI on one-year survival after lung transplantation, recipients with class I obesity (BMI 30 to 34.9 kg per m<sup>2</sup>) had similar adjusted survival to normal weight and overweight recipients whereas those with class II or III obesity (BMI &ge;35 kg per m<sup>2</sup>) had a significantly increased risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Importantly, this study demonstrated a poor correlation between BMI and adiposity, measured by whole-body dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), suggesting that BMI is a poor measure of obesity in lung transplant candidates. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p>Low BMI has not been a risk factor for mortality after transplantation in the ISHLT registry, although one study found a higher mortality among recipients with a BMI &lt;18.5 kg per m<sup>2</sup> and another found a trend to a higher 90-day mortality among recipients with a BMI &lt;17 kg per m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/37,38,43,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38,43,46</a>].

Perioperative glucocorticoid treatment was prohibited in the first few years of lung transplantation because of concerns about airway anastomosis healing. However, with current surgical techniques, pretransplantation glucocorticoid therapy has not been associated with airway complications, and the use of glucocorticoids before transplantation has not been a significant risk factor for early mortality after transplantation in the ISHLT registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The glucocorticoid dose may be an important determinant of outcomes post-transplant. Studies have generally found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> doses of 0.2 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day are safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].

Antibodies to human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are most commonly induced by blood transfusions, pregnancy, and previous transplantation. However, some allosensitized patients have no history of such sensitizing events; some studies have implicated vaccination as a potential inducer of anti-HLA antibodies, but this remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. </p><p>The original complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay for HLA antibodies has been supplanted by solid-phase immunoassays that are highly sensitive and specific. If HLA antibodies are present, there is a risk of hyperacute rejection if the donor's phenotype includes the reactive HLA. In addition, even low-level donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) that don't result in hyperacute rejection increase the risk of chronic rejection and death after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

However, improved management techniques appear to have reduced the mortality risk of higher PRA levels, perhaps because more specific and sensitive assays have been used in recent years to avoid the reactive HLA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In a single-center study of 304 transplants performed in 2006 to 2012, pre-transplant allosensitization was not associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes after transplantation when the reactive HLA were avoided in the donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Based on experience in kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], regimens to deplete anti-HLA antibodies before transplantation have been tried in patients waiting for lung transplantation. In one study, 18 patients with a calculated PRA &ge;80 percent were treated with a desensitization protocol consisting of plasmapheresis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) in an attempt to deplete anti-HLA antibodies and increase the donor pool before transplantation, but there were no significant changes in the PRA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Nine of the 18 patients were transplanted during the study period; among these, four received organs from donors who did not have the reactive HLA, three from donors with typing that matched low-level HLA antibodies, and two from donors with reactive HLA based only on past antibody testing. Survival after transplantation was comparable to allosensitized recipients who were not treated with this regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. &#160;</p><p>A subsequent study used a desensitization protocol at the time of transplantation, rather than before donor organ acceptance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The protocol consisted of plasmapheresis and IVIG intraoperatively and anti-thymocyte globulin postoperatively. Fifty-three patients who had DSA before transplantation were treated with this regimen and had similar clinical outcomes as patients who were not allosensitized and those who were allosensitized but did not have DSA. However, only five of the 53 patients who had DSA had a positive direct crossmatch suggesting that the antibody detection threshold may be overly sensitive and these antibodies may not be clinically significant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2696722101\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients undergo screening for psychological conditions that might interfere with their post-transplant care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients are evaluated for a history of psychiatric problems, substance addiction (eg, alcohol, tobacco, narcotics), and other issues that might cause nonadherence to the medical regimen.

Thus, an important component of the transplant candidate evaluation is to assess the potential contribution of any comorbid diseases to peritransplant complications and long-term survival. An example of testing done during a lung transplant evaluation is provided in the table.

In addition, some have advocated reserving angiography for patients with multiple risk factors since the majority without risk factors will have normal coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. However, the value of a negative angiogram should not be underestimated, especially in the perioperative period, when hemodynamics are unstable and nonspecific chest pain, positive troponin values from intraoperative cardiac manipulation, and electrocardiographic abnormalities are common.</p><p>At our center, essentially all patients over the age of 45 undergo angiography. This practice is not uniform among transplant programs. Some employ a noninvasive, provocative test for cardiac ischemia as a screen; if this is negative, coronary angiography is not done.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bcc infection is associated with accelerated decline in lung function, making it even more prevalent among transplant candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/102-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-105</a>]. However, certain genomovars, or subspecies, may have greater virulence than others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/91,98,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,98,106</a>]. Patients infected with Bcc, subspecies <em>Burkholderia cenocepacia</em> in particular, have significantly worse survival after transplantation compared to uninfected patients with CF, and the increased mortality is directly attributable to Bcc infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/100,102,107-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,102,107-109</a>].

This possibility was examined in a retrospective study of 11,323 adult lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Race matching decreased the risk adjusted cumulative mortality (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96). Further studies are needed to determine underlying mechanisms for this observation. Race matching is not clinically feasible and, in view of the small effect size, should not be used to guide lung allocation at present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), cystic fibrosis (CF), emphysema due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are the most common diseases that lead to lung transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific guidelines for lung transplantation have been developed by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. These guidelines include consideration of the severity of the underlying lung disease, likelihood of benefit from lung transplantation, presence of comorbid diseases, age of the candidate, ability to participate in an exercise program, nutritional status, and psychosocial support. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General guidelines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of absolute and relative contraindications to lung transplantation have been developed in order to optimize the likelihood of post-transplant survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106889\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106889 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106946\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106946 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early referral of potential lung transplantation candidates to a transplant center is preferred to allow sufficient time for an in-depth, multidisciplinary evaluation process to determine the potential risks and benefits of lung transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1106155515\" class=\"local\">'Timing of referral'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) were historically considered relative contraindications to lung transplantation, but are increasingly used as a &quot;bridging&quot; strategy for lung transplant candidates who develop respiratory failure while awaiting transplant. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Ventilator dependence and extracorporeal life support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As obesity has been a risk factor for mortality post lung transplant, it is recommended that candidates reach a BMI less than 30 kg per m<sup>2</sup> or a weight less than 130 percent of ideal body weight (IBW). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many lung transplant candidates have risk factors for coronary heart disease. The value of noninvasive testing may be limited because of the underlying lung disease. We suggest coronary angiography in all candidates age 45 or older. Good outcomes have been achieved in selected patients who can be revascularized prior to or at the time of lung transplant. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Coronary heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant dysfunction of other vital organs, as might occur with systemic diseases like systemic sclerosis or sarcoidosis, is a contraindication. Certain other special considerations, like prior cardiothoracic surgery, glucocorticoid use, chronic infection, and allosensitization also influence decisions on appropriateness for lung transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Yusen RD, Edwards LB, Kucheryavaya AY, et al.
