In the United States, abortion is a safe and legal option for a person who cannot or choose not to continue a pregnancy.</p><p>Deciding to have an abortion is a very personal decision. Anyone considering abortion should understand the risks and benefits of the various types of abortion, as well as the alternatives to abortion, including parenting and adoption.</p><p>This article will help to explain these issues and will briefly discuss legal abortion procedures, including the recommended follow up. If you have questions or concerns about abortion after reading this article, find a supportive healthcare provider or clinic that provides abortion services. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Where to get more information'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IS ABORTION RIGHT FOR ME?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, 19 percent of pregnancies end in abortion (not including miscarriages) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abortion-pregnancy-termination-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One in four women will have an abortion by the age of 45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abortion-pregnancy-termination-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There are many reasons for considering abortion. Some of the most common reasons include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a baby would interfere with family, work, school, or other responsibilities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot afford to raise a child</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems in relationship with partner</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having problems with husband or partner</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Something is wrong with the fetus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health problems that make pregnancy a problem</p><p/><p>If you are not sure if abortion is the right decision for you, talk to a supportive healthcare provider or find a clinic that provides abortion services. You may also want to talk to a friend, family member, your partner, or someone else you trust. It is important to share your thoughts and feelings about this decision with people who will support you, no matter what you decide. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Where to get more information'</a> below.)</p><p>States vary with regard to how many weeks they allow a pregnant person to have an abortion. In most it is allowed up to &quot;viability&quot; or 24 weeks. If you are under age 18 and live in the United States, you may need one or both of your parents' permission to have an abortion. In most states, if it is not possible to get your parents' permission, you can speak with a judge to get permission for an abortion without your parents' or guardian's approval. Healthcare providers who provide abortions can help you with this process if you need it. Laws for each state are available on the websites of some <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/sfaa.html&amp;token=9ivVAf1HVkBHgW1Q2Y3A4n1V5DusAzfB7WxXN64grMd+jrELqe2Kr27RIewf69V4nEvAkv0ayfP/zVM27g2Hdw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=15750\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">organizations</a>. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Where to get more information'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ABORTION PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two basic ways abortions are performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One is called &quot;medical&quot; or &quot;medication abortion,&quot; meaning that you take medicine to end the pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other is called &quot;aspiration&quot; or &quot;surgical&quot; abortion, meaning that a healthcare provider does a procedure to remove the pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication or aspiration abortion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of abortion procedure you may have depends on a number of factors, including how far along you are in your pregnancy, what types of abortions are available in your area, and your personal preferences. &quot;Early&quot; medication abortion, in which a woman takes medicine by mouth, is most effective if the pregnancy is less than 10 weeks. If the pregnancy is later (beyond 14 to 16 weeks), you may be given medicines that induce labor to cause an abortion. This type of abortion would be performed in a hospital and is usually called &quot;labor induction.&quot; It is not as common as aspiration or early medication abortion.</p><p>Reasons that you might prefer aspiration abortion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You prefer to have the abortion completed in one visit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are not comfortable with heavy vaginal bleeding and passing the pregnancy at home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You would prefer to have anesthesia to minimize pain</p><p/><p>It is important to know that in approximately 2 out of 100 cases, the medication may not work and an aspiration procedure is necessary(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'How effective is early medication abortion?'</a> below.)</p><p>Reasons that you might prefer surgical abortion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You prefer to have the abortion completed in one visit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are not comfortable with the idea of heavy vaginal bleeding and passing the pregnancy at home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You would prefer to have anesthesia to minimize pain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With both medication and aspiration abortion, you will need the following before the procedure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pregnancy test or ultrasound to confirm that you are pregnant and determine how far along the pregnancy is. To determine the current length of your pregnancy, you can use this calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-estimated-date-of-delivery-edd-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood test to determine your blood type and to make sure you do not have anemia. If you have a negative blood type (for example, if you are &quot;A negative&quot;), you will be given an injection of a medication called Rh immune globulin (Rhogam) after the abortion. This helps to prevent complications in future pregnancies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You may be offered testing for sexually transmitted infections. Commonly performed tests include gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV. Testing for syphilis and hepatitis A, B, and C may also be recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You will discuss the risks and benefits of abortion, the available procedures (medication and aspiration or other procedure), and alternatives to abortion (parenting, adoption) with a counselor or clinician. This is an important step; if you have any questions or concerns, this is the best time to ask.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some states, women must wait for a certain amount of time (usually 24 hours) between the counseling, described above, and the abortion. In other states, the abortion can be performed on the same day as the counseling. For information about your state, see <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/sfaa.html&amp;token=9ivVAf1HVkBHgW1Q2Y3A4n1V5DusAzfB7WxXN64grMd+jrELqe2Kr27RIewf69V4nEvAkv0ayfP/zVM27g2Hdw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=15750\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/sfaa.html</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You will discuss options for contraception (&quot;birth control&quot;). After medication or aspiration abortion, you can become pregnant again quickly, even before your next menstrual period. You can start using most methods (pill, patch, vaginal ring, injection, intrauterine device [IUD], implants) on the day of an aspiration abortion.</p><p/><p>With medication abortion, you can start some kinds of birth control on the same day you take the medicines. Other methods, like the IUD, can be inserted soon after the pregnancy has ended, usually within a few days after you take the medicine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-control-which-method-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Birth control; which method is right for me? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY MEDICATION ABORTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early medication abortion usually involves taking two different medications to end a pregnancy. In the United States, early medication abortion may be an option if you are less than 10 weeks (70 days) pregnant (clinics have different policies on this). Medication can also be used for women who are further along in their pregnancy (14 or more weeks), but this type of abortion takes place in the hospital under the supervision of a doctor or nurse. To determine if you can have an early medication abortion, use this calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-estimated-date-of-delivery-edd-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p>Early medication abortion is available in some private health care offices and hospitals, and in most clinics that provide abortion services. The following steps are usually part of this type of abortion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A health care provider will confirm how many days pregnant you are, either by using a calculator or performing a vaginal ultrasound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You will be given two medications, usually mifepristone and misoprostol. Information about these medications is available online (refer to <a href=\"http://www.earlyoptionpill.com/&amp;token=yg3nprUA5eADoEehxhWbpsPuy7y4PUSdPehOoz6DV/6M8GzNkrHKJgdKa7+YsKze&amp;TOPIC_ID=15750\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.earlyoptionpill.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/facts/medical_abortion.html&amp;token=mGCp3jf+U+RF8NnZx3snHmXmL+bML7NBmB10nyjAY1JY3oZHj8msQjvdCUXgv6hCU34jiY9RLa/4DQe2tiLFYZuPOZ9SwmqIbiAH91ap4Pg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15750\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/facts/medical_abortion.html</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You will take the first medication (mifepristone) at the clinic or medical office. You will take the second medication (misoprostol) several hours or up to several days later at home or in another place you choose.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Expected side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain, cramps, and vaginal bleeding are expected side effects with early medication abortion. Some women also have fever, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain and cramps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women will have abdominal pain and cramps after taking the second medication (misoprostol). These cramps may be mild or strong. The pain usually improves after the pregnancy has passed out of your uterus, which for most women happens within 2 to 24 hours after taking the misoprostol.</p><p>You can take 600 to 800 mg of ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) every 6 to 8 hours for pain, if you need it. You can also use a heating pad on your abdomen. Some doctors and nurses also give a prescription for a stronger pain medication to use if needed. If you have severe pain that is not relieved by these treatments, call the clinic where you got the medications or health care provider immediately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is normal to experience vaginal bleeding with an early medication abortion. The bleeding may be heavy, especially in the first few hours after you take the misoprostol. The bleeding usually decreases after the pregnancy tissue passes out of your uterus. It may continue for several weeks after that, but it should be lighter than a menstrual period after the first few days.</p><p>If you are bleeding so heavily that you soak through one menstrual pad per hour for two hours in a row and you are still bleeding, you should call your health care provider or clinic immediately. If you do not have bleeding at all after you take the medications, you should also call your health care provider or clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women experience a mild fever, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea after taking the second medication (misoprostol). This usually goes away quickly on its own without treatment. If you develop a fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C), or if you have chills, vomiting, or diarrhea that does not go away within several hours, call your health care provider or clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">How effective is early medication abortion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early medication abortion is very effective in ending pregnancies up to 70 days (10 weeks). If taken before 10 weeks, it works in 95 to 98 out of 100 people who take it. (It is slightly more effective when taken earlier in pregnancy).</p><p>If early medication abortion does not work in ending your pregnancy, you will need to have an aspiration abortion to remove it. Continuing a pregnancy after taking medications for an abortion is not safe because of the risk of birth defects from the misoprostol. For signs that your abortion was not effective. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'When to seek help after abortion'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ASPIRATION OR &quot;SURGICAL&quot; ABORTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspiration abortion is a procedure that is done in a clinic or hospital to end a pregnancy. The procedure is done by removing the pregnancy tissue through the cervix, which is the opening to the uterus. This procedure does not involve any surgical incisions but may require stretching the cervix (called &quot;dilation&quot;). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester pregnancy termination: Uterine aspiration&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most cases, you can choose to have an aspiration abortion while you are awake, using only local anesthesia, or while you are sedated. Some providers also offer other medicines to reduce pain and anxiety, including medicines you can take by mouth or some that are given intravenously. If you are more than 14 weeks pregnant, you will probably need to have sedation. To determine how far along your pregnancy is, use this calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-estimated-date-of-delivery-edd-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of second-trimester pregnancy termination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A healthcare provider gives local anesthesia by injecting medication into your cervix. This usually causes some mild pain that passes quickly. You will not require an intravenous (IV) line if you have only local anesthesia.</p><p>If you do decide to have sedation, you will have an IV line placed in a vein, and medication will be given to make you relax or feel sleepy. Many people do not remember much about the procedure after the sedative medication is given. You will also be given local anesthesia, after the sedative. General anesthesia (that makes you completely unconscious) is not recommended for abortion in most cases.</p><p>The abortion procedure usually takes between 5 and 20 minutes, and is usually shortest when the pregnancy is early. You will be monitored in a recovery area for about an hour after the procedure (longer if you are given a sedative).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Expected side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and cramping are expected side effects after an aspiration abortion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal pain and cramping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women have some abdominal pain and cramping after an aspiration abortion. You can take 600 to 800 mg ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) every 6 to 8 hours for pain, if needed. Some doctors give a prescription for a stronger pain medication that you can take if needed.</p><p>The pain usually lasts several hours. If you have severe pain that does not get better with these treatments or if your pain continues for more than a few days after the procedure, call the clinic where you had the abortion, or your health care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is normal to have some vaginal bleeding after an aspiration abortion. Usually the bleeding is less than with a menstrual period. The bleeding usually lasts a few days to two weeks, and should become light after the first few days. You may also pass some tissue or blood clots.</p><p>If you are bleeding so heavily that you soak through a menstrual pad in an hour for two or more hours in a row and you are still bleeding, you should call the clinic where you had the abortion or your healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP AFTER ABORTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call the clinic where you had the abortion or your healthcare provider immediately if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are bleeding so heavily that you soak through one menstrual pad per hour for two hours in a row and you are still bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe pain that is not relieved by pain medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have shaking chills or develop a temperature higher than 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C (use a thermometer to measure your temperature).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have foul-smelling or pus-like vaginal discharge.</p><p/><p>In addition, you should be aware of signs that your abortion was not complete. Call your healthcare provider if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You do not have vaginal bleeding after a medication abortion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your pregnancy symptoms (breast tenderness, nausea) do not resolve within one week after your abortion. You should not do a home pregnancy test, even if you still feel pregnant, because it is likely to be positive for up to 6 weeks after having an abortion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You continue to bleed for more than 2 weeks after your abortion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You do not have a menstrual period within 6 weeks after your abortion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different clinicians and clinics make different recommendations, but in general, you should avoid sex or putting anything in your vagina (tampons, douches) for at least a few days to a week after an abortion. This may help prevent infection and give you time to recover.</p><p>About one week after a medication abortion, you should have a follow-up visit with the healthcare provider or clinic where you were given the medication. It is very important to go to this visit to be sure you are no longer pregnant.</p><p>Some abortion providers recommend a routine follow-up visit two to three weeks after an aspiration abortion. At this visit, you can review how you are feeling and discuss contraception (&quot;birth control&quot;). If you have not already started using a contraceptive method, you should discuss what will be best for you at this follow-up visit (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-control-which-method-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Birth control; which method is right for me? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). Sometimes the provider may perform a pelvic exam at that visit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">ABORTION COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Legal abortions are safe and rarely cause serious complications. However, as with any medical procedure, complications do sometimes occur. These can include excessive bleeding, infection, injury to the cervix or uterus (aspiration procedures only), or pregnancy tissue that remains in the uterus. These complications occur in only about 3 out of 100 people who have an abortion, and serious complications occur in less than 1 out of 100 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abortion-pregnancy-termination-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">MYTHS AND FACTS ABOUT ABORTION</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MYTH</strong>: Abortion is dangerous. <strong>FACT:</strong> Legal abortion is one of the safest medical procedures available today.
