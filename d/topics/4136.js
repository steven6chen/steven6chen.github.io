This has been possible because of sophisticated ECG gating and respiratory motion suppression methods that facilitate high-quality cross sectional images of the heart. It is now customary to use the term cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) when referring to MRI of the heart and blood vessels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the many techniques employed on MRI systems, three are the mainstays of clinical CMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spin echo imaging &ndash; Spin echo imaging depicts the tissue structures of the heart as bright and the blood pool as dark (black blood approach). The spin echo method is predominantly used for anatomical imaging, and for identifying the fatty infiltration of the right ventricular free wall frequently seen in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SSFP imaging &ndash; Steady state free precession imaging generates images in which the blood pool appears bright and myocardium dark like the older gradient echo technique. This technique is used to evaluate left and right ventricular cavity sizes and function, ventricular mass, intracardiac shunts, valvular functions, and to detect intracardiac masses. Steady state free precession can generate high temporal (less than 30 msec) and spatial (2mm in-plane) resolution cine images in an 8 to 12 second breathhold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow velocity encoding &ndash; Flow velocity encoding (also known as phase contrast) is a technique that is used to directly measure blood flow and is useful for quantifying the severity of valvular regurgitation and stenosis, intracardiac shunt size, and the severity of arterial vascular stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &ndash; Precise assessment of myocardial dynamics can be performed using radiofrequency (RF) tagging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There is a general trend to develop new methods to perform CMR with less use of gadolinium contrast agents. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used as a means of evaluating myocardial metabolism. The most widely employed approach uses phosphorus-31 (naturally abundant myocardial phosphates) as a means to evaluate the changes in the high energy phosphates (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> triphosphate [ATP] and phosphocreatine [PCr], usually as the <span class=\"nowrap\">PCr/ATP</span> ratio) as the most direct means for detecting myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The inorganic phosphate can be followed to estimate the intracellular pH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newer technologies &ndash; MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) have been combined within one system. These systems have the best technologies for both PET (time of flight [TOF] technology) and MRI. In addition to visualizing both PET and MRI images superimposed with one another, the strengths of each technology are used (ie, improved myocardial perfusion and viability imaging with PET and high resolution imaging of cardiac structure and function with CMR).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newer magnet technologies allow imaging of the heart at field strengths substantially higher than the more common magnets with field strengths of 1.5 Tesla. Many laboratories are using 3-Tesla magnets to shorten acquisition time and even 4- and 7-Tesla magnets, which are more likely to allow improved phosphorus-31 spectroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. These latter two field strengths are presently used in clinical research laboratories.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GATING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although real time CMR methods (acquisition of an entire image in less than 100 msec) are available and sometimes used, this approach suffers from lower temporal and spatial resolution. Thus, cardiac gating is generally used for CMR since data are typically acquired during many cardiac cycles to optimize spatial resolution. Robust ECG gating generally enables good spin-echo and cine image quality during sinus rhythm and even during atrial fibrillation or in the presence of occasional atrial or ventricular premature beats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although flow velocity encoding imaging can be performed in the presence of atrial fibrillation, image quality may be degraded.</p><p>Although most CMR imaging can be performed during breath holds, longer image acquisitions (eg, for high resolution coronary artery imaging) require respiratory gating in addition to cardiac gating. Respiratory gating can be accomplished using either a navigator approach (to track the motion of the diaphragm) or respiratory bellows (using an elastic band wrapped around the thorax) to monitor respiratory motion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMR has no ionizing effects on patients or caregivers. However, CMR is potentially problematic in patients with ferromagnetic metallic implants. Thorough screening of all patients prior to CMR imaging or spectroscopy is mandatory. Devices such as prosthetic heart valves, prosthetic joints, sternal wires, and intravascular stents do <strong>not</strong> preclude study with CMRI at field strengths of 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla. Issues related to the safety of MRI, including specific recommendations regarding cardiovascular devices (eg, pacemakers), are discussed separately.

It is recommended that gadolinium-based imaging be avoided in such patients. This issue, including the definition of patients at risk, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMR uses high intensity magnetic fields and radiofrequency to generate <span class=\"nowrap\">3D/tomographic</span> images with high spatial resolution and excellent contrast. In 2002, an AHA scientific statement made recommendations for standardized myocardial segmentation and nomenclature used with tomographic imaging of the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55080%7ECARD%2F64968%7ECARD%2F65139\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55080 graphicRef64968 graphicRef65139 \">figure 1A-C</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. CMR has been used for a growing list of applications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The advantages and disadvantages of CMR are summarized in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79652\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79652 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">AORTIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis and assessment of diseases of the aorta is an area in which CMR excels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Spin-echo and cine steady state free precession (SSFP) CMR can precisely define the dimensions and extent of complex aortic aneurysms, false aneurysms, dissection flaps, periaortic abscesses (eg, with endocarditis), aortic arch abnormalities, and coarctation. It can also be used to monitor patients with thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms and patients at risk for developing aortic aneurysms or dissection. In patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, CMR can detect atherosclerotic plaque and supravalvular aortic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>CMR has a major role in the diagnosis, characterization, and determination of the extent of aortic dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69616\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69616 \">image 1</a>). It can provide information about the differential flow velocity in the true and false lumens, and can identify involvement of branch arteries anywhere from coronaries to the femoral arteries. Because of the inherent 3D nature of the technique, the images of the aorta and its pathology can be readily reconstructed into 3D display of the aorta and its branches, thereby facilitating planning for surgical repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemodynamic instability limits the utility of CMR in some patients with aortic dissection. Time of acquisition (in older systems), difficulty with access to the patient, while in the magnet bore, and distortion of the electrocardiogram by the magnetic field make monitoring more difficult. CMR systems optimized for cardiac and vascular imaging can acquire 3D images of the entire thoracic aorta within 25 seconds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PERICARDIAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMR permits direct visualization of the normal pericardium, which is composed of fibrous tissue and has a low CMR signal intensity on spin echo imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The normal pericardium measures less than 3 mm in thickness. Although pericardial fluid also has a low signal intensity, it can be distinguished from pericardium with cine SSFP CMR images on which transudative pericardial fluid has a very bright signal that contrasts with the dark line of the pericardium.</p><p>CMR is the diagnostic procedure of choice for the detection of certain pericardial diseases, such as noncalcified constrictive pericarditis, tumor invasion of the pericardium, and congenital absence of the pericardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. Myocardial tagging techniques can demonstrate tethering of pericardium to the heart during the cardiac cycle. Furthermore, real-time cine imaging allows direct visualization of the effects of respiration on ventricular filling and septal configuration to assist in the diagnosis of pericardial constriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, the presence of pericardial effusion can be established and the distinction made between a hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]; however, echocardiography is generally used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pericardial enhancement seen after administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast agent suggests an inflammatory process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Furthermore, tissue characterization can give important diagnostic information in patients with primary and metastatic cardiac tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36991928\"><span class=\"h1\">MYOCARDIAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMR enables characterization of the range of myocardial diseases from ischemic to inflammatory and various types of cardiomyopathy. It enables visualization and quantification of the size, mass, and global and regional function of the left and right ventricular cavities. Myocardial scar and fibrosis can be identified by gadolinium contrast enhancement techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests to evaluate left ventricular systolic function&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36991943\"><span class=\"h2\">Gadolinium contrast techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36992798\"><span class=\"h3\">Late gadolinium enhancement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is thought to reflect fibrosis and irreversibly damaged myocardium including acute and chronic myocardial infarction (MI).</p><p>The possible role of LGE as a risk predictor for subsequent cardiac events was evaluated in a group of 195 patients without known prior MI, but with known or suspected coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. During an average follow-up of 16 months, patients with LGE on the baseline study had a higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular endpoints (MACE) compared with those without this finding. In addition, LGE was the strongest predictor of MACE taking into account traditional clinical, angiographic, and functional variables.</p><p>The proper role of this diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease remains to be determined.</p><p>If LGE CMR is being considered as a diagnostic option, renal function should be assessed. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Kidney disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36992805\"><span class=\"h4\">Infarct detection and sizing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute and chronic MI can be demonstrated with LGE. This technique may be used to identify the location and extent of infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. Infarct sizing is precise and highly reproducible, with minimal interobserver and intraobserver variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Imaging is typically performed 10 to 20 minutes after intravenous injection of 0.1 to 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">2mmol/kg</span> of gadolinium chelate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A multicenter, double-blinded, randomized trial evaluated the efficacy of infarct detection by LGE in 282 patients with acute MI (up to 16 days post MI) and 284 patients with chronic MI (17 days to 6 months post MI) using varying doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadoversetamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadoversetamide</a> (from 0.05 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Comparing the doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg</span> at 10 minutes after contrast administration, the sensitivity of CMR for detecting MI increased with a dose of gadoversetamide from 84 to 95 to 99 percent for acute MI and from 83 to 87 to 94 percent for chronic MI, respectively. The accuracy for identifying MI location (compared with infarct-related artery perfusion territory) also increased with a dose of contrast agent from 78 to 93 to 99 percent for acute MI and from 80 to 89 to 91 percent for chronic MI for doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg,</span> respectively.</p><p>In a study in both animals and humans, LGE imaging was superior to single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for infarct detection in patients with known or suspected CAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. CMR identified 181 segments with subendocardial MI in 91 patients with known or suspected coronary disease compared with only 96 segments detected by SPECT. SPECT was more comparable to CMR in detecting transmural MI. The superiority of CMR for subendocardial MI detection is likely due to the greater spatial resolution of CMR.</p><p>In a direct comparison of CMR and SPECT in the setting of acute MI, 78 patients who underwent urgent percutaneous coronary intervention were evaluated by both techniques seven days after the infarct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. CMR was significantly more sensitive than SPECT for all infarcts (97 versus 87 percent), small infarcts (92 versus 69 percent), and nonanterior infarcts (98 versus 84 percent) and there was a nonsignificant trend toward increased sensitivity for non-Q wave infarction (85 versus 46 percent).</p><p>CMR may also detect the presence of microvascular obstruction; defined as a central dark area on inversion recovery, CMR images performed one to two minutes (early) after contrast injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. The extent of microvascular obstruction and infarct size increases substantially over the first 48 hours after an MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The clinical significance of CMR-defined microvascular obstruction after an MI has been assessed in small clinical studies. In a report of 44 patients, those with CMR-defined microvascular obstruction had a significantly higher rate of cardiovascular events during a 16-month follow-up (45 versus 9 percent for those without this abnormality) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In addition, LGE in the infarct zone within 24 hours after primary PCI is an independent predictor of impaired left ventricular systolic thickening and remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>In the setting of inferior wall MI, LGE has been compared with physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography for the detection of right ventricular infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In an initial report, LGE CMR was significantly more sensitive than any of the other methods. The clinical and prognostic relevance of this finding remains to be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right ventricular myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36992887\"><span class=\"h4\">Myocardial viability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LGE can also be used to assess myocardial viability (actually nonviability or MI). Studies in laboratory animals have found that, independent of wall motion or infarct age, regions exhibiting gadolinium contrast enhancement at least 10 minutes after the infusion of gadolinium-based contrast agents coincide with regions of myocardial necrosis and irreversible myocardial injury; regions that fail to enhance are viable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>Clinical studies have confirmed that a normal LGE pattern occurs in dysfunctional myocardium that is viable and displays improved contractile function in response to low dose (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min)</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> infusion, while central regions with enhancement where the infarct is transmural display no contractile activity in response to the dobutamine infusion. Territories that have nontransmural necrosis display a diminished contractile response to dobutamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. LGE as a marker of scar closely agrees with the finding of matching defects on PET viability scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-myocardial-viability-by-nuclear-imaging-in-coronary-heart-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of myocardial viability by nuclear imaging in coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Positron emission tomography'</a>.)</p><p>Further support for these findings comes from a clinical study of 32 patients with a proven MI who underwent coronary angiography; LGE, performed 3 or 14 months after the MI, accurately established the presence, location, and transmural extent of healed Q wave and non-Q wave MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Large infarcts were predominantly transmural, while small infarcts were nontransmural (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79527\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79527 \">image 2</a>). The transmural extent of infarction predicts improvement in left ventricular function. In one study of 24 patients, the extent of dysfunctional myocardium that was not infarcted or had necrosis comprising &lt;25 percent of left ventricular wall thickness, as established by LGE performed within one week of the MI, was the best predictor of global improvement in contractility at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>A reduction in the extent of LGE early after an MI is associated with early restoration of blood flow and improvement in contractile function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This is in contrast to what has been seen with microvascular obstruction and early hypoenhancement immediately after an infarction, as discussed above; this myocardium has no contractile response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>LGE CMR can also be used to establish the presence of hibernating myocardium. In one series of 24 patients with stable coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, LGE (three to 15 minutes after contrast administration) was associated with nonviability as established with rest-distribution thallium imaging and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> echocardiography; the absence of enhancement correlated with radionuclide and echocardiographic viability, regardless of the status of resting contractile function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63447\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63447 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

As an example, one study of 50 patients with coronary artery disease who had left ventricular dysfunction prior to surgical or percutaneous revascularization found that 33 percent of myocardial segments in 80 percent of patients had evidence of LGE; 38 percent of segments had abnormal contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. After revascularization, more dysfunctional segments without LGE improved (78 versus 17 percent with enhancement of more than 75 percent of the tissue). The likelihood of improvement in regional contractility after revascularization decreased progressively as the transmural extent of LGE increased.

In the presence of myocardial iron overload, myocardial T2* (T2 star) is reduced due to inhomogeneities that are increased with iron deposition. In one study of 106 patients with thalassemia and multiple blood transfusions, there was a significant inverse correlation between liver T2* and liver iron concentration by biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Increasing myocardial iron content as assessed by myocardial T2* correlated with decreasing left ventricular ejection fraction but there was no correlation between myocardial T2* and serum ferritin or liver iron content, which may relate to temporal differences in iron uptake and release between these two organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>A difference in iron loading and unloading between the liver and heart was also seen in a report dealing with 66 patients (age range: 3 to 82 years) with transfusion-dependent anemias and thalassemia intermedia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. There was a poor correlation between hepatic and myocardial iron as assessed by T2* MRI, and a subgroup of patients was identified with increased myocardial iron without a matched degree of hepatic hemosiderosis. Left ventricular ejection fraction was insensitive for detecting elevated myocardial iron. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload#H404538\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive imaging (MRI)'</a>.)</p><p>Inter-center reproducibility of the T2* technique was validated in a small multicenter study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. CMR also enables evaluation of response to treatment of iron overload. A meta-analysis of available studies in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia has concluded that iron chelators significantly reduced myocardial iron content by approximately 24 percent (95% CI 17-30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. There was no significant difference between the amount of iron reduced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferoxamine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferiprone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferiprone</a>. LVEF was not significantly changed by chelation, although this meta-analysis indicated that a publication bias existed for LVEF, but not for myocardial iron.</p><p>The prognostic value of cardiac T2* was evaluated in a study of 652 thalassemia major patients followed at 21 UK centers who underwent 1442 CMR scans at a single CMR center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].
