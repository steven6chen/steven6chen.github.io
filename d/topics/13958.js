Despite the importance of postpartum perineal care, there is little evidence to guide management; the information in this topic is based largely on our clinical experience. </p><p>In our experience, common postpartum perineal issues include pain control, hygiene, prevention of constipation, and resumption of sexual activity. Clinicians should be able to evaluate less common symptoms, such as severe pain, bulge or mass, or abnormal discharge, including fecal leakage.</p><p>Related topics that are presented separately include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repair of perineal and other lacerations associated with childbirth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed surgical management of the disrupted anal sphincter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of pregnancy and childbirth on anal sphincter function and fecal incontinence&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1591426401\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians often refer to the area between the vagina and anus as the &quot;perineum&quot;; however, anatomically, the perineum is the entirety of the pelvic outlet inferior to the pelvic floor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74060\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74060 \">figure 1</a>). The area between the vagina and anus is more aptly termed &quot;the perineal body.&quot; The anatomy of the perineum is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-female-pelvic-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical female pelvic anatomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-female-urogenital-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical female urogenital anatomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-female-urogenital-anatomy#H26038169\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical female urogenital anatomy&quot;, section on 'Perineum'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1376809788\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We take the following approach to perineal care for all women undergoing vaginal delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2839569635\"><span class=\"h2\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, preliminary education about postpartum care is begun during prenatal visits to help women understand typical changes that will occur during childbirth and recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Once postpartum, we educate each woman about the nature of her perineal laceration or incision (ie, episiotomy), if any, measures for hygiene and comfort, predicted outcomes, and warning signs. We discuss that perineal pain and swelling are common for the first 7 to 10 days, and then typically improve. An individual woman's experience may be faster or slower, depending on clinical circumstances. For example, second-degree obstetric lacerations or episiotomies typically heal by the third postpartum week; women with third- or fourth-degree lacerations may require 4 to 6 weeks. Education and appropriate reassurance, in the absence of concerning symptoms, is important in this period.</p><p>Concerns frequently raised by patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear of suture removal &ndash; Many women understand that they have perineal sutures, which they assume will need to be removed. This anticipated suture removal can cause significant anxiety and distress. We educate women that the sutures are self-absorbing and that no further procedures are typically required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear of bowel movement &ndash; Understandably, many women are afraid that passing a bowel movement will damage the repair, be exquisitely painful, or both. We address this concern with information on pain management and prevention of constipation. (See <a href=\"#H1283923079\" class=\"local\">'Constipation prevention'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear of sexual activity &ndash; Many women are concerned that their vaginal introitus is permanently narrowed or that vaginal intercourse will be difficult or painful after obstetric laceration or episiotomy repair. We discuss that this fear is extremely common and reassure women that despite the initial pain, edema, and bruising they may experience, these changes typically heal well. We educate women that they should be able to resume sexual function by approximately six weeks postpartum (depending on the status of the perineum). Women who are unable to resume predelivery sexual activity by three months postpartum should be evaluated. (See <a href=\"#H1245689639\" class=\"local\">'Resumption of sexual activity'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4052399030\"><span class=\"h2\">Hygiene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following vaginal delivery, a squirt bottle and sitz bath are commonly recommended for perineal care. There are no data to guide sequence or duration of these interventions. We recommend that the woman use the squirt bottle any time she voids for as long as it improves comfort and applies ice to the perineum for 24 hours, with warm water soaks to start thereafter. This approach can be modified based on the woman's feedback; if ice feels better, then we have her to continue with ice packs for an additional 24 hours prior to initiating warm water soaks. In addition, some women find both ice packs and sitz baths helpful and alternate treatments. (See <a href=\"#H415906962\" class=\"local\">'Pain management'</a> below.) </p><p>The squirt bottle is used to irrigate the perineum with warm water during urination, which can help reduce external dysuria, stinging, or discomfort. A sitz bath, a warm shallow bath that bathes the perineum and buttocks, is commonly used to clean the perineum and to reduce pain and swelling, although data are limited. For sitz baths, we recommend each episode be of approximately five minutes duration, for a frequency of four times daily, or after any bowel movement (particularly emphasized in women who have had anal sphincter lacerations). We instruct patients to ensure that the vaginal and rectal areas, including any sutures, are fully placed in the water. Of note, there are conflicting data on the optimal water temperature for pain reduction; women who find cold water more soothing are encouraged to use it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Some clinicians advise adding Epsom salt (one-half cup salt to 1 gallon water) to the bath, although at least one study did not report a difference in perineal pain with its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. We do not routinely recommend this, due to lack of evidence for efficacy. As it does not appear to be harmful, it can be done at provider or patient preference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415906962\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comfort measures include oral analgesics, topical treatments (eg, cold or warm packs), and topical anesthetics. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Topical treatments</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Topical treatments available to reduce perineal pain include ice packs or other cooling agents and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=witch-hazel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">witch hazel</a> pads (ie, hamamelis water). We suggest applying crushed ice to the painful perineal area for 10 to 20 minutes at a time as needed. We recommend using an ice pack or bag of crushed ice and then wrapping it in a cloth such as a hand towel. Direct ice (ice or crushed ice in a plastic bag without wrapping) applied to the skin for longer periods has not been studied and may actually be harmful. In a meta-analysis of 10 trials comparing localized cooling treatments with no treatment or other forms of treatment (eg, gel pads with compression, witch hazel, warm baths), women treated with ice packs reported decreased pain at 24 to 72 hours after birth compared with no treatment (risk ratio 0.61, 95% 0.41-0.91, one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. No impact on healing was reported. In a subsequent trial of 50 women with perineal pain following episiotomy, women treated with crushed ice to the perineum for 20 minutes reported improved pain relief compared with women who received routine care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There was a direct correlation between the temperature reduction in the affected tissue and the pain relief experienced. As an alternate to crushed ice, frozen menstrual pads provide a convenient and lower mess form of cryotherapy. These can be presoaked in water and then frozen to provide longer-lasting cooling. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=witch-hazel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">witch hazel</a> pads are often advised for perineal pain reduction. However, no trials comparing them with placebo are currently available. As they do not appear to be harmful, they can be combined with other treatments as desired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Topical anesthetics</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Benzocaine</a> spray is often offered to patients after vaginal birth to reduce perineal pain, although a meta-analysis of eight trials reported no difference in pain relief with other topical anesthetics (not including benzocaine) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Additional limitations of this meta-analysis included short follow-up and limited assessment of patient satisfaction. One advantage of benzocaine spray is that it does not require touch for application. Some brands also contain skin moisturizers (aloe and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanolin</a>) and menthol, which creates a cooling sensation. We have found this product helpful in reducing perineal discomfort, including the stinging sensation associated with perineal stretching, even if no laceration occurred. Anecdotally, benzocaine spray appears to reduce the discomfort associated with hemorrhoids as well. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral analgesics</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Oral analgesics most commonly used include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>. For women with extensive vaginal or periurethral lacerations, underlying chronic pain syndromes, or obstetrical anal sphincter injuries (OASIS), pain regimens that include short-term opioid analgesia can be required to achieve pain relief. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>NSAIDs are our first choice for perineal pain relief, unless an individual woman has a specific contraindication. In a meta-analysis of 28 trials comparing NSAID (13 different agents) with either placebo or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> for early postpartum perineal pain, adequate pain relief at four hours was nearly twice as likely with NSAID compared with placebo and nearly 50 percent more likely for NSAID compared with acetaminophen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Women treated with an NSAID were also less likely to need additional pain medication at 4 and 6 hours compared with women who received placebo. Maternal adverse effects were minor (eg, dizziness, headache, moderate epigastralgia) and not different from placebo treatment. Neonatal adverse effects were not studied. We suggest oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 600 mg every six hours as needed for pain relief during the first postpartum week. The maximum dose of ibuprofen for women with normal renal function is 2400 mg in 24 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-therapeutic-use-and-variability-of-response-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults&quot;, section on 'Issues in the therapeutic use of NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> is our second-line agent for perineal pain relief based on the above meta-analysis and a different meta-analysis demonstrating improved pain relief with acetaminophen compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. We suggest 650 mg every 6 hours as needed, not to exceed 3250 mg per 24 hours, for pain beyond that controlled with the scheduled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> (ie, we prescribe acetaminophen in addition to the ibuprofen for women who require additional pain relief). While there are no direct comparisons of the dose effect for postpartum perineal discomfort, adequate analgesic effect has been demonstrated with the 500 to 650 mg dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-therapeutic-use-and-variability-of-response-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults&quot;, section on 'Issues in the therapeutic use of NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Additional treatment options for perineal pain include therapeutic ultrasound and plant-based ointments. In a meta-analysis of four trials comparing ultrasound, with or without pulsed electromagnetic therapy, with placebo, there was insufficient evidence to support use of ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a different trial, use of topical <em>Achillea millefolium</em> (ie, arrowroot, yarrow, or yarrow root) or <em>Hypericum perforatum</em> (ie, St. John's wort) ointments were associated with decreased perineal postpartum pain. However, more data are needed on efficacy and safety before routinely prescribing these agents as other proven options are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1283923079\"><span class=\"h2\">Constipation prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constipation during pregnancy and postpartum is common and is believed to result from smooth muscle relaxation caused by progesterone and other hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Postpartum, this effect may continue for days to weeks. Following delivery, we treat women to optimize stool consistency. Maintaining soft bowel movements that can be passed without straining helps avoid pain with defecation, prevent disruption of perineal and rectal sutures (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-gastrointestinal-tract#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Gastrointestinal tract&quot;, section on 'Bowel, rectum, anus'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal treatment is not known. General recommendations for postpartum constipation prevention typically include eating a high-fiber diet and drinking plenty of water, but these may not be adequate in the postpartum setting. Additional treatment options include fiber supplements, stool softeners, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laxatives. A meta-analysis of five trials including 1208 postpartum women compared postpartum laxative use with either placebo or laxative and fiber bulking agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. None of the trials included any educational or behavioral interventions and the only trial that included a stool-bulking agent was focused on women with OASIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Laxative use decreased time to bowel movement and increased frequency of bowel movements, but also increased frequency of diarrhea and fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The four trials comparing laxative to placebo did not assess pain with defecation or straining with bowel movements, but the trial that compared laxative with laxative plus fiber bulking agent reported no difference in pain on defecation. Impact of constipation on surgical repair breakdown rates is not known.</p><p>In discussing constipation prevention with postpartum women, prepregnancy and antenatal bowel habits are reviewed. For example, we inquire about any prior diarrhea-prone irritable bowel symptoms or other gastrointestinal disorders. In the absence of clinical evidence to guide care and in the absence of underlying gastrointestinal disease, we typically treat routine postpartum women with scheduled doses of stool softeners, and then progress through a step-wise treatment plan until the woman is able to pass a soft bowel movement every two to three days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59746\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59746 \">table 1</a>). We allow three days to determine if a treatment is effective or if the next agent in the list needs to be added. We typically advocate continuing the prior medications and adding the next agent in the list, rather than discontinuing the prior agent and moving on to the next. The order of agents is driven in part by the ease of use by the patient. A detailed review of these treatments is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic constipation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults#H30890932\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic constipation in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p>While there are many agents and combinations that can be used to prevent or treat constipation, we prescribe the following drugs, in an additive and stepwise fashion, until constipation is resolved: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docusate</a> sodium (commercial name Colace) 100 mg three times daily.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=senna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">senna</a> 8.6 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">sennosides/tablet</span>.

While women who have not sustained a third- or fourth-degree laceration are candidates for rectal suppositories or enemas if desired, we typically do not recommend them, mainly because they are uncomfortable to use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1245689639\"><span class=\"h2\">Resumption of sexual activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the postpartum resumption of predelivery sexual activity. Generally accepted criteria for resuming predelivery sexual activity include a fully healed perineum, use of contraception, and emotional readiness. We suggest that nothing be placed in the vagina for six weeks; by six weeks postpartum, lochia and vaginal discharge have typically ceased, perineal lacerations have healed, and sutures have resorbed. The postpartum visit typically occurs within the first six weeks and allows evaluation of the perineum and discussion of contraception needs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2784677019\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS REQUIRING EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with any atypical perineal complaint, including severe pain, perineal bulge or mass, abnormal discharge (eg, green vaginal or rectal discharge) should have further evaluation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2465076105\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women reporting severe, persisting, or worsening pain should be evaluated for infection, separation, and hematoma, or other less common complications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3158626647\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extreme or worsening pain, particularly if associated with fever or general malaise, often indicates infection. While perineal infections generally occur during the first week after delivery, women can present with symptoms two or three weeks later. Infection can be limited to the laceration or expand as cellulitis, an abscess, or, in extreme cases, necrotizing fasciitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Infection or an abscess can track into the ischiorectal fossa and present as buttock pain. The obstetric laceration repair can be intact or disrupted by the infection. (See <a href=\"#H2913498372\" class=\"local\">'Separation'</a> below.)</p><p>Women with symptoms concerning for infection should undergo detailed, directed physical examination. Examination findings suggestive of perineal infection include erythema of the surrounding skin, shiny or tense skin, drainage, and edema. We recommend that women with these findings undergo perineal exploration, possible debridement, and possible abscess drainage. We attempt to do as much as possible in the outpatient office setting to minimize disruption to mother-infant bonding. However, women with extreme pain may benefit from performing the examination with sedation or anesthesia (regional or general) as indicated. </p><p>Once perineal infection is identified, we take the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there are signs of abscess or a soft-tissue infection, we initiate systemic oral antibiotics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-in-adults-treatment#H1936863535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Clinical approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an abscess is identified, we open the repair and drain the abscess. In an office setting, opening and drainage are preceded by adequate local anesthesia (topical or injectable). Following removal of a portion of the sutures, the abscess cavity should be thoroughly irrigated. Some women with a bulging abscess may tolerate having the sutures cut and the abscess drained without local anesthesia because abscess drainage releases the pressure that was causing the pain. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the infection appears to be in the deeper portion of a repair, an incision into the surrounding tissues, drainage, tissue debridement, and packing can be indicated. For small abscesses, this can either be performed in the office or in the operating room. For larger abscesses or if there are any concerns about the <span class=\"nowrap\">depth/extent</span> of infection, we prefer to incise and drain the repair in an operating room where appropriate <span class=\"nowrap\">analgesia/anesthesia</span> options and instruments are available and adequate exploration can be achieved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who appear systemically ill and have evidence of deep tissue infection, we evaluate them for necrotizing deep tissue infections. If there is a significant concern for possible necrotizing infection and imaging is not rapidly available, proceeding directing to the operating room for surgical exploration is the prudent and recommended course of action, as a delay in treatment of this rare but life-threatening complication can be catastrophic for the patient. If imaging can be done expeditiously, we find that images can provide additional information regarding the extent of tissue involvement, help identify the amount of debridement that may be necessary, and indicate the potential need for additional surgical assistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2913498372\"><span class=\"h3\">Separation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Separation of a repaired perineal laceration or episiotomy, also described as breakdown or dehiscence, refers to the disruption of a sutured repair. The separation can be partial or complete. Although separation can occur in the absence of infection, infection is more commonly present. Studies suggest the peak time of separation is approximately 10 to 14 days following vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Women at highest risk of a separation are those who have sustained a third- or fourth-degree laceration. Women with separation typically present with increased pain or burning, abnormal discharge, or, less commonly, after experiencing a &quot;popping&quot; sensation. </p><p>For women with separation and infection, the repair is further opened and the patient is managed as described above until the infection has resolved (see <a href=\"#H3158626647\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above). For women with separation but no infection, we take the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with separation of first- or second-degree lacerations can be managed expectantly, to heal by secondary intention, or have the open laceration repaired. In a meta-analysis of two trials totaling 52 women that compared secondary suturing with non-suturing, there was no difference in healing at four weeks or dyspareunia rates at two and six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although more women in the suturing group had resumed intercourse by 2 months, there was no difference at six months. No data on pain or patient satisfaction were reported. In our clinical experience, most women with first- or second-degree perineal injuries do well with expectant management. As limited available data suggest equal outcomes, we discuss the risks and benefits of each and ask for the woman's preference in choosing the management plan. Some women prefer to heal by secondary intention because this approach avoids the stress of surgical debridement and secondary repair. Other women prefer to have the laceration closed directly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repair of perineal and other lacerations associated with childbirth&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repair of perineal and other lacerations associated with childbirth&quot;, section on 'Secondary repair of episiotomy breakdown'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with separation of third- or fourth-degree laceration repairs are typically treated with antibiotics, undergo operative tissue debridement until healthy tissue is present, and then receive a secondary repair. We believe this approach minimizes the risk of fistula formation and increases the likelihood of a successful repair, although supporting data are limited, particularly around choice of antibiotics. We typically use a first-generation cephalosporin unless there is evidence that more broad coverage is required (eg, fecal contamination of laceration). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repair of perineal and other lacerations associated with childbirth&quot;, section on 'Secondary repair of episiotomy breakdown'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Aseptic technique during the initial repair is key to prevent subsequent separation. In one trial, application of povidone-iodine powder to the perineum during episiotomy repair was associated with decreased incidence of separation in the treated group compared with the standard care group (separation rates 3.5 versus 13.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although the body of evidence is limited, the 2007 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines as well as the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend using aseptic techniques during perineal repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Unless a contraindication exists, we routinely use liquid betadine and saline irrigation to cleanse the perineum prior to suturing. In the event of an allergy to betadine, we recommend use of baby shampoo mixed with water or saline irrigation. Repair of obstetric lacerations or episiotomy is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repair of perineal and other lacerations associated with childbirth&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Granulation tissue often appears pink or reddened, with a tissue overgrowth or papillary appearance; granulation tissue can develop in the area of perineal repair, which should not be confused with an infection or breakdown. Expectant observation is generally sufficient, unless the granulation tissue is painful, bleeding, or otherwise bothersome to the woman. We treat symptomatic granulation tissues with either application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a> (small areas) or simple excision in the office. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2035453457\"><span class=\"h2\">Bulge or mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common causes of abnormal bulges or tissue in postpartum women include hemorrhoids (including thrombosed or prolapsed hemorrhoids), hematomas, and uterovaginal prolapse, in particular anterior wall bulge. The diagnosis of each is made during physical examination. Briefly, hemorrhoids appear as purplish masses protruding from the anus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78700\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78700 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72916 \">picture 2</a>). Hemorrhoids are typically treated with conservative management, but thrombosed hemorrhoids can require incision and drainage. In uterovaginal prolapse, the cervix or vaginal wall is visualized in the lower half of the vaginal canal or protruding out of the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64451\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64451 \">picture 3</a>). </p><p>Women with prolapse can be fit with a pessary to provide support and reduce any associated pelvic ache or burning. Such prolapse will usually improve as they recover from the delivery, although they may be at higher likelihood of later development of pelvic floor laxity.</p><p>Presenting symptoms, diagnosis, and management of these entities is discussed in detail in the following topics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home and office treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hematomas-incurred-as-a-result-of-obstetrical-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hematomas incurred as a result of obstetrical delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3928907578\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postpartum hematomas, particularly of the vagina and vulva, can expand rapidly and be exquisitely painful. These typically occur within 24 hours of delivery. Women commonly note rapid development of a severely painful bulge in the vagina, vulva, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perineum. Physical examination confirms a vulvar or perineal bulge covered by skin with underlying purplish discoloration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

For comparison, normal postpartum vaginal discharge (ie, lochia) can last for up to eight weeks, typically changes from <span class=\"nowrap\">red/brown</span> to a watery yellow-white, and gradually decreases in volume. We educate women about normal discharge and recommend further evaluation if they experience abnormal discharge. While these somewhat vague descriptions may result in the evaluation of women who are healing appropriately, we believe fewer women with complications are missed with this approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care#H629529854\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the postpartum period: Physiology, complications, and maternal care&quot;, section on 'Lochia'</a>.)</p><p>Causes of abnormal discharge include a retained sponge, draining abscess, fistula, or incontinence. While women with a perineal abscess tend to present with perineal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever within the first week following delivery, a draining abscess can be perceived as abnormal discharge. Both vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistula can present days to months following delivery. Any woman with a sudden increase in urine loss, constant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> brown discharge, or vaginal discharge only when she also has diarrhea should prompt evaluation. Stress urinary incontinence postpartum typically presents within the first few days following delivery and generally slowly improves. Fecal incontinence from a sphincter laceration or an undiagnosed button-hole injury in the mucosa above the sphincter may present immediately or following the first episode of soft stool. </p><p>Presenting symptoms, diagnosis, and management of these entities is discussed in detail in the following topics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perianal-and-perirectal-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perianal and perirectal abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectovaginal-and-anovaginal-fistulas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectovaginal and anovaginal fistulas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H159435472\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women suspected of having a perineal complication require a pelvic examination, despite concomitant pain, tissue edema, and patient anxiety. A discussion of the components of the pelvic examination is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gynecologic history and pelvic examination&quot;, section on 'Pelvic examination'</a>.)</p><p>Generally we perform the initial evaluation in the office. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> jelly can be applied to the perineum to reduce examination-related discomfort. Superficial inspection of the labia and perineum can identify erythema suggestive of infection, a distal abscess, or superficial cellulitis. For women with symptoms or examination findings concerning for abscess, hematoma, or separation, digital vaginal examination is performed with a single examination finger to minimize patient discomfort. If a speculum examination is indicated, we use the smallest speculum that provides adequate visualization and separate the speculum to use only the posterior blade to retract the obstructing tissue. </p><p>If the woman is unable to tolerate the examination, we proceed with an examination under anesthesia. While such an examination is typically performed in an operating room, some labor and delivery units have the ability to provide intravenous conscious sedation outside of the operating room. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1043415067\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-DISCHARGE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal post-discharge care of women with first- or second-degree perineal lacerations or episiotomy is not known; we typically see these women at six weeks postpartum. In the interim, patients are instructed to report concerning symptoms, specifically vaginal discharge that appears purulent, fevers, or increasing pain in the perineum.</p><p>We advise more frequent follow-up for women with<sup> </sup>third-<sup> </sup>or fourth-degree obstetric lacerations to ensure early detection of any developing complications. We generally schedule these women for an outpatient visit and examination one to two weeks following hospital discharge and then continue to see them every one to two weeks until the repair has completely healed. Women who may benefit from weekly visits include those with medical risk factors for poor wound healing (eg, women with diabetes, immunosuppression, other comorbidities, or smokers), women with extensive repairs, and women who find perineal care challenging (eg, limited social support or intellectual capabilities). For women who are unable to visit weekly, an alternate option can be evaluation by a visiting nurse or similar service.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3220776891\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3784669247\"><span class=\"h2\">Perineal pain or dyspareunia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolonged postpartum perineal pain and dyspareunia are relatively common. In a questionnaire study, 8 percent of women reported persistent perineal pain at one year following vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a retrospective study comparing the degree of obstetric perineal laceration and sexual function in primiparous women, approximately 20 percent reported dyspareunia at six months after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Episiotomy did not increase the risk of postpartum dyspareunia relative to same degree of spontaneous laceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Factors associated with increased risk of postpartum dyspareunia include operative vaginal delivery (both forceps and vacuum) and third- and fourth-degree obstetric lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. Women with persistent perineal pain or dyspareunia at three months postpartum can benefit from pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT) for symptom reduction, although the data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. We do not universally request early referrals for PFMT in postpartum women to reduce the likelihood of development of postpartum pain or dyspareunia. If these symptoms are reported following their six-week postpartum visit, we will offer a referral for PFMT at that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. </p><p>For women with refractory perineal pain or dyspareunia who have not responded to PFMT, revision perineoplasty is a treatment option. In a study of nine women with persistent perineal dyspareunia and anatomic distortion (ie, scarring), there was a significant reduction in perineal pain and increase in coital frequency and satisfaction following perineal revision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, as repeat surgery can also increase scarring and resultant pain, revision perineoplasty is reserved for women with persistent, severe symptoms that are isolated to the obstetric scar.</p><p>While transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and therapeutic ultrasound therapy have been used to treat postpartum perineal pain and dyspareunia, we do not prescribe them as the body of evidence is limited. One small trial of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy reported decreased dyspareunia with treatment, but no control group was included for comparison [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a meta-analysis of four trials comparing therapeutic ultrasound with placebo, women in two trials were more likely to report perineal pain reduction with treatment and women in one trial were less likely to report dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, because no other measured outcomes reached significance and the overall quality of the trials was variable, the authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess therapeutic ultrasound as a treatment for postpartum perineal pain or dyspareunia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2072775406\"><span class=\"h2\">Incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the available data are limited, we suggest postpartum PFMT for women with incontinence (urinary or anal) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic organ prolapse that remains symptomatic three months after delivery. PFMT appears to improve postpartum urinary and anal incontinence symptoms at 1 year, but not in the long-term (6 to 12 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postpartum-perineal-care-and-management-of-complications/abstract/27,28,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,32</a>].
