SUDEP is defined specifically as the sudden, unexpected, witnessed or unwitnessed, nontraumatic and nondrowning death in patients with epilepsy with or without evidence of a seizure, and excluding documented status epilepticus, in which post mortem examination does not reveal a structural or toxicologic cause for death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The cause of SUDEP is uncertain. Observations in individual cases have suggested possible cardiogenic, pulmonary, and primary neurologic etiologies. It may be that SUDEP is a heterogeneous condition. The vast majority of witnessed cases have been associated with a seizure, and the main risk factor is uncontrolled seizures, especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures.</p><p>This topic discusses risk factors, causes, and prevention strategies for SUDEP. The management and other complications of seizures and epilepsy are discussed separately.

Near SUDEP describes cases in which cardiorespiratory arrest was reversed by resuscitation efforts with subsequent survival for more than one hour.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) causes between 2 and 18 percent of all deaths in patients with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. This proportion may be somewhat higher in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis by the American Academy of Neurology identified 12 studies on the incidence of SUDEP of low to moderate quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Based on these studies, the overall incidence of SUDEP was estimated at 0.58 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 0.31-1.08). The incidence was lower in children (0.22 per 1000 person-years, 95% 0.16-0.31) and higher in adults (1.2 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 0.64-2.32). A subsequently published Swedish population-based study that included more than 57,000 people with epilepsy found a higher overall incidence (1.2 per 1000 person-years) and a higher incidence in children (1.11 per 1000 person-years) than previously reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The authors noted that only two-thirds of probable and possible SUDEP cases had epilepsy listed on the death certificate, suggesting that studies using death certificates for case ascertainment may underestimate incidence. A separate study came to similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The incidence of SUDEP increases with severity of epilepsy, and may be as high as 0.5 to 1 percent a year in those with severe refractory epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. In adult epilepsy monitoring units, the incidence of SUDEP has been estimated at 5 per 1000 epilepsy patient-years, with a risk of 1.2 cases per 10,000 video electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The lifetime cumulative risk for SUDEP by age 40 has been estimated at 7 percent overall, or 12 percent in those with persistent epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The cumulative full lifetime risk has been estimated to be 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4061626\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3845109715\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizure type and frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the presence and frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures have a 10-fold higher risk of SUDEP compared with those who do not have generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and those with three or more generalized tonic-clonic seizures per year have a 15-fold increased risk of SUDEP compared with those who have fewer than three per year. This translates to an absolute risk of up to 18 deaths per 1,000 person-years in patients with frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1586490398\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most reported cases of SUDEP are in young adults between the ages of 18 and 40 years, but children younger than one year can be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/6,8,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,16-18</a>]. The incidence of SUDEP may be up to five times higher in adults compared with children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p>SUDEP is relatively unusual in individuals greater than 45 years. However, the latter observation may be due to under-reporting of sudden death as SUDEP in an older individual, particularly if there are medical comorbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4279106662\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A genetic predisposition to SUDEP has long been entertained based on the observation that genetic mutations in ion channels underlie some forms of epilepsy as well as syndromes associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death, such as the congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Some cases of SUDEP may in fact be caused by LQTS. This was suggested by a study of 61 SUDEP cases for which whole blood was collected at autopsy and later analyzed by exome sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Pathogenic mutations in LQTS genes were identified in four patients (7 percent), and an additional nine patients (15 percent) had candidate pathogenic variants in dominant cardiac arrhythmia genes. None of the SUDEP cases had a history of cardiac disease. Electrocardiograms (ECG) were available in six of the patients with pathogenic or candidate LQTS variants; all showed normal sinus rhythm, five had a normal corrected QT interval, and one had a borderline corrected QT. These findings need to be confirmed in other studies and validated prospectively to determine whether there is a role for genetic testing in epilepsy patients. Review of a routine ECG is important in the initial evaluation of all patients with epilepsy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Counseling and prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>This study also found a relatively high frequency of <em>DEPDC5</em> mutations in SUDEP cases, although this may merely reflect that <em>DEPDC5</em> is a common cause of focal epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Genetic focal epilepsy syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>Mutations in sodium channel genes (eg, <em>SCN1A</em>, <em>SCN1B</em>, <em>SCN2A</em>) were identified in several patients with epileptic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other studies have also suggested that patients with Dravet syndrome (DS), caused in many cases by <em>SCN1A</em> mutations, may have cardiac alterations that put them at increased risk for SUDEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

This was based on the finding that prone positioning at the time of death was reported in 73 percent of SUDEP cases in which body position was adequately documented. However, only a small number of published SUDEP studies were included in the analysis (25 out of 1106), since most articles did not include information about sleep positioning. Additional studies are needed to understand whether sleep position might be a modifiable risk factor for SUDEP, as is the case in sudden infant death syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is only rarely witnessed, most observations suggest that SUDEP usually occurs in the context of a seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/2,4,18,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,18,29</a>]. Cases of witnessed sudden cardiac arrest meeting criteria for SUDEP and without a preceding seizure have been described, however, including several cases in which electroencephalogram (EEG) excluded subclinical seizure activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Many SUDEP deaths occur at night while the patient is asleep in bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/4,8,16,18,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,16,18,32</a>].</p><p>No singular mechanism has been established, and multiple pathophysiologic factors may be involved, including cardiac arrhythmia, seizure-induced respiratory changes and pulmonary dysfunction, and neurogenic cardiorespiratory depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/2,8,29,33-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,29,33-39</a>]. Genetic factors may also play a role in predisposing patients to SUDEP. (See <a href=\"#H4279106662\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiogenic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indirect evidence suggests that cardiogenic mechanisms, including cardiac arrhythmias and cardiovascular disease, may be involved in some cases of SUDEP. In one prospective population-based cohort study of more than 2000 cases of sudden cardiac arrest, 4.4 percent of patients had a history of epilepsy and among these patients, two-thirds of witnessed arrests were not preceded by clinical seizure activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4272476155\"><span class=\"h3\">Ictal bradycardia and asystole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ictal bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and even asystole can be observed in some patients with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-45</a>], raising the possibility that some cases of SUDEP are explained by this phenomenon. However, the relationship between ictal heart rate changes and SUDEP is not firmly established, and it is not known whether patients with ictal bradycardia or asystole have an increased risk of SUDEP compared with those who do not have these features.</p><p>The frequency of bradycardia and asystole in patients with epilepsy is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In one series that reviewed long-term EEG monitoring data on 1277 seizures in 69 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, rates of ictal bradycardia and asystole were 7 and 2.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; in a series of 6825 patients on long-term monitoring, the rate of ictal asystole was only 0.15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Although classically considered to be associated with left temporal seizures in patients with longstanding epilepsy, ictal asystole can also occur early in the course of epilepsy and can be caused by right temporal as well as frontal and insular seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Both ictal bradycardia and asystole are unusual in children. In one case series of 49 children who had seizures on a monitoring study, ictal bradycardia occurred in 3.7 percent of seizures and only during partial complex seizures of extratemporal onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Monitoring studies have identified clinical features that suggest an ictal arrhythmia. Diffuse atonia has been observed to accompany episodes of asystole lasting longer than eight seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In three patients with focal epilepsy, sudden falls occurred due to seizure-induced asystole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These observations suggest that when seizures include a delayed loss of tone, clinicians should consider the possibility of ictal asystole and need for cardiac monitoring. The recurrence risk of ictal asystole may be as high as 30 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Pacemaker implantation appears to reduce falls and secondary morbidity in patients with seizure-induced asystole and bradycardia when seizures are not controlled by other therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>At least one investigation observed that the cardiovascular characteristics of ictal asystole were similar to tilt-table induced vasovagal asystole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The authors speculated that ictal asystole might share a pathophysiologic mechanism with vasovagal syncope and perhaps be similarly benign.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3131803739\"><span class=\"h3\">Prolonged QT interval and tachyarrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizure-induced changes in the QT interval or autonomic instability, predisposing to malignant arrhythmias, have also been proposed as possible mechanisms in SUDEP. Support for this mechanism is bolstered by the finding that some patients with SUDEP carry a pathogenic mutation in one of the genes associated with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). (See <a href=\"#H4279106662\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Seizure-induced changes in the QT interval have been described, although their significance is not clear. A number of case series of combined EEG-ECG telemetry have noted prolongation of the QT interval during seizures in 12 to 23 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-57</a>]. This finding may be associated with potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias. However, in a matched case-control study, a prolonged QT interval was not specifically associated with SUDEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>A pre-ictal shortened QT interval has also been observed but is of uncertain clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Other electrocardiogram (ECG) markers for cardiovascular arrhythmia and mortality (T-wave alternans, ventricular late potentials) have also been found to be more prevalent in patients with epilepsy compared with controls in small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>Direct evidence of mortality from seizure-induced cardiac arrhythmias is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], and the etiologic link between seizures and cardiac arrhythmias and possibly sudden cardiac death remains to be established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. In one study of 21 patients with SUDEP, a prior EEG-ECG recording had revealed ictal cardiac repolarization and rhythm abnormalities in 56 percent of SUDEP patients compared with 39 percent of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. SUDEP patients also had higher ictal heart rate elevations, particularly in seizures that arose from sleep. However, these data do not indicate that routine ECG recording or ambulatory ECG monitoring can identify which epilepsy patients are at increased risk for SUDEP.</p><p>Some authors have suggested that release of catecholamines during seizures may lead to cumulative cardiac injury (takotsubo cardiomyopathy) and possibly a susceptibility to arrhythmia or sudden hemodynamic compromise and cardiogenic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>The influence of antiseizure drug treatment on SUDEP is another potential factor. Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> have been implicated as possibly exacerbating some of the autonomic and cardiac effects of seizures, but an increased risk of either ictal arrhythmias or SUDEP with these or other antiseizure drugs has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lamotrigine</a> has been identified in some reports as increasing the risk of SUDEP in women with primary generalized epilepsy, possibly through a proarrhythmic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy/abstract/23,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,64</a>].

Cardiorespiratory and EEG data available from 10 cases showed a consistent and previously unrecognized pattern whereby a triggering secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure was followed by a short period of normal or increased heart and respiratory rates, after which a combination of central apnea, severe bradycardia, and transient or terminal asystole occurred together with postictal generalized EEG attenuation.
