Depending in part upon the site and extent of cardiac hypertrophy, patients with HCM can develop one or more of the following abnormalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LV outflow obstruction </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diastolic dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial ischemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral regurgitation</p><p/><p>These structural and functional abnormalities can produce a variety of symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presyncope or syncope</p><p/><p>In broad terms, the symptoms related to HCM can be categorized as those related to heart failure (HF), chest pain, or arrhythmias. Patients with HCM have an increased incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. A very small subgroup of predominantly younger HCM patients is at an increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-pathophysiology-and-management-of-concurrent-atrial-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of concurrent atrial arrhythmias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Assessment and management of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Phenotypic development with LVH typically begins in puberty, and usually by early adulthood, increases in wall thickness are complete with little change over time. For the majority of patients with HCM, clinical course is relatively benign. However, a subset of patients with LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction will develop progressive heart failure symptoms requiring invasive septal reduction therapy for relief of outflow gradients, while an even smaller number of patients without LVOT obstruction will progress to an end-stage form of the disease that is characterized by LV dilation and wall thinning and systolic dysfunction. Such patients are managed according to the standard approach to patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction.

LVH and other aspects of HCM phenotypic expression are secondary to consequences of sarcomere dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-gene-mutations-and-clinical-genetic-testing/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, given the availability of genetic testing, a greater number of HCM family members are now being identified as carrying a disease-causing mutation in the absence of LVH (ie, genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/phenotype</span> negative). </p><p>The genetics of HCM will be reviewed here, including a discussion of the role of genetic testing and screening.

A number of institutional and commercial laboratories offer comprehensive genetic testing on a fee-for-service basis with panels that incorporate the most common mutations responsible for HCM. The development of DNA-based testing of patients with HCM can aid in diagnosis and management of patients, and permit cascade screening of families. However, genetic testing for HCM is not as straightforward as it might at first appear, as a number of issues, particularly related to the interpretation of findings, limit the usefulness of this test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-gene-mutations-and-clinical-genetic-testing/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Some mutations appear to enhance contractility, while others have the opposite effect. (See <a href=\"#H22623661\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in the cardiac myosin binding protein C gene and cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F90769\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90769 \">figure 2</a>) are the two most common mutations responsible for close to 70 percent of identifiable mutations in HCM. Mutations in the troponin I, troponin T, and alpha-tropomyosin genes account for only 5 to 10 percent of cases, while up to 5 percent of HCM patients have multiple mutations. (See <a href=\"#H112767698\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of identified mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing for HCM is available as a clinical test. Genetic testing is limited by the fact that only 50 percent of patients have an identifiable mutation, and a substantial proportion have variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in which the pathogenicity of the mutation is uncertain. The greatest clinical applicability of genetic testing is in identifying at risk family members. However, prior to performing genetic testing in a family, first-degree relatives of an affected individual should be evaluated (by history, physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography) for clinical evidence of HCM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F90767\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef90767 \">algorithm 1</a>). If a disease-causing mutation is identified in the proband, then other family members who have no clinical evidence of disease by echocardiography can be tested for that specific mutation to determine if they are at risk or not of developing HCM. (See <a href=\"#H112767979\" class=\"local\">'Screening of family members for HCM'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Screening of first-degree relatives'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The availability of genetic testing in the clinical care of patients has resulted in the identification of a growing number of genotype <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/phenotype</span> negative (G+ P-) patients. Although penetrance of sarcomere mutation is considered high, the precise likelihood of developing disease with a mutation is uncertain. There is no compelling evidence that G+ P- are at increased risk of sudden death, and therefore current recommendations do not definitively exclude G+ P- patients from participating in competitive sports. However, for G+ P- family members it is prudent to extend standard HCM surveillance with cardiac imaging at least through mid-life (40 years of age) to detect development of the phenotype. (See <a href=\"#H112767993\" class=\"local\">'Genotype-phenotype relationships'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no clear relationship between genotype and phenotype in HCM. Therefore it is not possible to predict the type or extent of morphologic expression in an individual patient based on mutation. In addition, it is not possible to predict clinical outcome based on individual mutations, and therefore results of genetic testing do not impact on patient management strategies, including decision-making for ICD therapy. One possible exception to the principle that mutations do not predict clinical outcome relates to patients with double (or triple) mutations. Emerging observations suggest HCM patients with more than one disease-causing mutation are at greater risk of adverse disease related events, although more data are necessary before predicating management decisions based on the presence of multiple mutations.
