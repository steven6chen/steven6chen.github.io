The two main <em>Borrelia </em>spp involved in North America are <em>Borrelia hermsii</em> (in the mountainous West) and <em>Borrelia turicatae</em> (in the Southwest and South Central region), although rare cases of human infection with <em>Borrelia parkeri</em> have also been reported in the United States.

For fixed blood smears, the spirochetes are detected by Wright or Giemsa stain. Borrelias have fewer and larger amplitude waves than the tightly-coiled treponemes and leptospires.

These lipoproteins are anchored by fatty acids at their amino-terminal ends, which are embedded in the fluid membrane of the spirochetes.</p><p>A feature of <em>Borrelia</em> that distinguishes the genus from other spirochetes and most other bacteria is a largely linear genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Each genome consists of a linear chromosome of about 1000 kilobases and one copy each of different types of linear and circular plasmids.</p><p>The relapsing fever group of <em>Borrelia </em>spp possess several biosynthetic genes that were acquired by horizontal transfer from other types of bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. These include genes for enzymes in salvage and synthesis pathways for nucleotides. These genes may explain why <em>Borrelia</em> of the relapsing fever group proliferate to higher numbers in host cells compared with the spirochetes that cause Lyme disease. Another gene unique to the relapsing fever group is glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, or GlpQ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. GlpQ is immunogenic and serves as the basis for a subunit recombinant immunoassay that serologically discriminates relapsing fever from Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H302821251\"><span class=\"h2\">Variable major proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antigens that determine serotype identity of relapsing fever <em>Borrelia </em>spp are abundant outer membrane lipoproteins called variable major proteins (VMPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In <em>B. hermsii</em>, for example, there are approximately 30 different VMPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. There can be as little as 30 percent identity in amino acid sequences between two different VMPs of the same strain of a relapsing fever <em>Borrelia </em>spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Only one VMP gene is expressed at a time in a cell. Expression of this gene occurs at a site near the end of a linear plasmid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. The other 30 or so VMP genes in the genome are also located on linear plasmids, often tandemly arrayed, but they are silent (ie, not expressed in this storage or archival form) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The expression site, unlike the silent sites, has a promoter adjacent to the 5' end of the VMP gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>During expansion of the population, a different VMP gene replaces the one at the expression site at a frequency of approximately 10<sup>-4</sup> per cell generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31</a>]. In other words, by the time the population size in an infection reaches around 10,000 organisms, a new serotype has probably appeared. The new serotype is still infrequent at the time the host responds to the infecting serotype with an outpouring of IgM antibodies. But the new serotype continues to proliferate while the original infecting serotype is cleared from the blood. Once the second serotype reaches a population size of 10,000 or so organisms in the animal, another one or two serotypes have spontaneously appeared. The antibodies do not cause the change in serotype; they merely select against the majority of cells in the population, allowing new serotypes to predominate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3570662876\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of gene replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In <em>B. hermsii</em>, there are two ways in which a VMP gene at the expression site is replaced by another VMP gene, thereby switching the serotype of the organism. The first and most common mechanism is recombination between two linear plasmids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/25,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28,29</a>]. A simplified representation of such a switch in VMP genes is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66891\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66891 \">figure 1</a>). The boundaries for this recombination are regions of sequence identity between silent and expression sites around and flanking the 5' and 3' ends of the expressed and silent VMP genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/25,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,31</a>]. </p><p>The second mechanism by which a new VMP gene is expressed is an intramolecular recombination between two tandemly arrayed VMP genes on the same plasmid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A deletion between short direct repeats at the 5' ends of each of the two genes effectively excises the sitting VMP gene. The one behind moves up with deletion to take its place next to the promoter. After this deletion, the newly expressed VMP gene is susceptible to further small gene conversions that provide further diversity of the VMP gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p><em>B. hermsii</em> also has another type of VMP, known as the Variable Tick Protein (Vtp); its expression is specifically associated with the tick stage of its life cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The Vtp gene with its own promoter is located on a different plasmid from those with other VMP genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/30,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,36</a>]. Sequences of Vtp genes differ between strains and are used to genotype <em>B. hermsii</em> strains for epidemiologic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2412731579\"><span class=\"h2\">Cultivation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Borrelias are microaerophilic microorganisms with complex nutritional requirements for growth in cell-free medium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The medium contains serum, glucose, albumin, peptides, amino acids, vitamins, a thickening agent such as gelatin, and, critically, N-acetylglucosamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

In the mountainous western United States, the onset of TBRF is most frequent during the summer, while in the Southwest, more cases occur in the late fall or winter. In a survey of 504 cases in the US from 1990 to 2011, TBRF was more common in males (57 percent), and there were peaks in the incidence among persons aged 10 to 14 and 40 to 44 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The <em>Borrelia</em> sp that causes TBRF can vary depending upon the geographic location.

By changing a major antigen on its surface, the <em>Borrelia</em> population is able to stay one step ahead of the host adaptive immune response. Other vector-borne pathogens that use the strategy of multiphasic antigenic variation as a strategy to evade specific immunity are trypanosomes that cause African trypanosomiasis and <em>Plasmodium</em> species that cause malaria.
