Histoplasmosis and its causative agent, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, are found worldwide but particularly in North and Central America. Within the United States, infection is most common in the midwestern states located in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. Among the endemic mycoses, it is the most common cause for hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Histoplasmosis is major cause of opportunistic infection in several Latin American countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], including patients without AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Disseminated histoplasmosis is a progressive extrapulmonary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Hematogenous dissemination probably occurs in most patients during the acute infection before cellular immunity develops. Disseminated disease occurs in approximately 1 in 2000 patients with acute infection. Most patients who develop disseminated histoplasmosis are immunosuppressed (eg, AIDS, solid organ transplantation, treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors) or are at the extremes of age. In addition, chronic progressive disseminated histoplasmosis occurs uncommonly in older adults with no known immunosuppressing conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis requires a high index of suspicion, recognition of the common modes of presentation, and familiarity with the appropriate diagnostic tests. Treatment is highly effective but relapse can occur in severely immunocompromised individuals.</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of disseminated histoplasmosis will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, risk factors for dissemination, and clinical manifestations of this infection and the diagnosis and treatment of localized pulmonary histoplasmosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of disseminated histoplasmosis are fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Symptoms and signs may point to involvement of specific sites, such as the skin, oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, and adrenal glands. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis in such patients includes malignancy, infection (eg, tuberculosis, other fungal diseases), or inflammatory disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis). Misdiagnosis of an inflammatory process may lead to inappropriate and harmful therapy with glucocorticoids, cytotoxic agents, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;, section on 'Distinction from sarcoidosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE FOR DISSEMINATED DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunosuppression is a strong risk factor for dissemination in patients with histoplasmosis. Microscopic demonstration or isolation of <em>Histoplasma</em> from extrapulmonary sites provides proof of dissemination in patients with histoplasmosis. A variety of clinical, radiographic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory abnormalities may give a clue as to the sites of involvement in disseminated histoplasmosis, as noted below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, skin lesions, mucosal lesions, altered mental status, or neurologic abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, suggesting bone marrow or spleen involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57613 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevations in serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bilirubin, suggesting hepatic involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Markedly elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin values.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial or reticulonodular infiltrates &ndash; Chest radiographs are abnormal in 70 percent of patients, usually showing diffuse interstitial or reticulonodular infiltrates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53565\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53565 \">image 1</a>); mediastinal adenopathy occurs in about 20 percent and cavitation is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

While diffuse infiltrates are also seen in patients with acute histoplasmosis following a large inoculum exposure, in the absence of such an exposure history, and especially in an immunosuppressed patient, diffuse reticulonodular or miliary infiltrates suggest disseminated disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid findings of lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single or multiple enhancing brain lesions on computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) &ndash; These can be seen in approximately one-third of patients with central nervous system histoplasmosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70552\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70552 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal CT scan showing enlargement of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, or lymph nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions in the stomach, small intestines, or colon found on gastrointestinal endoscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF HISTOPLASMOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histopathology using stains for fungi, cultures, antigen detection, and serologic tests for <em>Histoplasma</em>-specific antibodies can all help make the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis. Rapid diagnosis is often achieved by antigen determination; cytologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histopathologic examination of tissue samples, respiratory secretions, or body fluids; or Wright&rsquo;s stain of blood smears (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57613 \">picture 1</a>). Serologic tests for antibody to <em>H. capsulatum</em> and culture of the organism are less rapid methods but can aid in confirming the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigen testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests for antigen in urine and serum should be performed in all patients suspected of having disseminated histoplasmosis in order to achieve the highest sensitivity. Reports from the laboratory that established the enzyme immunoassay showed that <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen can be detected in the urine of approximately 75 percent of nonimmunocompromised and 95 percent of immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Antigen can be detected in the serum of close to 100 percent of cases, including some cases in which results in urine were negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. However, large prospective studies that have included a broad spectrum of hosts and diverse manifestations have not been performed. Thus, it should be noted that a negative antigen test does not rule out disseminated histoplasmosis. Antigen can also be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in most patients with central nervous involvement. Respiratory specimens obtained via bronchoscopy tested positive for antigen in 90 percent of patients with pulmonary involvement in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other tests have been developed using different antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. <strong>Please note that one of the authors (LJW) is owner and Director of MiraVista Diagnostics, a reference laboratory that performs </strong><strong><em>Histoplasma</em></strong><strong> antigen testing.</strong></p><p>False-positive results occur in most patients with blastomycosis and less frequently with coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and penicilliosis (<em>Talaromyces</em> <em>marneffei</em> infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20</a>].

One study of a small number of tissue and respiratory samples found that 11 of 15 (73 percent) of culture-positive samples were positive by PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Other studies have noted a sensitivity of only 8 to 11 percent in urine or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens that were positive for <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen, while results in CSF and serum were uniformly negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/5,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytology and histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy of a skin lesion, mucous membrane lesion, bone marrow, or other tissue can reveal the typical 2 to 4 micron yeast structures of <em>H. capsulatum</em>. Although the organism sometimes can be demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin stain, it is better visualized using methenamine silver or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stains. In one retrospective review, yeasts were seen using fungal stains in respiratory secretions in 86 percent, lung biopsy in 77 percent, and bone marrow in 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In the unusual circumstance of involvement of vascular structures, as occurs with endocarditis, histopathologic examination may reveal both yeast-like structures and hyphae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F96845\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96845 \">picture 2</a>); the presence of hyphae was a prominent finding in a series of 14 cases of <em>Histoplasma</em> endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Serologic tests for anti-<em>Histoplasma</em> antibodies using the immunodiffusion and complement fixation methods are positive in about 90 percent of immunocompetent and 70 percent of immunocompromised patients with disseminated infection. In immunocompromised patients, detection of antibody can depend upon the population. As an example, in one retrospective analysis, antibody was present in 83 percent of patients who had histoplasmosis and who were receiving TNF inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; however, in a series of patients who had undergone solid organ transplant, only 38 percent had antibody present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The low sensitivity for antibody testing in solid organ transplantation patients is attributed to the suppressive effects of medications used for prevention or treatment of allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>An enzyme immunoassay has been used as a screening test but may be falsely negative in patients who have positive immunodiffusion or complement fixation tests, and thus is not recommended. Although, in patients with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, a newly described enzyme immunoassay appears to be more sensitive than immunodiffusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complement fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-histoplasmosis-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for fungal stains and culture should be performed in patients who are anemic, leukopenic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenic. <em>Histoplasma</em> can also be isolated from other specimens.

Most infections are asymptomatic or self-limited, but some individuals develop acute pulmonary infection or severe and progressive disseminated disease.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common symptoms of disseminated histoplasmosis are fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Symptoms and signs may point to involvement of specific sites, such as the oropharynx, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system (CNS), or adrenal glands. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes malignancy, infection (eg, tuberculosis, other fungal diseases), and inflammatory diseases (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis).
