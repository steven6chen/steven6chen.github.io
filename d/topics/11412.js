The human bacillus <em>M. tuberculosis</em> may have evolved from <em>M. bovis</em> in the setting of animal domestication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, transmission, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of human <em>M. bovis</em> will be reviewed here.

Stated as a proportion, <em>M. bovis</em> causes approximately 1.4 and 2.8 percent of pulmonary tuberculosis cases outside of and within Africa, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Among patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, the proportion of <em>M. bovis</em> is higher because human <em>M. bovis</em> infection generally occurs in the setting of consumption of infected cow's milk products, so scrofula (lymph node) and gastrointestinal disease are important clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In developed countries where <em>M. bovis</em> in cattle is controlled and dairy products are routinely pasteurized, the proportion of <em>M. bovis</em> infection among human tuberculosis cases is often lower than the global estimate. As an example, in the United Kingdom, <em>M. bovis</em> caused approximately 0.5 percent of culture-confirmed human tuberculosis in 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and has been decreasing: between 2005 and 2008, the annual incidence of <em>M. bovis</em> decreased from 0.065 to 0.047 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a Spanish hospital, <em>M. bovis</em> caused approximately 0.95 percent of tuberculosis cases between 1980 and 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the proportion may be higher among certain at-risk populations; as an example, one retrospective study among HIV-infected patients in France noted that <em>M. bovis</em> infection accounted for 1.6 percent of tuberculosis cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In developing countries, reliable national data regarding the relative frequency of human tuberculosis due to <em>M. bovis</em> are rarely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In one Nigerian survey including 444 patients with cultured mycobacterial isolates from 2010 to 2011, only one was confirmed to have <em>M. bovis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Yet in an earlier survey in Nigeria in 2007, 14 percent of human tuberculosis in Nigeria was reportedly due to <em>M. bovis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a retrospective Chinese study including three years of data from more than 5000 patients in a region with known <em>M. bovis</em> cattle infection, <em>M. bovis</em> accounted for 0.34 percent of human tuberculosis cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In Ethiopia between 2000 and 2006, molecular typing of nearly 1000 isolates detected four cases of <em>M. bovis</em>; three of these patients had known regular animal exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In Brazil, no <em>M. bovis</em> isolates were identified among 1674 human isolates recovered using growth media enriched for <em>M. bovis</em> isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26587870\"><span class=\"h3\">United States</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among 59,273 cases of tuberculosis in the United States between 2006 and 2013, <em>M. bovis</em> accounted for 1.3 to 1.6 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In some settings, the proportion is higher and may be increasing. For example, in a retrospective analysis of tuberculosis cases between 1994 and 2005 in San Diego, California, the incidence of <em>M. bovis</em> increased from 0.65 to 0.93 per 100,000 population, while the overall incidence of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> declined from 12.1 to 7.33 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Therefore, the annual proportion of culture-positive tuberculosis cases attributable to <em>M. bovis</em> increased from 5 to 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among children &lt;15 years of age in the same region, <em>M. bovis</em> comprised 54 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In another study in southern California between 2000 and 2007 among 86 patients with HIV and tuberculosis coinfection, 35 percent had <em>M. bovis</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The intrinsic resistance of <em>M. bovis</em> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a> (PZA) is a useful epidemiologic tool. Among more than 79,000 <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex isolates with available susceptibility testing results reported to the United States National Tuberculosis Surveillance System from 1999 to 2009, PZA resistance was observed in 2.7 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. <em>M. bovis</em> accounted for 68 percent of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex isolates with resistance to PZA only and 28 percent with resistance to PZA and at least one other drug.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-drug-susceptible-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-uninfected-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-uninfected adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26587924\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis for tuberculosis due to <em>M. bovis</em> is worse than for disease due to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. In one United States surveillance study including 3291 patients (265 with <em>M. bovis</em>), the relative risk of death due to <em>M. bovis</em> compared with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> was 2.55 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In another study including 35 Mexican patients with <em>M. bovis</em>, 31 percent died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In the Netherlands between 2003 and 2011, mortality due to <em>M. bovis</em> was higher than <em>M. tuberculosis</em> (20 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Among patients with HIV infection, the prognosis for <em>M. bovis</em> coinfection may be worse than the prognosis for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> coinfection. One cohort including 86 HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis in the San Diego, California, area noted a mortality rate of 10 percent (versus 3.6 percent with <em>M. tuberculosis</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In another report including 19 HIV-infected patients with primary multidrug-resistant <em>M. bovis</em>, all patients died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>These observations may be due to delay in recognition of <em>M. bovis</em> infection, inadequate treatment in the setting of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a> resistance, older patient age (due to reactivation disease following remote cattle exposure), or increased virulence of <em>M. bovis</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26587930\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A roadmap to reduce zoonotic TB was developed in 2017 by the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The roadmap calls for a multidisciplinary &quot;One Health&quot; approach that includes improved diagnosis and surveillance and reduced transmission between animals and humans.</p><p>Immunization with bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin and treatment of latent infection are likely as effective for prevention of <em>M. bovis</em> as <em>M. tuberculosis</em>; further study is needed. Infection control precautions for <em>M. bovis</em> should be followed as for <em>M. tuberculosis </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-bovis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H26587851\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In developing countries, minimal data are available regarding the relative frequency of disease due to <em>M. bovis</em> because of limited laboratory facilities for culture and identification. In developed countries, approximately 1 to 2 percent of human tuberculosis cases are attributable to <em>M. bovis</em>; some settings have higher proportions such as the San Diego, California, region, where the proportion of culture-positive tuberculosis cases attributed to <em>M. bovis</em> increased from 3 to 11 percent between 1980 and 2005. (See <a href=\"#H26587857\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for <em>M. bovis</em> infection include consumption of unpasteurized dairy products and contact with infected animals or humans. Among patients diagnosed with tuberculosis, the possibility of <em>M. bovis</em> infection should be considered in the setting of Hispanic ethnicity, age &lt;15 years, immunosuppression, HIV infection, and extrapulmonary disease. (See <a href=\"#H488876\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26587876\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuberculosis due to <em>M. bovis</em> is clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from tuberculosis due to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. Like <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, <em>M. bovis</em> can manifest with primary and reactivation forms; involvement may be pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or disseminated. (See <a href=\"#H26587906\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishing a diagnosis of <em>M. bovis</em> is challenging because distinguishing among members of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> complex is not routinely performed in many laboratories. <em>M. bovis</em> should be considered in the setting of an MTBC isolate with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a> (PZA) monoresistance. State public health laboratories can assist with definitive identification. (See <a href=\"#H26587912\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that treatment of PZA-monoresistant <em>M. bovis</em> consist of two months of daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a>, followed by seven months of isoniazid and rifampin (daily or twice weekly) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Susceptibility testing and expert consultation should guide individualized therapy for polyresistant <em>M. bovis</em>.
