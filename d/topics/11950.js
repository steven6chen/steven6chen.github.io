A nuclear heart test is an imaging test that can show:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much blood flows to your heart muscle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well your heart pumps blood to the rest of your body</p><p/><p>Usually, people have a test called a &quot;stress test&quot; along with a nuclear heart test. A stress test measures how well the heart works when it is pumping very fast. When the heart pumps fast, it needs more blood. A stress test shows if the heart gets enough blood during these times. When a stress test is done with a nuclear heart test, it's called a &quot;nuclear stress test.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27251807\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor order a nuclear heart test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might order a nuclear heart test or a nuclear stress test to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check if your heart muscle is getting enough blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look for certain heart conditions or follow a known heart condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your heart after a heart attack or heart surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See how well your heart pumps blood to the rest of your body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27251814\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for a nuclear heart test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before you have a nuclear heart test, your doctor will ask about all of the medicines you take. He or she might have you stop or change some of your medicines before the test. He or she will tell you when to stop eating and drinking before your test. Your doctor also might ask you not to drink anything that has caffeine in it for 24 hours beforehand.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27251821\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a nuclear heart test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, the doctor, nurse, or technician will do a test called an &quot;electrocardiogram&quot; (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;). An ECG records your heart rate and rhythm by measuring the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Then, the doctor, nurse, or technician will have you lie down on a table. He or she will put an IV (needle) in your arm and put a radioactive substance, called a &quot;tracer,&quot; into the IV. The tracer will travel through the blood to your heart. A camera outside your body will follow the tracer's signals. The camera will take pictures and create images that show the blood flowing to and through your heart.</p><p>If you have a nuclear stress test, you will usually have 1 set of pictures done while you rest, and 1 set done when your heart is pumping fast. Some people might only have the pictures done once, when the heart is pumping fast. To &quot;stress&quot; your heart and raise your heart rate, the doctor will do one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you run or walk on a treadmill (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60855 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you pedal a stationary bike (a bike that doesn't move, except for the pedals)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you medicine to make your heart pump faster &ndash; People who can't exercise can get medicine instead.</p><p/><p>After the stress test, the doctor will take another set of pictures. That way, he or she can compare the results from the 2 different times.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27251828\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of nuclear heart tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nuclear heart tests do involve a small amount of radiation. Too much radiation can cause serious health problems, like cancer. The amount of radiation in a single nuclear heart test will not cause any long-term problems in most people. But your doctor should talk with you about the possible long-term side effects of radiation.</p><p>Other downsides of nuclear heart tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or redness where the IV was in the arm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects from the stress test &ndash; When people exercise and their heart pumps very fast, they can get symptoms such as chest pain, trouble breathing, an abnormal heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27251835\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant, let your doctor know before your start the test. He or she might suggest a different test or postpone the nuclear heart test until after your baby is born.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27251932\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chest pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
