Data are conflicting as to whether the rate is higher in women than in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Fecal incontinence affects 9 percent of women aged 40 to 59 years old and as many as 21 percent of women aged over 80 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Unfortunately, it is often unrecognized by clinicians because patients do not report their symptoms. The emotional, psychological, and social problems created by fecal incontinence can be devastating, debilitating, and costly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Etiology and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The most common cause of fecal incontinence in healthy women is obstetric trauma, which can result in mechanical disruption of the anal sphincter muscles or damage to the nerves that innervate these muscles. The injury may be occult and symptoms may not occur until many years after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. A rectovaginal fistula is another cause of fecal incontinence; it may occur after breakdown of a repair of third or fourth degree lacerations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of pregnancy and childbirth on anal sphincter function and fecal incontinence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-episiotomy#H2751995142\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to episiotomy&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectovaginal-and-anovaginal-fistulas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectovaginal and anovaginal fistulas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Delayed repair of anal sphincter disruption will be reviewed here. The anatomy and physiology of the anal sphincter, pathogenesis of anal sphincter dysfunction, and evaluation of patients with fecal incontinence are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.) Primary surgical repair of anal sphincter injury related to childbirth is also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repair of perineal and other lacerations associated with childbirth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic third and fourth degree lacerations occur from unrecognized obstetric trauma or breakdown of a primary perineal repair after childbirth. Women who suffer from chronic third or fourth degree lacerations typically complain of fecal urgency, and can have incontinence to gas, mucus, liquid, and even solid feces. The severity of symptoms is, at least in part, dependent on the size of the tear, but also on the amount and functionality of the residual muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3235936\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with chronic fourth degree lacerations frequently have complete disruption of the perineal body, as well as the external and internal anal sphincter. Disruption of the sphincter complex occurs anteriorly, and in many patients, the tear is easily identifiable on examination. Occasionally, the tear is less obvious: physical examination alone can miss a tear in as many as 25 percent of women who present with fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Therefore, endoanal ultrasound should always be obtained as part of the evaluation of fecal incontinence and prior to any surgical repair. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative diagnostic studies'</a> below.) In addition, the rectovaginal septum is often attenuated. The anal mucosa usually is in direct proximity to the distal vaginal epithelium; however, in some women, a thin bridge of perineal skin is present between the vaginal and anal epithelium. </p><p>In contrast to most fourth degree lacerations, women with chronic third degree lacerations have a thinned, but intact, perineal body. The radial skin creases of the anal verge are noticeably absent anteriorly, corresponding to the anterior sphincter defect. This appearance is called the &quot;dovetail&quot; sign and indicates the external anal sphincter is not intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The woman should be asked to contract her anal sphincter as part of the examination. Upon voluntary contraction, constriction of the separated end of the external anal sphincter will create dimpling in the perianal skin. The location of the dimpling suggests the location of the snapped sphincter complex. Absence of this dimpling may be due to significant neurologic injury to the sphincter and should alert the clinician that simple anastomosis may not completely cure the incontinence.</p><p>After the external examination, an internal rectovaginal examination is essential. The examiner inserts an index finger into the anal canal while the thumb is inserted into the distal vagina. The presence or absence of intact muscle between the two fingers is assessed using a &quot;pinch and drag&quot; maneuver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of preoperative diagnostic studies in patients with disrupted anal sphincter is to confirm the diagnosis (if appropriate) and determine anatomic features important both to surgical planning and prognostic counseling. Appropriate patient selection for sphincter repairs is guided by preoperative endoanal ultrasound, anorectal physiology testing with anorectal manometry, and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276282179\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoanal ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoanal ultrasound is by far the most useful clinical tool for the diagnosis of anal sphincter disruption. Both the external and internal anal sphincter are easily visualized by this modality, which can be used to confirm anal sphincter disruption and help the surgeon identify the location of the snapped ends of the anal sphincter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76163\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76163 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endorectal-endoscopic-ultrasound-in-the-evaluation-of-fecal-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endorectal endoscopic ultrasound in the evaluation of fecal incontinence&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276282186\"><span class=\"h2\">Anorectal physiology tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of anorectal physiology testing in predicting outcomes is controversial and poorly studied. At our institution, all patients with fecal incontinence are tested with both anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve testing at the time of their initial surgical consultation. The results of these tests are then used to educate the patients considering sphincteroplasty about their potential functional outcomes after surgery. However, given that data on the ability of anorectal physiology testing to predict outcomes are mostly retrospective, no individual test result in isolation is ever used to deny patients the opportunity for a sphincteroplasty as long as they understand that their testing results, when worrisome, mean there is an increased risk that surgery may not lead to an improvement in function.</p><p>Anorectal physiology testing is performed with either an air or water charged catheter system. Anal resting and squeeze pressures are calculated at each centimeter starting at 6 cm from the anal verge. The high pressure zone is identified and then mean resting pressure, maximum resting pressure, and maximum Squeeze pressure are calculated using the definitions of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean resting pressure is the mean of the resting pressures recorded within the high-pressure zone. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum resting pressure is the highest resting pressure recorded. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximum squeeze pressure is the highest pressure recorded above the baseline (zero) at any level of the anal canal during maximum squeeze effort. </p><p/><p>Patients with low pressures on anorectal manometry are informed that retrospective studies show that patients with low preoperative mean resting and squeeze pressures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a short anal canal showed more improvement in these measurements postoperatively than those with higher preoperative pressures and a longer anal canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. They are also told that this postoperative improvement in pressures does not necessarily result in a better functional outcome, as measured by patient questionnaires. Patients who have high anal pressures on anorectal manometry are generally discouraged from undergoing sphincter repair without considering alternative treatment approaches first, such as sensitivity retraining, biofeedback, dietary modification, and sacral nerve stimulation. We feel that surgical repair is less likely to be successful in significantly augmenting sphincter function in this situation.</p><p>Pudendal nerve testing is performed by gently inserting a digital electrode into the rectum to stimulate the pudendal nerve. The time from pudendal nerve stimulation to the first contraction of the external sphincter is electronically recorded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51112\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51112 \">figure 1</a>). Patients who have unilateral or bilateral pudendal neuropathy are informed that some studies show that they may have a lower chance of a successful functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. An observational study found that patients with bilateral normal pudendal nerve function have a 60 percent success rate after surgery, whereas patients with unilateral or no pudendal nerve function have only a 17 percent chance of a satisfactory functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276282982\"><span class=\"h1\">COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients considering sphincteroplasty should be thoroughly informed about their chances for a successful functional outcome after surgery. In the absence of anorectal physiology testing and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency testing, they should understand that this procedure is most effective in women with moderate fecal incontinence (weekly loss of partial or complete solid bowel movements) or severe fecal incontinence (daily loss of complete solid bowel movements). Mild incontinence of gas, loss of liquid bowel movements, and occasional staining are less likely to improve with surgery. In fact, a repair can lead to worsening symptoms if a surgical complication occurs.</p><p>An ideal candidate for surgery is less than 60 years old, has symptoms of weekly loss of solid bowel movements, and tests results showing low anorectal manometry pressures with good pudendal nerve conduction. Unfortunately, even in this highly selected group of patients, complete functional success only occurs in approximately 60 percent of patients, and the long-term success rate drops to 25 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>As discussed above, unilateral or absent pudendal nerve function lowers success rates from 60 percent to 17 percent at a median of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, setting realistic short- and long-term expectations is an important part of the preoperative counseling that needs to be offered to these patients, and we find anorectal physiology testing results helpful during this discussion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bowel preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is no evidence-based guideline for a preoperative bowel regimen before anal surgery, common practice is a bowel prep before sphincter repair to diminish bacterial contamination of the perineal wound. For example, Nulytely or Golytely the night before surgery can be used as a mechanical bowel preparation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An antibiotic regimen that covers skin and enteric flora should be administered preoperatively. Appropriate regimens for patients with and without beta-lactam allergy, as well as the evidence behind these recommendations, can be found separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 1</a>).

The snapped ends of the external anal sphincter muscle are identified where they connect to the anterior perineal body scar created by the injury. The scar and the external sphincter muscles are carefully freed from the internal sphincter to allow the left and right external sphincter and scar complexes to overlap anteriorly. The scar connection to the muscle should not be trimmed off, as it is utilized in the repair. During this dissection, care should be taken not to extend the original incision and the final dissection laterally beyond the 180 degree circumference of the anus, as this may injure the pudendal nerves and thus compromise functional outcomes. </p><p>In situations where the internal anal sphincter is also injured anteriorly, both internal and external sphincters are mobilized en block to create the overlapping repair. Although some surgeons advocate separate dissection of the internal and external sphincters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], we and others believe that this extra step is difficult to perform and does not necessarily translate in better function postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3235957\"><span class=\"h2\">Repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following mobilization of the external (and, if injured, the internal) anal sphincter, some surgeons, including myself, perform a levatorplasty to lengthen the anal canal, believing that this added maneuver may improve functional outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This can be accomplished with one or two interrupted nonabsorbable polypropylene sutures. </p><p>We use an overlap technique to attach the snapped ends of the external anal sphincter and the perineal body scar, which are sutured to each other with a nonabsorbable horizontal mattress stitch. These sutures should be placed in the scar, since the sutures are more likely to hold if placed in fibrous tissue. The goal is to create an overlap that forms a circumferential functioning muscular tunnel that surrounds the anal canal. Preservation of scar minimizes the lateral dissection necessary to create this tunnel and thus decreases the risk of injury to the pudendal nerves, which run laterally to the anal sphincter. Retrospective data suggest that preservation and utilization of scar in the overlap repair may improve short-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and long-term functional outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, no data from randomized trials are available to support this recommendation.</p><p>For acute repair of obstetric anal sphincter tears, where no scar is present to allow for an overlapping repair, the advantages of an overlapping sphincteroplasty as opposed to an end-to-end anastomosis are less clear. Though an overlapping repair has been advocated by some experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/16,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22</a>], most randomized trials have not demonstrated statistical or clinical superiority of this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>], with one exception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a 2013 meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing the overlap and end-to-end techniques, the overlap technique was associated with a non-statistical lower risk of one or more anal incontinence symptoms (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68-1.17; five trials, n = 2221), but this was primarily in the first 12 months after delivery and disappeared at 24 and 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Limitations of these studies were the inclusion of multiparous women and women with partial tears, and differences in measurement of outcomes and surgical experience. </p><p>Imbrication of the external anal sphincter provides an alternative in patients who have attenuation of the sphincter with incomplete disruptions and patients with wide lateral retraction of the muscle edges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Lastly, the subcutaneous tissue and the skin are loosely closed with interrupted absorbable sutures. This allows drainage, which is important given the high risk of postoperative wound infections in these patients.</p><p>Diverting colostomy does not improve functional results or healing following repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. We typically reserve colostomy for selected patients who present particularly challenging cases, such as some patients with Crohn&rsquo;s disease or recurrent sphincter repair. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3235964\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The small number of surgical trials for treatment of fecal incontinence (all causes), their small sample sizes, and methodological weaknesses make it impossible to identify clinically important differences among alternative surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14616580\"><span class=\"h3\">Sacral nerve stimulator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sacral nerve stimulator improves fecal continence in patients with disrupted anal sphincters, including those with previously failed overlapping sphincteroplasty. Over 80 percent of patients achieve a &ge;50 percent reduction from baseline in incontinent episodes per week, with sustained long-term results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Traditionally, this approach is reserved as a reasonable first-line option for patients who are not good candidates for an overlapping sphincteroplasty or who failed a sphincteroplasty or who prefer a nonsurgical approach. Surgical repair is generally less costly than sacral nerve stimulation, but is also more likely to have complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management#H553034908\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Management&quot;, section on 'Sacral nerve stimulation'</a>.)</p><p>However, subsequent studies suggest the people may benefit from sacral nerve stimulation even when sphincter injuries are not repaired first. A retrospective comparison of patients treated with sacral nerve stimulation as an alternative to a sphincter repair reported a trend towards better results when sphincter repair was omitted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This raises the possibility that many patients with sphincter injuries may develop eventual fecal incontinence from causes unrelated to this injury, such as bowel dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14616587\"><span class=\"h3\">Artificial sphincter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insertion of an artificial bowel sphincter is effective in motivated patients who understand its high risks for wound infection and device malfunction and who have enough tissue between the rectum and the vagina to allow device placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Expert opinions differ on whether a high fiber or low residue diet should be prescribed for the first month postoperatively. In general, immediately after surgery, we prescribe an oral laxative, such as milk of magnesia or polyethylene glycol, which can be given for the first few weeks to avoid constipation and to ensure that the patient is having loose stools. Two or three weeks later, we switch to a high fiber supplement such as Benefiber or Metamucil. A trial of women undergoing primary repair of third degree anal sphincter tears randomly assigned them to bowel confinement (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> phosphate 60 mg orally three times daily) or laxatives (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> 10 mL orally three times daily) for the first three postoperative days and found no difference between groups in continence scores, anal manometry, and endoanal ultrasound findings three months after the repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

However, mechanical injury to the continence mechanism is often associated with nonreversible neurologic injury that may become progressive with age and menopause.</p><p>Patients treated surgically also benefit from adjuvant treatments such as dietary manipulation, pharmacologic management, and behavioral and biofeedback techniques. As an example, biofeedback has been used to improve functional outcomes in patients with persistent fecal incontinence despite successful anatomical reapproximation of the anal sphincter complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delayed-surgical-management-of-the-disrupted-anal-sphincter/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management#H898962499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Management&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE OBSTETRICAL DELIVERIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have a secondary repair of an anal sphincter rupture should be thoroughly counseled regarding future pregnancy and deliveries. Experts recommend that a woman with persistent fecal incontinence and a poorly functioning anal sphincter despite secondary repair be offered a planned cesarean for subsequent deliveries. Clear recommendations cannot be made, however, regarding repeat vaginal deliveries versus cesarian sections in the women without residual fecal incontinence following an uneventful sphincter repair at the time of a vaginal delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of pregnancy and childbirth on anal sphincter function and fecal incontinence&quot;, section on 'Recurrence with subsequent vaginal delivery'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of pregnancy and childbirth on anal sphincter function and fecal incontinence&quot;, section on 'Approach to obstetric management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cause of fecal incontinence in healthy women is obstetric trauma that results in mechanical disruption to the anal sphincter muscles, damage to the nerves that innervate these muscles, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> formation of a rectovaginal fistula. (See <a href=\"#H3235929\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of sphincter repair is reconstruction of a muscular cylinder to surround the anal canal and allow for circumferential muscular contraction upon attempts to defer defecation.
