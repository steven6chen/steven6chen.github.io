These histiocytes, along with lymphocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils may infiltrate nearly every organ (most notably the skin, lymph nodes, lungs, thymus, liver, spleen, bone marrow, or central nervous system with the exception of the heart and kidneys).</p><p>LCH is so named because the morphology and immunophenotype of the pathologic cells resemble Langerhans cells, which are specialized dendritic cells found in the skin and mucosa. However, LCH is derived from myeloid progenitor cells from the bone marrow, and is not derived from the Langerhans cell of the skin.</p><p>For now, &quot;Langerhans cell histiocytosis&quot; remains the preferred nomenclature; the historical terms histiocytosis-X, Letterer-Siwe disease, Hand-Sch&uuml;ller-Christian disease, and diffuse reticuloendotheliosis have been abandoned. The term &quot;eosinophilic granuloma&quot; is sometimes used to describe the pathology of an individual lesion, particularly isolated lytic processes in bone.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of LCH will be presented here. The management of LCH is presented separately, as are specific discussions of solitary LCH involving lung or bone.

Large published studies usually are from referral centers and the disorder is likely under-diagnosed in the general population. LCH has been diagnosed in all age groups, but is most common in children from one to three years old. The incidence appears to be three to five cases per million children, which is the same as pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma, and one to two cases per million adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p>A male predominance has been described in some case series, but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. The incidence appears to be higher in whites of northern European descent than in blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An epidemiologic study from the United States suggested a connection between solvent exposure in parents, as well as perinatal infections, but no increased incidence after viral epidemics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pulmonary LCH is a rare disorder occurring in adults that is nearly universally associated with cigarette smoking, whereas extrapulmonary LCH does not appear to have any association with smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Role of cigarette smoking'</a>.)</p><p>The genetics of LCH have not been well elucidated. There is no evidence that relatives of patients with LCH are at increased risk of developing LCH. Very rarely are twins or singleton siblings concordantly affected, despite a few reported cases with early disease presentation and similar organs affected in presumed monozygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One report described three cases with skin and bone involvement in one Iranian family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Another study noted an association with a family history of thyroid disease, but the meaning of this finding is not understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Rarely, LCH has been described in patients with other concomitant histiocytic disorders, such as Erdheim-Chester Disease and Rosai Dorfman Disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452648797\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discovery that the pathologic Langerhans cells (LC) were myeloid dendritic cells came from gene expression array data showing a clear distinction of these cells from the skin Langerhans cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Subsequently it was shown that the pathologic LC carrying the <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation could be identified in CD34+ stem cells and more mature myeloid dendritic cells of LCH patients, thus proving that LCH is a clonal myeloid malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A mouse model of LCH with enforced expression of the <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation in myeloid dendritic cells confirmed the observation. Subsequent work with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and the related histiocytic disorder Erdheim-Chester disease tracked the <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation in subsets of dendritic cells, mature monocytes, committed myeloid progenitors, and CD34+ cells of affected LCH patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Somatic mutations that activate the MAPK signaling pathway are detectable in most patients with LCH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/18,21-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21-27</a>]. Examples of such studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mass spectrometric method was used to analyze for a large number of cancer-associated gene mutations in DNA retrieved from paraffin-embedded biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The oncogenic <em>BRAF V600E</em> mutation was found in 35 of 61 (57 percent) cases of LCH. Interestingly, in all cases (<em>BRAF</em> mutated or not), the downstream BRAF targets MEK and ERK were phosphorylated, suggesting a common mechanism of activation of the signal transduction pathway regardless of <em>BRAF</em> mutation status. The <em>BRAF V600E</em> mutation was also detected in 40 percent of adult pulmonary LCH specimens tested. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 135 biopsies from 100 children with LCH showed that the <em>BRAF </em>V600E mutation was present in 63 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There was no statistical difference between those with wild type or mutated <em>BRAF</em> regarding age, gender, high or low risk clinical status, or number of lesions. Circulating <em>BRAF </em>V600E mutated cells were detected in all patients with high risk LCH, and, when found in low risk patients, portended a 70 percent chance of relapse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, <em>BRAF </em>V600E-mutations were identified in 173 of 315 patients (55 percent) and were associated with a more severe clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. <em>BRAF </em>V600E<em> </em>mutations were identified in the majority of patients with multisystem disease with risk organ involvement (88 percent) and those with multisystem disease without risk organ involvement (69 percent), and were less common among patients presenting with low risk, single system disease (42 percent). Approximately three-quarters of patients with pituitary and neurodegenerative conditions had the mutation. Patients with <em>BRAF </em>V600E mutations were more likely to have resistance to initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and higher reactivation rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whole-exome sequencing identified mutations in <em>MAP2K1</em>, which encodes MEK1, in 7 of 21 LCH tumors with wild-type <em>BRAF</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This mutation ultimately resulted in the phosphorylation and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway.</p><p/><p>Further study is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of LCH. It is unclear if the pathogenesis differs between pulmonary LCH in adults and LCH in children. Langerhans cells in adult lung lesions were shown to be mature dendritic cells expressing high levels of the accessory molecules B7-1 and B7-2, unlike LC found in other lung disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452648804\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452648812\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of patients with LCH varies depending upon the sites and extent of involvement. The disease is limited to one organ system (eg, bone) in approximately 55 percent of patients, while the remainder presents with multisystem disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As an example, a retrospective analysis of 1741 patients with LCH registered in prospective trials reported involvement of the following areas at the time of diagnosis, in order of decreasing frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone &ndash; 77 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin &ndash; 39 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph nodes &ndash; 19 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver &ndash; 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spleen &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral mucosa &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung &ndash; 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system &ndash; 6 percent</p><p/><p>The areas of involvement and the extent of disease vary at least partially with patient age. Acute disseminated multisystem disease is most commonly seen in children less than three years, while a more indolent disease involving a single organ is more common in older children and adults. Presenting symptoms in adults from published studies are (in order of decreasing frequency): skin rash, dyspnea or tachypnea, polydipsia and polyuria, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, fever, gingival hypertrophy, ataxia, and memory problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. In general, patients can be divided into two groups based upon the extent of involvement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single system LCH &ndash; Patients may be of any age and typically do not have systemic symptoms (eg, weight loss or fever). Unifocal or multifocal involvement can be found in one of the following <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/systems:</span> bone, skin, lymph node (excluding draining lymph node of another LCH lesion), lungs, central nervous system, or other rare locations (eg, thyroid, thymus).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multisystem LCH &ndash; Two or more <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/systems</span> are involved with or without involvement of &quot;risk organs.&quot; Risk organs include the hematopoietic system, liver, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spleen and denote a worse prognosis. Although the lung has been considered a &quot;risk organ&quot;, more recent studies have suggested that it has less of an effect on prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In contrast &quot;CNS-risk&quot; areas include the sphenoid, orbital, ethmoid, or temporal bones and denote an increased risk of involvement of the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p>Disease tempo is variable and the length of time from the first symptom(s) to diagnosis can be frustratingly long. Many adults wait one to four years before the correct diagnosis is made, and some have symptoms for 5 to 20 years. In this setting, diabetes insipidus is often the initial symptom, sometimes starting in childhood and not recognized as being caused by LCH until other symptoms occur later in the course of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452648841\"><span class=\"h2\">Lytic bone lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone involvement occurs in the majority of patients with LCH. Although some lesions are asymptomatic, the patient may complain of pain in a localized area of bone; examination usually reveals a raised, soft, tender spot. Radiologic studies typically demonstrate a lytic, &quot;punched out&quot; appearance, sometimes with an accompanying soft tissue mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56235\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56235 \">image 1</a>).

In children, the most frequent sites of involvement are the skull (40 percent), femur, rib, vertebra, and humerus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The digits are involved only in the most diffuse cases. In contrast, the primary sites of bone involvement in adults in one study were jaw (30 percent), skull (21 percent), vertebra (13 percent), pelvis (13 percent), extremity (17 percent), and rib (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Involvement of certain bones can cause problems with nearby organ systems. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spine lesions in children are most often located in the cervical vertebrae and are frequently associated with other bone lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although vertebra plana (symmetrical vertebral flattening) may develop in some, others have stabilization of the vertebrae after treatment and spinal deformity is rare. In a series of adults with LCH of the spine, neurologic defects occurred in 21 of 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Asymmetric collapse as opposed to vertebra plana was more common in adults. Of 33 vertebral lesions, 21 were in the cervical spine, seven in the thoracic, and five in the lumbar spine. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of the calvaria, base of the skull, maxillofacial bones, and hypothalamic-pituitary axis is common. Resulting complaints include scalp <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> facial swelling, seizures, hearing loss, recurrent otitis media, gingival bleeding, proptosis, diabetes insipidus, and cranial nerve palsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Pain in the jaw and loose teeth may be a presenting symptom. Although bone lesions may be asymptomatic in some areas, those in the mouth are especially troublesome because of tooth loss and a high recurrence rate. Posterior regions of the jawbones are affected more often than anterior regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p>Some skull lesions are not only lytic but may have an accompanying mass that impinges on the dura. Lesions of the facial bones or anterior or middle cranial fossae (eg, temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, zygomatic) with intracranial tumor extension are part of a &quot;CNS-risk&quot; group. Patients with these lesions have a threefold increased risk for developing diabetes insipidus and an increased risk of other central nervous system (CNS) disease. (See <a href=\"#H452648890\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes insipidus and other endocrinopathies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H452662508\" class=\"local\">'Central nervous system'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452648848\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin and oral mucosa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin involvement is seen in approximately 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The most common skin manifestations are brown to purplish papules referred to as congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis and an eczematous rash resembling a candidal infection. Other skin lesions may be pustular, purpuric, petechial, vesicular, or papulo-nodular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brown to purplish papules</strong> &ndash; Infants may present with brown to purplish papules over any part of their body (congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis, Hashimoto-Pritzker disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75074\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75074 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. If solitary, this manifestation is benign and the lesions disappear during the first year of life with no therapy. However, neonates with apparently isolated skin involvement need thorough evaluation to confirm that no other sites are involved, as well as close follow-up for later risk organ involvement.

Lesions range in size from 1 to 10 mm in diameter. Seborrheic involvement of the scalp may be mistaken for prolonged &quot;cradle cap&quot; in infants or a severe case of seborrheic dermatitis in older individuals.

Macrophage activation seen in LCH patients may be a result of excessive cytokine expression in these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

A biopsy of an osteolytic bone lesion or skin lesion is generally preferred. The surgeon should <strong>not</strong> perform a wide excision as LCH bone lesions will have complete or near complete healing with curettage alone or chemotherapy. Biopsy of the pituitary may be required for the definitive diagnosis of a solitary pituitary lesion, but is more invasive and dependent upon the size of the lesion and comfort of the neurosurgeon. For patients with suspected disease isolated to the pituitary, identification of <em>BRAF-V600E</em> in the peripheral blood or cerebrospinal fluid can support the diagnosis, although it does not distinguish LCH from Erdheim-Chester disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. It is reasonable to initiate therapy empirically in such patients with a plan to follow disease response with MRI. </p><p>While Langerhans cells can be recognized on the basis of morphologic criteria, their identity must be confirmed either by positive immunohistochemical staining for CD1a and CD207 or by the identification of Birbeck granules by electron microscopy. Electron microscopy to identify Birbeck granules is performed less frequently because of time and expense. </p><p>LCH can be difficult to diagnose since it is an uncommon disease that can affect many organ systems. LCH in bone, lymph nodes, thymus, liver or spleen can be confused with lymphomas, solid tumors, or primary CNS tumors including germinoma and meningioma. Cutaneous involvement can mimic vasculitis, cutaneous lymphoma, or cutaneous involvement with Erdheim-Chester disease (see below). Pulmonary involvement can have the clinical appearance of any number of interstitial lung diseases. LCH must be distinguished histologically and immuno-phenotypically from other histiocytic and dendritic cell disorders, metastatic solid or hematopoietic neoplasms, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytic and macrophage activation syndromes. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) &ndash; ECD is a rare multisystem histiocytic disorder, most often seen in adults, that may be confused with LCH. Histiocytic infiltration leads to xanthogranulomatous infiltrates of multiple organ systems (eg, skin, lung, bone, cerebral, facial, orbital and retro-orbital tissue, pituitary, retroperitoneum, cardiovascular system). These cells may be very similar to those of juvenile xanthogranuloma, as both diseases most likely derive from the same lineage of <span class=\"nowrap\">dermal/interstitial</span> dendrocyte [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Long bone pain and symmetric osteosclerotic lesions suggest this diagnosis, which is confirmed by tissue biopsies showing histiocytes with non-Langerhans features (eg, negative for CD1a and S-100 protein). Cases of concomitant LCH and ECD (ie, mixed histiocytosis) have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

JXG belongs to the broad group of non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses and is typically a disorder of early childhood. JXG presents in the first two years of life as a solitary reddish or yellowish skin papule or nodule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69122\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69122 \">picture 6</a>), most often on the head, neck, and upper trunk. Histologically, JXG is characterized by the presence of foamy or Touton giant cells. JXG generally follows a benign course with spontaneous resolution over a period of a few years. Less commonly, skin lesions can be multiple (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81058 \">picture 7</a>). Extracutaneous or systemic forms (brain, lung, kidney, spleen, liver, bone marrow, and retro-orbital tumors) are exceedingly rare and can be associated with considerable morbidity.

LCH can readily be distinguished from multiple myeloma by histologic and immunophenotypic findings on biopsy and the presence of a monoclonal protein in the serum of patient with multiple myeloma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) &ndash; HLH and the related macrophage activation syndrome are systemic disorders that demonstrate tissue infiltration by non-neoplastic histiocytes. Unlike LCH, these disorders may demonstrate prominent hemophagocytic activity in the bone marrow, and are characterized by fever, splenomegaly, and a constellation of laboratory findings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an underlying genetic defect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rosai-Dorfman disease (sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy) is a macrophage-related disorder that most often presents as a systemic disorder involving lymph nodes and other organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/85-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-87</a>], or can rarely be limited to the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>]. Although the pathologic cells in RDD and HLH are the macrophages (CD14+, CD1a-, <span class=\"nowrap\">S100+/-,</span> CD68+), RDD is histologically distinct from the other histiocytic diseases because the macrophages have normal-appearing lymphocytes residing in the macrophage cytoplasm (emperipolesis) unlike the hemophagocytosis of HLH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H452648790\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of patients with LCH varies depending upon the sites and extent of involvement. The disease is limited to one organ system (eg, bone) in approximately half of patients. Acute disseminated multisystem disease is most commonly seen in children less than three years old, while a more indolent disease involving a single organ is more common in older children and adults. (See <a href=\"#H452648812\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone involvement occurs in the majority of patients and can involve any bone of the body. Although some lesions are asymptomatic, the patient may complain of pain in a localized area of bone; examination usually reveals a raised, soft, tender mass. Radiologic studies typically demonstrate a lytic, &quot;punched out&quot; appearance, sometimes with an accompanying soft tissue mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56235\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56235 \">image 1</a>).

The most common skin manifestations are an eczematous rash resembling a candidal infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F57722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57722 \">picture 2A</a>) or ulcerative lesions in the axillae, inguinal folds, genitalia, or peri-anal regions. A much less common manifestation is the Hashimoto-Pritzker variant rash, which consists of brown to purplish papules in infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75074\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75074 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H452648848\" class=\"local\">'Skin and oral mucosa'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung involvement occurs in approximately 10 percent of cases. It is less frequent in children than in adults, in whom smoking is a key etiologic factor. Patients with lung involvement may be asymptomatic or present following a spontaneous pneumothorax or with nonproductive cough, dyspnea, chest pain, or constitutional symptoms. The most sensitive diagnostic test is a high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan, which reveals cysts and nodules characteristic of LCH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69891\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69891 \">image 2B</a>).

Lesions of facial bones or bones of the anterior or middle cranial fossae are &quot;CNS-risk&quot; lesions with an almost 25 percent incidence of CNS involvement. The most common symptoms of CNS involvement are diabetes insipidus and symptoms of neurodegeneration (ataxia, cognitive dysfunction). Findings on magnetic resonance imaging include thickening of the pituitary stalk; enhancement of the pons, basal ganglia, and white matter of the cerebellum; mass lesions; and meningeal enhancement.
