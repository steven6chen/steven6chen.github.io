Loss of intestinal fluid caused by gastroenteritis may lead to severe hypovolemia, shock, and death, particularly in children younger than five years of age in areas of the world with limited resources. In developed countries, such as the United States, diarrhea caused by gastroenteritis remains a major cause of hospitalizations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the total number of deaths globally from diarrheal diseases from gastroenteritis remains high, the overall mortality rate has steadily declined over the last few decades. This decline, especially in developing countries, is largely due to the use of early and appropriate oral rehydration therapy (ORT), improved nutrition and water sanitation measures, and effective vaccination for rotavirus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-limited-countries#H1159942574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited countries&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>The composition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a> and the clinical application of ORT in patients with diarrhea due to gastroenteritis are discussed in this topic review. The assessment and treatment of hypovolemia, and prevention and treatment of viral gastroenteritis in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-viral-gastroenteritis-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries-management-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute viral gastroenteritis in children in resource-rich countries: Management and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H405704614\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS OF HYPOVOLEMIA AND DEHYDRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms volume depletion (hypovolemia) and dehydration often are used interchangeably. However, these terms differentiate physiologic conditions resulting from different types of fluid loss. Much of the clinical literature does not differentiate between the two terms and uses them interchangeably. Thus, we will follow this convention and use the terms hypovolemia, volume depletion, and dehydration interchangeably as referring to all types of fluid deficits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although oral rehydration therapy (ORT) was first introduced in 1945, its use declined because of reports of multiple cases of hypernatremia due to the use of oral rehydration solution (ORS) with inappropriately high carbohydrate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the success of intravenous (IV) hydration in decreasing mortality and morbidity in children with diarrhea in developing countries led to renewed efforts in the 1960s to develop an effective ORT that would be less expensive and easier to administer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Subsequently, improvements in ORS formulations have led to ORT's successful use in treating hypovolemia caused by gastroenteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

Studies from the 1960s showed an ORS formulation that is isotonic with equimolar concentrations of glucose and sodium is as effective as IV hydration in treating hypovolemia in patients with cholera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Based upon these results, the WHO changed the formulation of ORS in 2002 from an osmolality of 311 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L</span> to 245 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L,</span> and concentrations of glucose from 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span> (111 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> to 13.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span> (75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and sodium from 90 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. The new formulation preserved the molar 1:1 ratio of sodium and glucose, and is the only ORS used globally by the WHO.</p><p>Although there were initial concerns that the reduced-osmolality ORS may result in hyponatremia for patients with cholera who often have diarrheal losses of sodium concentration of 90 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> a large observational study in Bangladesh reported that the incidence of symptomatic hyponatremia was rare in both children and adults in a study population where 20 percent of the patients were presumed to have cholera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Although other alternative solutes have been studied (eg zinc, prebiotics, glucose polymers, L-isoleucine) with some promising results, there are not conclusive data that they are more effective than glucose. As a result, we continue to recommend the use of the WHO formulation containing 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of sodium and 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> of glucose with an osmolarity of 245 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L</span> water.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymer-based formulations &ndash; Polymer-based ORS use rice, wheat, and sorghum as a source of starch rather than glucose. Starch is broken down slowly into glucose molecules by amylase in the small intestine. A systematic review showed that the polymer-based ORS is more effective than high osmolarity glucose-based ORS (&ge;310 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L)</span> in reducing stool volume and duration of diarrhea for patients with acute watery diarrhea due to cholera or other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, data were insufficient to show that polymer-based ORS is superior to glucose-based ORS with lower osmolarity (&le;270 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L</span> water). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As a result, until further data demonstrate that polymer-based ORS is significantly more beneficial than the standard ORS (osmolality 245 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L),</span> we concur with the recommendation of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) <strong>not to </strong>recommend initial use of polymer-based ORS either in developing or developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These formulations have not been shown to be more effective than the standard WHO or commercial ORS, which are more readily available and less costly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other carrier solutes &ndash; Formulations that use maltodextrins or rice, or add amino acids (glycine, alanine, and glutamine) to glucose are <strong>not</strong> more effective than standard ORS, and are more costly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

This was best illustrated in a 2010 meta-analysis that included three low-quality studies showing diarrhea-specific mortality was lower in communities in which oral rehydration solution (ORS) was promoted compared with control communities without ORS promotion (0.2 versus 0.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In addition, clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that ORT is as effective as intravenous (IV) rehydration therapy in treating hypovolemia from diarrheal illness due to gastroenteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/5,6,19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,19-25</a>].

Advantages of ORT compared with intravenous (IV) hydration include lower cost, easier to administer, less invasive intervention, and treatment that can be done or continued at home.

A standard commercially prepared and premixed oral rehydration solution (ORS) is recommended for use in nonmedical settings because major errors can occur when homemade solutions using sugar and sodium are administered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67494 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Care providers need to recognize signs of illness or treatment failure requiring medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Assessment of the patient at home with gastroenteritis is discussed elsewhere.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medically supervised setting &ndash; Prior to initiation of ORT, the child who presents to a medical clinician's office, the ED, or an urgent care facility with diarrhea should be evaluated to determine the underlying etiology of diarrhea and whether further diagnostic testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intervention is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is evidence that rehydration is appropriate, ORT using a standard commercial formulation should be initiated if the patient has mild to moderate hypovolemia and there are no contraindications to enteral therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">ORT based on degree of dehydration</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1554589336\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of dehydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the decision is made to begin hydration therapy, clinical assessment of the patient's hydration status is necessary, as it guides clinical decisions in the use of ORT. The goal of hydration assessment for patients with diarrhea is to determine the fluid management approach for individuals as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify patients who are not dehydrated and can be safely sent home with ORT maintenance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify patients who are mildly to moderately dehydrated, in whom ORT is the preferred therapy for rehydration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify patients who are severely dehydrated and require IV rehydration</p><p/><p>Traditionally, attempts have been made to differentiate between mild and moderate hypovolemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76198\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76198 \">table 2</a>). However, it is often clinically difficult to distinguish between the two degrees of dehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As a result, experts in the field, including the author, group these patients and use the same management approach, as the observed signs or symptoms overlap and encompass a relatively wide range of fluid deficits (ie, from 3 to 9 percent volume depletion). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-and-diagnosis-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment and diagnosis of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;, section on 'Degree of hypovolemia'</a>.)</p><p>The following sections outline recommendations for ORT based on guidelines from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN), and European Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases (ESPID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/14,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,28</a>]. These guidelines are based on data acquired from efficacy trials conducted in both developing and developed countries.</p><p>Treatment is divided into two phases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rehydration phase &ndash; The fluid deficit is replaced quickly over three to four hours, returning the patient to a euvolemic state. ORS is administered in frequent, small amounts of fluid by spoon or syringe. A nasogastric tube can be used in the child who refuses to drink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/28,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30-32</a>]. Each aliquot given must be small enough to avoid accumulation of a large amount of fluid in the stomach that might trigger vomiting. Five mL (one teaspoon), administered every one to two minutes, allows as much as 150 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> to be given. If the patient is breastfed, breastfeeding continues during this phase as well as during the maintenance phase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance phase &ndash; Maintenance calories and fluids are administered. Rapid realimentation begins after completion of the rehydration phase, with the goal to return the patient to an age-appropriate unrestricted diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance fluid therapy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>During both phases, ongoing losses from diarrhea and vomiting are replaced with ORS. If the losses can be measured accurately, 1 mL of ORS should be administered for each gram of diarrheal stool. Alternatively, 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of body weight of ORS should be administered for each watery or loose stool, and 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of body weight for each episode of emesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">No dehydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with diarrhea but no evidence of dehydration, ORT is used to maintain hydration by replacement of stool losses, as outlined above. If the stool output is minimal, ORS may not be required. Regardless of stool output, age-appropriate feeding (including breastfeeding) should be continued along with supplemental fluids.

Commercially available ORS vary in osmolality and sodium concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67494 \">table 1</a>). All commercial ORS contain 2 to 3 percent carbohydrate, as glucose, rice, or other cereal; this amount is sufficient to maintain nutritional status in the short term (24 to 48 hours) while avoiding a large osmotic load in the intestinal lumen. Studies in the United States demonstrated successful treatment with commonly used commercial ORS in children with mild to moderate dehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/23,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,36</a>]. In children between 5 and 10 years of age, sucralose-sweetened ORS solutions (eg, Pedialyte and Pediatric Electrolyte) appear to be more palatable than comparable rice-based solutions (eg, Enfalyte) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Based on the available data, the differences in composition between commercially available products and the 2002 WHO ORS do not appear to be significant when administered to children with diarrhea in developed countries. (See <a href=\"#H405707237\" class=\"local\">'ORS properties'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3232641603\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapeutic measures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H571930197\"><span class=\"h3\">Common household beverages and fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commonly used household fluids for children with gastroenteritis include gelatin, tea, fruit juice, sports drinks, and soft drinks. These fluids have much lower sodium concentration, and nearly all have a much higher carbohydrate and osmolality content than commercial and standard ORS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67494 \">table 1</a>). As a result, they have not been recommended as an alternative to commercial standard ORS for rehydration in children with gastroenteritis because of concerns that they could induce osmotic diarrhea resulting in hyponatremia. However, a Canadian clinical trial in children between 6 to 60 months of age with mild gastroenteritis and no clinical signs of dehydration demonstrated that half-strength apple juice (diluted 1:1 apple juice:water) compared to apple-flavored commercial standard ORS resulted in fewer episodes of treatment failure (17 versus 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In this single-center study, treatment failure was defined as any of the following events occurring within seven days of enrollment: IV rehydration, hospitalization, subsequent unscheduled physician encounter, protracted symptoms, crossover to the other fluid, and 3 percent or more weight loss or signs of significant dehydration based on an in-person follow-up visit. Following emergency department discharge, the group assigned to half-strength apple juice were allowed to consume whatever fluids the children desired to replace ongoing losses, and the ORS group continued with electrolyte maintenance solution. These results show that diluted apple juice followed by a permissive approach to fluids consumption can be used to maintain hydration in young children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration in high-income countries.</p><p>On the other hand, chicken soup with a high sodium concentration may result in hypernatremia, and should be avoided as a rehydration fluid source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H405708678\"><span class=\"h3\">Zinc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zinc supplementation should be administered in children with diarrhea in developing countries, in which there is a high prevalence of zinc deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

In a 2011 survey, 44 of the 94 pediatric emergency clinicians from the United States (47 percent) reported using ORT as initial therapy in children with moderate dehydration compared with 103 of 136 Canadian clinicians (76 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This may reflect findings from an early report of American emergency clinicians who preferred IV hydration to ORT in treating moderate dehydration in children with gastroenteritis, even among those who indicated familiarity with the guidelines promoting ORT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These results demonstrate the need for continued efforts to educate care providers on the benefits of ORT over IV hydration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expense &ndash; The cost of commercially available ORS may limit its home use in low socioeconomic families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

ORT is as effective as intravenous (IV) hydration to treat hypovolemia in patients with gastroenteritis, but is less invasive and costly, and easier to administer. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'ORT based on degree of dehydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that a standard commercially prepared oral rehydration solution (ORS) or one available from the World Health Organization (WHO), which has equimolar concentrations of glucose and sodium and an osmolality between 200 and 310 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L,</span> be used for ORT in children with clinical signs of dehydration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67494 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, for children with mild gastroenteritis and no clinical signs of dehydration, half-strength apple juice is a reasonable option for ORT. Homemade solutions that use sugar and sodium should not be used because of the risk of major errors. (See <a href=\"#H405707237\" class=\"local\">'ORS properties'</a> above and <a href=\"#H405705466\" class=\"local\">'Setting'</a> above and <a href=\"#H571930197\" class=\"local\">'Common household beverages and fluids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ORT is contraindicated in patients with impaired mental status at risk for aspiration, abdominal ileus or other conditions that preclude adequate fluid absorption from the intestinal tract, severe hypovolemia, or persistent vomiting. IV hydration should be administrated to patients with these conditions as well as to those who fail ORT. Specifically, in patients with severe dehydration, emergent IV therapy is required with rapid infusion of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of isotonic saline. Once the patient is stable, ORT can be started. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the following approach for patients with gastroenteritis and mild, moderate, or no hypovolemia, which divides ORT into rehydration and maintenance phases (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In both phases, ongoing losses from diarrhea and vomiting are replaced with ORS. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'ORT based on degree of dehydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rehydration &ndash; In patients with mild or moderate hypovolemia, ORS is administrated in frequent small amounts, no more than 5 mL administered every one to two minutes by spoon or syringe, for a total volume of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> replaced quickly over three to four hours. If the patient is breastfed, breastfeeding is maintained during the rehydration phase and is continued into the maintenance phase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintenance &ndash; During the maintenance phase, maintenance calories and fluids are administered to replace ongoing losses. Rapid realimentation begins after completion of the rehydration phase, with the goal to return the patient to an age-appropriate unrestricted diet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H433708981\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Bonita Stanton, MD, Joshua B Evans, MD, and Bobby Batra, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-rehydration-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Santosham M, Keenan EM, Tulloch J, et al.
