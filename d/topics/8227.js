These bumps can cause so much pain that they make it hard to move. They can smell bad or drain pus or blood. The bumps also tend to linger for weeks or months and keep coming back.</p><p>People who have hidradenitis suppurativa, also called &quot;HS,&quot; often have a hard time dealing with their problem. It can make them feel embarrassed and worried. Sometimes the condition can even cause problems in relationships, or in the workplace. If you have this problem, see a doctor or nurse. There are treatments that can help you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258689313\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of HS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptoms are red, swollen, painful bumps. These bumps can drain pus or blood.</p><p>The bumps usually form in places where the skin rubs together. Common locations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Armpits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On or under the breasts (in women)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the groin area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inner thighs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Buttocks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Around or near the anus</p><p/><p>The skin problems caused by HS last a long time and get worse over time. Often the skin hardens and scars around the painful bumps. Plus, many bumps can form in a single area and sometimes form tunnels under the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258689328\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of HS, see a doctor or nurse. He or she can look at your skin and find out if HS is the cause of your symptoms. Make sure you tell the doctor or nurse if you feel sad or embarrassed because of your symptoms. The doctor or nurse can help you deal with these problems.</p><p>It's also important to see your doctor regularly if you have HS. People with HS have a higher chance of getting other health problems, too, such as diabetes and heart disease. Your doctor can check for these problems and suggest treatment if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258689343\"><span class=\"h1\">How is HS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic liquids or gels that you put on the affected areas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic pills, which you might need to take for a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injections of steroid medicines into affected areas to bring down inflammation</p><p/><p>Women with HS sometimes also take hormone treatments to improve their condition. This usually involves taking a birth control pill every day. Sometimes women take other types of hormone medicines, too.</p><p>People with severe, long-lasting problems can have surgery that helps HS to heal. They can also get special medicines that can reduce inflammation in the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258689358\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. First, you should know that you did not do anything to cause your condition. It is not your fault. You did not cause it by being unclean. You should also know that you cannot spread your condition to anyone else. It is not &quot;contagious.&quot;</p><p>Here are some things you can do to reduce your symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not wear tight-fitting clothes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to avoid activities that cause your skin to rub against itself a lot</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shower every day and wash areas of HS gently with your fingers. Do not scrub affected areas with a washcloth, loofah, or brush.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking, if you smoke. People who smoke are more likely to have HS</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight. HS is more common and more severe in people who are overweight.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
