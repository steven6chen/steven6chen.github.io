Infliximab is available for treatment of patients with moderately to severely active Crohn disease, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy and for patients with fistulizing Crohn disease.</p><p>TNF-alpha has several biologic activities that may be directly related to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and there is evidence suggesting a central role for TNF-alpha in Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infliximab-in-crohn-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, stool TNF-alpha levels are elevated in patients with Crohn disease and correlate with disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infliximab-in-crohn-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-and-microbial-mechanisms-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune and microbial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Infliximab</a> neutralizes the biologic activity of TNF-alpha by inhibiting binding to its receptors.

A study from the Cleveland Clinic included 100 patients with inflammatory or fistulous Crohn disease who were followed for at least three months after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infliximab-in-crohn-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In those with inflammatory disease, an initial response was significantly more likely in nonsmokers (73 versus 22 percent) and in those taking concurrent immunosuppressive medications (74 versus 39 percent). A prolonged response (more than two months) was also more likely in nonsmokers (59 versus 6 percent) and in those taking concomitant immunosuppressive medications (65 versus 18 percent). For those with fistulous disease, overall response rates were not different between smokers and nonsmokers, but nonsmokers had a longer duration of response. Concurrent use of immunosuppressive medications had no effect on the rate or duration of response. However, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and 6-MP has been associated with an increased risk of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.

Thus, these data do not support a causal role for infliximab in development of SSOs.</p><p>Because the risk of developing obstruction cannot be predicted accurately in advance, patients with significant strictures should be informed of the possibility that complete obstruction could occur following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infliximab-in-crohn-disease/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].
