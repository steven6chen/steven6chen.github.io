Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors are rare, comprising only 1.2 percent of all primary ovarian cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In contrast with epithelial ovarian cancer, most patients with malignant sex cord-stromal tumors are diagnosed with early-stage disease; the tumors are generally considered to be low-grade malignancies. </p><p>Sex cord-stromal tumors include granulosa cell tumors (which differentiate toward female characteristics), fibroma-thecomas, and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (which differentiate toward male characteristics). Granulosa-stromal cell tumors include granulosa cell tumors, thecomas, and fibromas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. They account for 70 percent of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors. Among granulosa-stromal cell tumors, fibromas are the most common histology. These tumors occur with equal frequency among pre- and postmenopausal women.</p><p>Granulosa cell, theca cell, and mixed tumors are usually hormonally active, in contrast to fibromas, which do not produce hormones. Granulosa cell tumors are more often malignant than thecomas or fibromas, which are most often benign.</p><p>Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors of the granulosa-stromal cell type (granulosa cell tumors, fibromas, and thecomas) are reviewed here. An overview of sex cord-stromal tumors and other types of sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary (Sertoli-stromal cell tumors and tumors with granulosa and Sertoli-Leydig elements), as well as epithelial ovarian cancer, are discussed separately.

They are the most common type of potentially malignant ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor; they comprise 2 to 5 percent of all ovarian malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There are two subtypes, adult and juvenile. The adult subtype, which occurs most commonly in middle-aged and older women (median age, 50 to 54 years), comprises 95 percent of these neoplasms.</p><p>The juvenile type comprises 5 percent of all granulosa cell tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They typically develop before puberty, and thus, are more common among children and young women. This subtype tends to have a higher proliferative rate than the adult type and a lower risk for late recurrences.</p><p>The discussion below relates mainly to the adult subtype.</p><p>Granulosa cell tumors appear to be more common in women who are nonwhite, obese (body mass index &gt;30), and have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The risk appears to be decreased in women who are current or past smokers or users of oral contraceptive pills, and in those who are parous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gross appearance of granulosa cell tumors is variable. The neoplasms are usually large and unilateral, and can be soft or firm depending upon the relationships of stroma, particularly collagen to neoplastic cells. They are often multicystic and may resemble a mucinous cystadenoma or be filled with serous fluid or clotted blood. Accumulation of lipids results in yellow color.</p><p>Histologically, granulosa cells of the adult subtype appear round, pale, with scant cytoplasm, and classic &quot;coffee-bean&quot; grooved nuclei; atypia and mitoses are typically not frequent, but do occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79902\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79902 \">picture 1</a>). The cells may arrange themselves in small clusters or rosettes around a central cavity. These arrangements, which are termed &quot;Call-Exner bodies,&quot; resemble primordial follicles and, when diffusely present, constitute a microfollicular pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Lack of Call-Exner bodies is not infrequent.</p><p>By contrast, the juvenile subtype has a macrofollicular or cystic pattern and is composed of immature granulosa cells with frequent mitoses; Call-Exner bodies and coffee-bean grooved nuclei are not frequent.</p><p>While the better-differentiated granulosa cell tumors may have various patterns, including microfollicular, macrofollicular, trabecular, solid-trabecular, and insular, less well-differentiated tumors have a more diffuse pattern, designated as sarcomatoid. Other pattern types are diffuse, cylindroid, pseudoadenomatous, or mixed, depending upon the predominant histologic elements. These various patterns are not particularly important, but can render recognition as granulosa cell tumor difficult.</p><p>Theca cells, which are luteinized cells within the stroma, are present in about 70 percent of cases. Theca cells produce androstenedione, a weak androgen, and granulosa cells convert the androstenedione to estradiol. Significant hormone production is responsible for the clinical phenotype associated with the neoplasm. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>The histologic diagnosis is facilitated by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) using antibodies against markers of sex cord-stromal differentiation. Inhibin is the most sensitive and specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Calretinin is typically positive, but is not specific for sex cord-stromal differentiation. Other markers, including CD99, m&uuml;llerian inhibiting substance, vimentin, WT1, SF-1, cytokeratin, S-100 protein, and smooth muscle actin, are not specific and are not particularly helpful in distinguishing between granulosa cell tumor and its mimics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, even positivity for inhibin is not absolutely specific for an ovarian sex cord tumor, as sex cord-stromal differentiation can be seen in other neoplasms. As an example, in one report, positive IHC for inhibin was present in 94 percent of granulosa cell tumors and in 10 to 20 percent of ovarian endometrioid tumors and metastatic carcinomas to the ovary (although with significantly weaker staining intensity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In the future, molecular testing for mutations in the <em>FOXL2</em> gene may improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with sex cord-stromal tumors. Somatic mutations in this gene, which play a role in the development of normal granulosa cells, have been identified in 97 percent of adult-type granulosa cell tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. By contrast, the mutation was identified in only 1 of 10 juvenile-type granulosa cell tumors and 3 of 14 thecomas (21 percent), while it was absent in sex cord-stromal tumors of other types and in other ovarian neoplasms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulosa cell tumors typically present as large masses; the mean diameter is 12 cm. Women may present with an asymptomatic mass noted on abdominal or pelvic examination.</p><p>Granulosa cell tumors often produce estrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone; consequently, symptoms related to hyperestrogenism are common at diagnosis. In a review of 118 patients with granulosa cell tumors, 55 percent had hyperestrogenic findings, including hyperplastic endometrium and abnormal uterine bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Increased production of estrogen may also cause breast tenderness, postmenopausal bleeding, menstrual abnormalities, and, in children, sexual precocity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-evaluation-of-precocious-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and evaluation of precocious puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a well-documented association between granulosa cell tumors and endometrial neoplasms (complex endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For this reason, preoperative endometrial biopsy is suggested in all women with abnormal uterine bleeding, all postmenopausal women with an adnexal mass and a thickened (&ge;5 mm) endometrial stripe, and in the occasional patient who has a preoperative diagnosis of ovarian granulosa cell tumor. Endometrial biopsy will detect endometrial <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperplasia/intraepithelial</span> neoplasia in 25 to 50 percent of women with granulosa cell tumors and carcinoma in 5 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The endometrial adenocarcinomas that are associated with granulosa-stromal cell tumors are usually early stage and well differentiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Nonspecific symptoms or signs associated with these neoplasms include ascites, increasing abdominal girth, abdominal pain due to torsion, intraneoplasmal hemorrhage, or tumor rupture and hemoperitoneum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of a granulosa cell tumor is made by histology at the time of surgical excision. Preoperatively, a granulosa cell tumor should be suspected based upon the presence of a large adnexal mass, if accompanied by the signs of hyperestrogenism described in the preceding section. Ultrasonographic findings (an echogenic, septated cystic or solid mass related to the ovary) are typically nonspecific. Surgery is required for histologic diagnosis as well as staging (staging is the best determination of potential malignant behavior) and treatment.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of a woman who presents with both an adnexal mass and abnormal vaginal bleeding should also include ovarian metastasis from a primary uterine cancer, an endometrial metastasis from a primary ovarian malignant neoplasm, and separate primary ovarian and endometrial carcinomas.</p><p>The hormonal activity of granulosa cell tumors permits the use of a variety of serum tumor markers in the diagnostic evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55817 \">table 1</a>). These markers include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibin &ndash; Clinically, the most useful serum marker for granulosa cell tumors is inhibin, a peptide that is produced by the ovaries in response to follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. Inhibin usually becomes undetectable after menopause, unless produced by certain ovarian tumors, mostly mucinous epithelial ovarian carcinomas and granulosa cell tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>]. <br/><br/>Inhibin exists as two different isoforms, inhibin A and inhibin B. Both isoforms consist of a dimer of two subunits, the alpha and beta subunits. The alpha subunit is the same for both isoforms, while the beta subunits differ (beta A and beta B); they show about 64 percent homology. The three subunits (alpha, beta A, beta B) are produced on separate genes located on chromosomes 2 (alpha and beta B subunit) and 7 (beta A subunit). <br/><br/>In general, both inhibin A and inhibin B should be ordered, if possible, when following patients with granulosa cell tumors. Although most commercial laboratories only provide assays for inhibin A, serum levels of inhibin B seem to be more frequently elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The free alpha subunit can also be measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].<br/><br/>The diagnostic performance of inhibin levels is poor. An elevated inhibin level in a premenopausal woman presenting with amenorrhea and infertility or in a postmenopausal woman is suggestive of the presence of a granulosa cell tumor, but not specific. Conversely, both inhibin A and B may be negative in patients with active granulosa cell tumors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) &ndash; One observational cohort study of 123 women has demonstrated that monitoring both AMH and inhibin was superior to inhibin alone in detecting macroscopic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estradiol was one of the first markers identified in the serum of patients with granulosa cell tumors. In general, however, estradiol is not a sensitive marker for the presence of a granulosa cell tumor. Approximately 30 percent of these neoplasms do not produce estradiol, perhaps related to the lack of theca cells, which produce androstenedione, a necessary precursor for estradiol synthesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Androgens &ndash; In rare cases, granulosa cell tumors may produce androgens, such as testosterone, which may result in the patient presenting with virilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M&uuml;llerian inhibiting substance (MIS), which is produced by granulosa cells in the developing follicles, has emerged as a potential tumor marker for granulosa cell tumors. As with inhibin, MIS is typically undetectable in postmenopausal women. Although an elevated MIS level appears to be highly specific for ovarian granulosa cell tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>], this test is not available for clinical use.</p><p/><p>Practically speaking, standard surveillance for patients with granulosa cell tumor should include monitoring of serum inhibins and, possibly, AMH. In addition, if a patient is noted to have an elevated level of either estradiol or testosterone at the time of diagnosis, then subsequent monitoring should include measurement of that serum marker as well. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical staging and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulosa cell tumors are staged surgically according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) ovarian cancer staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 2</a>). A total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended for women who are done with childbearing. Assessment of stage is the most important factor in determining prognosis and to guide postoperative treatment recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The rarity of lymph node metastasis at initial diagnosis suggests that pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy may be omitted as part of surgical staging for these neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. However, this is dependent upon whether an intraoperative diagnosis of a granulosa cell tumor can be made, since the diagnosis may not have been made preoperatively and is difficult to confirm during surgery.</p><p>Granulosa cell tumors are generally confined to one ovary. For women with stage I disease who wish to preserve fertility or avoid exogenous hormone replacement, a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and uterine preservation with other procedures for complete surgical staging are appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75194\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75194 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Retrospective studies suggest an equivalent cure rate for early-stage disease whether treated by unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The contralateral ovary should be carefully inspected; biopsy is necessary only if an abnormality is found.</p><p>Due to the risk of endometrial neoplasia, if an endometrial biopsy was not performed preoperatively, a dilation and curettage should be performed during surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery alone is acceptable treatment for most women with granulosa cell tumors, since the majority are stage IA and confined to one ovary at the time of diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Long-term disease-free survival rates are approximately 90 percent.</p><p>Outcomes are less favorable for women with higher-stage disease and for those with stage I disease whose tumor has ruptured, has nuclear atypia, or a high mitotic index. There are conflicting reports regarding the prognostic influence of other factors such as positive cytology, tumor size, ovarian surface involvement, and ploidy status. Further studies are needed in this area. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>Although postoperative or adjuvant therapy is often considered for such patients, the rarity of these neoplasms makes it difficult to conduct well-designed randomized studies to define the value of any such strategy. As a result, the benefit of postoperative treatment for women with stage IC to IV disease is unclear, and practice is variable. Some centers recommend adjuvant therapy for all women with stage IC to IV disease, others recommend adjuvant therapy only for women with residual disease after surgery, and still others do not recommend adjuvant therapy for any stage of disease, treating only at the time of a recurrence.</p><p>The following represents the range of findings regarding the benefit of adjuvant therapy from observational studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with advanced-stage juvenile granulosa cell tumors, adjuvant chemotherapy appears to contribute to long-lasting complete remission and is usually recommended for those with stage IC disease and a high mitotic index (&ge;20 per 10 high power fields [HPF]), as well as those with more advanced-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/40-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-46</a>].

The vast majority of the luteinized thecomas are bilateral.</p><p>Although luteinized thecomas are considered benign, it is the associated sclerosing peritonitis that may cause significant morbidity, including severe adhesions, intestinal obstruction, fistulas, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>]. The cause of the sclerosing peritonitis is unknown, but the most popular theories involve either some type of inciting agent that causes both the ovarian pathology and the peritoneal fibrosis, or the secretion of some type of substance by the ovaries that results in the associated peritoneal fibrosis. There have been reports of an association between this entity and anti-seizure medications, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, or peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/105-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">105-107</a>].</p><p>Although there is no standard treatment beyond surgery, regression of both luteinized thecomas and sclerosing peritoneal disease has been reported with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy, antiestrogen hormones, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/103,108-111\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,108-111</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22494399\"><span class=\"h1\">FIBROTHECOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term fibrothecoma is used by some experts to refer to a neoplasm with features that are intermediate between a fibroma and a thecoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. There is no universal agreement on which neoplasms should be classified as a fibrothecoma rather than either a fibroma or thecoma; however, many neoplasms have mixtures of these cell types. </p><p>Hormonal activity of these neoplasms depends upon the extent to which they resemble fibromas (lipid poor, hormonally inert) or thecomas (lipid containing, hormonally active) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/112,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,113</a>]. Fibrothecomas may be either benign or malignant, although they are most commonly benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/114,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,115</a>]. The risk of malignancy is difficult to predict due to inconsistent classification and the paucity of data regarding these neoplasms. Of note, women with a significant amount of hormonally active thecoma elements are at risk for endometrial neoplasia, similar to pure thecomas. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Thecoma'</a> above.)</p><p>Pelvic imaging can certainly narrow the differential diagnosis of an adnexal mass, but there is nothing pathognomonic about the ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance of fibrothecomas. Typically, they appear as a solid ovarian mass and are considered worrisome for malignant neoplasm. The sonographic appearance of these neoplasms is usually nonspecific. On MRI, fibrothecomas typically have low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and very low signal intensity on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/116-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-118</a>]. Large fibrothecomas may have areas of edema and cystic degeneration. However, there is one report indicating that dual-echo chemical shift MRI may be a useful method for detecting small amounts of lipid in thecomas versus the fibrous tissue in fibromas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary-granulosa-stromal-cell-tumors/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. But once again, stromal tumors may contain both thecoma elements and fibroma elements (hence &quot;fibrothecoma&quot;), so this distinction is probably of very limited clinical benefit. </p><p>Ultimately, regardless of imaging findings, removal of the mass is required, since these lesions are neoplastic. The diagnosis is made based upon histology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Granulosa cell tumor</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Granulosa cell tumors are generally large and unilateral and have malignant potential. They are categorized into two subtypes, adult and juvenile. The adult subtype is more common and occurs mostly in middle-aged and older women, while the juvenile subtype occurs mostly in children and young women. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These neoplasms often produce estrogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55817 \">table 1</a>). Granulosa cell tumors typically present as a large adnexal mass frequently with signs of hyperestrogenism (abnormal uterine bleeding, endometrial neoplasia, breast tenderness, and, in children, precocious puberty). We recommend endometrial sampling pre- or intraoperatively to exclude asymptomatic endometrial neoplasm (carcinoma or its precursor) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Surgical staging and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for women with granulosa cell tumors who have completed childbearing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For women with stage I disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 2</a>) who wish to preserve childbearing capacity or avoid estrogen therapy, we suggest unilateral oophorectomy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Surgical staging and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a course of postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy for all women with resected stage IC to IV disease because of the high risk of disease progression and the potential for long-term survival in women with advanced disease who receive modern platinum-based chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, others disagree, either recommending chemotherapy only for women who are left with measurable residual disease following surgery, or withholding adjuvant chemotherapy for all women regardless of stage, and treating only at the time of recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For recurrent localized disease, we suggest surgical resection, if feasible (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We suggest chemotherapy rather than surgery alone for patients with metastatic or suboptimally cytoreduced disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Radiation may be appropriate as primary treatment or as an adjunctive therapy following surgery in selected patients with recurrence confined to the pelvis.

(See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Fibroma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend oophorectomy for diagnosis and cure for women with ovarian fibromas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
