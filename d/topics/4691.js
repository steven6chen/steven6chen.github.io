The most common clinical manifestations of HPV infection are warts (verrucae). There are over 150 distinct HPV subtypes; some tend to infect specific body sites. HPV type 1 commonly infects the soles of the feet and produces plantar warts, while HPV types 6 and 11 infect the anogenital area and cause anogenital warts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical findings and management of cutaneous warts (including common, plantar, and flat warts) will be reviewed here.

Predisposing conditions for extensive or recalcitrant involvement include atopic dermatitis and conditions associated with decreased cell-mediated immunity (eg, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS], organ transplantation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) occurs by direct skin contact, with maceration or sites of trauma predisposing patients to inoculation. Latent HPV infection also may occur in normal skin. The reservoir for HPV appears to be individuals with clinical or subclinical infection. Transmission via inanimate objects has been proposed but has not been proven. The incubation period is approximately two to six months.</p><p>Spontaneous remission of warts occurs in two-thirds of children within two years; spontaneous resolution in adults tends to be slower and may take up to several years or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Warts in patients with intact cellular immunity are the most likely to regress without therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Recurrence is common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous warts may manifest as common warts (verruca vulgaris), plantar warts (verruca plantaris), and flat (plane) warts (verruca plana) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72086%7EDERM%2F51139%7EDERM%2F58825%7EDERM%2F70615%7EDERM%2F56924%7EPC%2F72268%7EDERM%2F53424%7EDERM%2F66188\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72086 graphicRef51139 graphicRef58825 graphicRef70615 graphicRef56924 graphicRef72268 graphicRef53424 graphicRef66188 \">picture 1A-H</a>). </p><p>Cutaneous warts are also described based upon location (eg, periungual warts) or morphology (eg, filiform or mosaic warts). Warts may occur singly, in groups, or as coalescing warts forming plaques. Mosaic warts are coalescing plantar warts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of cutaneous warts is based upon clinical appearance. Paring of overlying hyperkeratotic debris on plantar or common warts usually reveals thrombosed capillaries, a feature that can help with diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53424\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53424 \">picture 1G</a>). If dermoscopy is performed, the thrombosed capillaries may appear as homogenous black to red dots and globules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Palmar and plantar warts classically obscure normal skin markings, also known as dermatoglyphics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53424\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53424 \">picture 1G</a>). Rarely, a biopsy is indicated to confirm the diagnosis.

Filiform warts may be pedunculated but have finger-like keratotic projections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F66188\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66188 \">picture 1H</a>).

A symmetric distribution, Wickham's striae, and oral involvement suggest lichen planus. Lichen nitidus typically presents as numerous 1 to 2 mm smooth papules that have a more round appearance than flat warts.

Common approaches include chemical or physical destruction of affected tissue (eg, salicylic acid, cryotherapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cantharidin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cantharidin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichloroacetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trichloroacetic acid</a>, surgery, laser), enhancement of the local immune response (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, topical or intralesional immunotherapy), and antiproliferative therapy (eg, 5-fluorouracil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>High-quality studies of therapeutic interventions are limited, complicating definitive recommendations on the best approach to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In general, the approach is dependent upon the type of wart (ie, common, plantar, flat, or filiform) and influenced by wart location, treatment side effects, clinician skill, and patient preference. For children, the ability to tolerate discomfort impacts treatment selection. (See <a href=\"#H189033171\" class=\"local\">'Common warts and plantar warts'</a> below and <a href=\"#H189033521\" class=\"local\">'Flat warts'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1056977163\" class=\"local\">'Filiform warts'</a> below.)</p><p>The endpoint of treatment is the absence of visible warts. On the soles of the feet or palms, the reappearance of normal dermatoglyphics (skin lines) supports resolution. However, clinical resolution does not confirm eradication of the virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189041472\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The option to defer treatment should be discussed with patients or their guardians. Although most warts in immunocompetent patients eventually resolve without treatment, warts may spread or persist and resolution is unpredictable.</p><p>Many wart therapies require prolonged treatment or multiple office visits and have inconsistent efficacy. Clinicians should communicate expectations for the treatment course as well as the possibility of treatment failure and recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189033171\"><span class=\"h2\">Common warts and plantar warts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the treatment is similar for common warts (verruca vulgaris) and plantar warts (verruca plantaris).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189033178\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical salicylic acid and cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen are the most common treatments for common and plantar warts and have the strongest evidence for efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Plantar warts may be less likely to respond than common warts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Salicylic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical salicylic acid exfoliates the affected epidermis and may also stimulate local immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Advantages of salicylic acid include self-administration, painless application, and minimal risk for serious side effects.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; A 2012 meta-analysis of randomized trials found salicylic acid superior to placebo for clearance of warts (relative risk [RR] 1.56, 95% CI 1.20-2.03) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Reports of the likelihood of wart clearance following salicylic acid therapy range from 0 to more than 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; Products containing salicylic acid in concentrations between 17 and 50% are typically used for treatment. The higher 40 to 50% concentrations are usually reserved for application to sites with a thick stratum corneum, such as the palms or soles. Salicylic acid is available in liquid, ointment, pad, and patch forms. In the United States, concentrations above 40% are available as compounded products.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Salicylic acid is applied directly to the wart. Skin should be dry prior to application. Application is typically repeated daily. Duct tape or other tape is useful for securely attaching salicylic acid pads and occluding salicylic acid ointment on the skin. If tape is used, the tape and salicylic acid can be replaced every 48 hours. Salicylic acid treatment should not extend beyond 12 weeks without assessment by a clinician.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Paring of the wart should be repeated periodically to minimize build-up of hyperkeratotic debris. Soaking the wart for five minutes can facilitate paring and removal of hyperkeratotic debris. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Salicylic acid is often combined with other wart treatments in an attempt to improve the response. We often combine salicylic acid therapy with cryotherapy, with salicylic acid applied between cryotherapy treatments. Data to confirm benefit are limited. A meta-analysis of two randomized trials found greater benefit of combination therapy with a topical salicylic <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/lactic</span> acid product and cryotherapy compared with topical treatment alone for hand warts but not foot warts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3140176\" class=\"local\">'Cryotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Side effects </strong>&ndash; Local skin irritation is a common and expected side effect. If significant, the frequency of application should be reduced. Salicylic acid should not be used in patients with peripheral neuropathy due to a reduced ability to detect tissue damage and increased risk for poor healing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3140176\"><span class=\"h4\">Cryotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is a common clinician-administered treatment. A disadvantage of cryotherapy is the pain associated with treatment. As a result, cryotherapy is primarily used for warts in older children and adults and often avoided in young children.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; Cure rates from cryotherapy in randomized trials range from 14 to more than 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although a statistically significant benefit of liquid nitrogen cryotherapy over placebo was not detected in a 2012 meta-analysis of randomized trials (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.65-3.23), the meta-analysis did not find a significant difference in efficacy between cryotherapy and salicylic acid, which appeared to be more effective than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Salicylic acid'</a> above). A randomized trial that compared cryotherapy (applied via cotton bud every two weeks until wart resolution) with salicylic acid 40% ointment (applied daily under tape occlusion until wart resolution) and no treatment for common warts found cryotherapy more effective than salicylic acid and no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration </strong>&ndash; Plantar warts and other hyperkeratotic warts should be pared before treatment. Liquid nitrogen can be administered with a cryospray or a cotton bud dipped in liquid nitrogen. Wart virus can survive in liquid nitrogen; therefore, dispensing a small aliquot of liquid nitrogen into a disposable cup is recommended rather than dipping cotton buds into a communal flask [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The goal is to create a visibly frozen area that includes the wart and approximately 2 mm of the surrounding normal skin and disappears within 30 to 60 seconds after application. Two freeze-thaw cycles may lead to improved resolution of thick or plantar warts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment is repeated every two to three weeks until wart resolution. If a response does not occur within six treatments, it is reasonable to transition to an alternative treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cryotherapy should be applied cautiously on the digits to prevent severe pain and possible neuropathy. Periungual warts should be treated with caution due to avoid damage to the nail matrix and permanent nail dystrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cryotherapy is often combined with salicylic acid treatment in an attempt to augment efficacy. However, greater benefit of this combination compared with cryotherapy alone is not proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Salicylic acid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Side effects </strong>&ndash; The acute response to cryotherapy ranges from minimal erythema to hemorrhagic blistering, pain, and tenderness. Healing usually occurs within four to seven days. Local hypopigmentation can occur, and patients with dark skin should be treated with caution. Occasionally, blistering can result in spread of the virus to adjacent skin, resulting in a larger wart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189034438\"><span class=\"h3\">Refractory warts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best approach to treatment-refractory warts is unclear. Therapies such as topical immunotherapy with contact allergens, intralesional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, and topical 5-fluorouracil may be beneficial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189034675\"><span class=\"h4\">Topical immunotherapy with contact allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data suggest that contact allergens, such as squaric acid dibutylester (SADBE), dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), and diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), can be effective treatments. An advantage of topical immunotherapy is the ease of treating multiple warts simultaneously.</p><p>Topical immunotherapy should be performed by clinicians with experience in this procedure. Treatment is usually administered by a dermatologist.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>&ndash; Among these agents, only DNCB has been evaluated in randomized trials. A meta-analysis of two small randomized trials with a total of 80 patients suggested that DNCB is more effective than placebo (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.38-3.26) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The efficacy of SADBE is supported by an uncontrolled study of 568 adults and children with multiple and resistant warts in which sensitization with 3% SADBE was followed by twice-weekly clinician applications of serial dilutions of SADBE (0.03 to 3%) for up to 10 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of the 443 patients who completed the study, 382 had complete resolution of warts (86 percent). The average time to resolution of periungual or subungual warts, flat warts, and multiple common warts were 10, 8, and 6 weeks, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are multiple reports of successful treatment with DPCP, many involving warts refractory to other therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/14-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-24</a>]. An uncontrolled prospective study of 134 adolescents and adults with refractory palmoplantar or periungual warts found that among 111 patients who completed the study (treatment with DPCP once weekly for eight weeks and a follow-up period of four months), 49 (44 percent) achieved a complete response and 18 (16 percent) had partial improvement by the end of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Two retrospective studies have reported higher rates of clearance among patients who have complied with treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, successful treatment with DPCP has been reported in immunosuppressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Descriptions of these three trials are provided below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 61 children and adolescents (ages 3 to 22) concluded that covering warts with duct tape was more effective than cryotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Treatment involved keeping the wart covered with duct tape for cycles lasting six days and then removing the tape, soaking the wart, debriding the wart with an emery board or pumice stone, and then leaving the wart uncovered on the sixth night; the duct tape was reapplied the next morning. Treatment was continued until wart resolution or for a maximum of two months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Resolution rates were significantly higher with duct tape than with cryotherapy (85 versus 60 percent). The majority of warts that resolved with duct tape did so within 28 days of treatment; warts were unlikely to resolve if no response was seen within two weeks. There were nine patients lost to follow-up, and blinding of evaluators was limited.

Patients were treated with either a clear brand of duct tape according to the protocol above or with a corn pad (a ring of material surrounding the wart, intended as a placebo) one night per week; both groups also performed soaking and debridement one night per week as per the protocol above. The evaluator was blinded to treatment for most patients, and no patients were lost to follow-up. After six weeks, rates of wart resolution were similar in the duct tape and corn pad groups (16 versus 6 percent, p = 0.12) and much lower than the rates seen in the earlier trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar trial comparing a clear brand of duct tape with a control treatment with a moleskin pad in 90 adults also found no difference in the rate of wart resolution at the end of two months (21 versus 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p>Participants in the latter two trials that used clear duct tape apparently found the duct tape to be much more difficult to keep applied. The researchers in the adult trial were initially informed by the manufacturer that the clear duct tape had the same adhesive as their standard silver duct tape; however, they later learned that silver duct tape from that manufacturer uses a rubber-based adhesive and clear duct tape an acrylic-based adhesive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Alternatively, the less rigorous design of the earlier trial could have led to a false conclusion of benefit.</p><p>In summary, it remains uncertain whether duct tape is effective. In patients who are treated with duct tape, it would make sense to choose a silver brand that is adequately sticky to remain on the skin. In nondiabetic patients with no peripheral artery disease and no neuropathy who are free from skin erosions, duct tape can be combined with salicylic acid applied to the wart itself and not the surrounding skin.

However, the efficacy of most interventions for flat warts has not been evaluated in randomized trials, and data are insufficient for conclusions on comparative efficacy.</p><p>Cryotherapy and topical medications such as salicylic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-tretinoin-topical-all-trans-retinoic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical tretinoin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>], and 5-FU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>] are among the most common treatments. The mechanisms of action of cryotherapy, salicylic acid, imiquimod, and 5-FU are likely similar to their mechanisms for common and plantar warts; the efficacy of topical tretinoin may involve the induction of a local irritant reaction.</p><p>Cryotherapy sessions are often repeated every three to four weeks as needed. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-tretinoin-topical-all-trans-retinoic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Topical tretinoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, and 5-FU are usually applied on a daily basis, with a response expected within several weeks.</p><p>The side effects of treatments should be carefully considered prior to treatment selection, particularly for flat warts on cosmetically sensitive areas such as the face. Although salicylic acid and cryotherapy are well-accepted first-line treatments for nonfacial flat warts, salicylic acid is usually avoided for facial flat warts because of the absence of significant hyperkeratosis and the potential for excessive skin irritation. Similarly, cryotherapy is often avoided for facial flat warts because of risk for hypopigmentation. In our practices, we typically use tretinoin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, or 5-FU as first-line treatments for flat warts on the face. Of note, these topical treatments may cause skin irritation resulting in postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Patients with dark skin are at greatest risk for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.</p><p>Less common treatments reported effective in small numbers of patients include glycolic acid 15% plus salicylic acid 2% [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cantharidin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cantharidin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], topical potassium hydroxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>], topical Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc sulfate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], oral propolis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>], topical contact immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/19,86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,86,87</a>], intralesional immunotherapy with <em>Candida</em> antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>], photodynamic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>], pulsed dye laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/54,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,91</a>], frequency-doubled Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>], and acupuncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> (30 mg per day) was more beneficial than placebo in a randomized trial of 29 patients with recalcitrant facial flat warts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Surgical removal of filiform warts can be performed with a &quot;snip excision&quot; using surgical scissors or shave removal. Electrodessication or topical aluminum chloride is useful for hemostasis.</p><p>Cryotherapy is often performed with a contact freezing technique to limit damage to the surrounding skin. Surgical forceps, a needle holder, or a hemostat are briefly dipped in liquid nitrogen and used to grasp and freeze the wart. Alternatively, cryotherapy can be performed with a cryospray or cotton bud techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since warts are infectious, patients should avoid deliberately manipulating warts on themselves or others. Using slippers or other footwear in public showers also may reduce the chance of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-warts-common-plantar-and-flat-warts/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>In addition, tools used for paring down warts (eg, nail file, pumice stone, etc) should not be reused on normal skin or nails and should not be shared with others. Hair-bearing skin with warts should be shaved with electric razors or not at all.</p><p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are available for the prevention of genital warts and HPV-related anogenital cancers. Given the challenges associated with treating cutaneous warts, the development of highly effective vaccines for the prevention of nonanogenital warts would be valuable.

Medical conditions such as atopic dermatitis and immunosuppression may increase risk for infection. Warts are usually transmitted via skin-to-skin contact. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major types of cutaneous warts include common warts (verruca vulgaris), plantar warts (verruca plantaris), and flat (plane) warts (verruca plana) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72086%7EDERM%2F51139%7EDERM%2F58825%7EDERM%2F70615%7EDERM%2F56924%7EPC%2F72268%7EDERM%2F53424%7EDERM%2F66188\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72086 graphicRef51139 graphicRef58825 graphicRef70615 graphicRef56924 graphicRef72268 graphicRef53424 graphicRef66188 \">picture 1A-H</a>). Additional terms used to further describe specific presentations are periungual warts, filiform warts, and mosaic warts. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many warts eventually spontaneously resolve; therefore, treatment is not always necessary. Common reasons for treatment include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Associated pain, discomfort, or functional impairment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patient concern for cosmesis or anxiety related to perceived social stigma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent wart(s)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immunosuppression (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with common or plantar warts, we suggest topical salicylic acid as first-line treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). Cryotherapy is an alternative first-line treatment; however, tolerance for associated pain and other side effects (eg, hypopigmentation) limits use in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H189033178\" class=\"local\">'First-line treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best approach to patients with refractory cutaneous warts is unclear. Topical immunotherapy with contact allergens, intralesional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, or topical or intralesional 5-fluorouracil may be useful for such patients. (See <a href=\"#H189034438\" class=\"local\">'Refractory warts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flat warts are usually treated with cryotherapy or topical agents such as tretinoin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, or 5-fluorouricil. Filiform warts are easily treated with cryotherapy or surgery.
