The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based on national mortality statistics from the United States, the prevalence of RA-ILD among patients with RA who died in the years 1988 to 2004 was approximately 10 percent in women and 6 percent in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Mortality rates due to ILD tend to be higher among women, although RA-ILD is generally more common among men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with early rheumatoid disease (joint symptoms &lt;2 years) who were surveyed with a range of investigations including pulmonary function tests, chest radiographs, and bronchoalveolar lavage, 21 of 36 patients (58 percent) had abnormal findings on at least one modality that were consistent with interstitial lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Case reports, series, and data from registries demonstrate a spectrum of pulmonary effects, including development of new interstitial disease, worsening of pre-existing ILD, and resolution of ILD. In an analysis of data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register, outcomes of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy were compared with DMARDS in patients with known RA-ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. After adjustment for age, sex, and other potential confounders, the adjusted mortality rate ratio (aMRR) was 0.81 (95% CI 0.38-1.73) for the anti-TNF-alpha cohort compared with the DMARD cohort, suggesting that anti-TNF-alpha agents did not increase mortality. However, RA-ILD was a more common cause of death in the anti-TNF cohort. At this stage it is not clear what the overall impact of biologic agents is on morbidity or mortality from ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) include more severe RA, male gender, older age, and cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14,27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,27,31</a>]. The principal <strong>preventable</strong> risk factor for ILD is cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/23,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,32</a>]. One study of 336 patients with RA found that those with a &gt;25 pack-year smoking history were significantly more likely to have radiographic evidence of ILD (odds ratio of 3.76; 95% CI 1.59-8.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Serologic studies may also identify patients at higher risk for ILD. In a case series of 356 patients with RA, high titers of rheumatoid factor (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;100&nbsp;IU/mL)</span> were associated with an increased risk of ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. While a higher titer of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) is also a risk factor for ILD, the presence of these antibodies more strongly predicts RA-associated airway disease, although specific subtypes of ACPA (Hsp90) may be important for interstitial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>It is thought that lung injury from cigarette smoking and other stimuli may contribute to the posttranslational modification (citrullination) of proteins, which then creates new epitopes and subsequent autoimmune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Higher levels of a variety of specific anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies and an expanded repertoire of these antibodies were present in patients with RA-ILD with lung function abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. RA-associated antibodies have been found in the sputum of patients at risk of RA well before joint disease developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Further research is needed to clarify the role of autoantibodies to citrullinated proteins in RA-ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Men are two to three times more likely to acquire ILD than women. While RA-ILD is often associated with erosive joint disease and post-dates the onset of joint symptoms by up to five years, it can occasionally precede joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The exact clinical presentation of RA-associated ILD depends on the underlying lung pathology. Most often, symptoms develop insidiously and include dyspnea on exertion and a nonproductive cough. Recognition of exertional dyspnea may be delayed due to the exercise limitation associated with joint disease. Patients with the pathologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), typically become symptomatic late in its course when widespread fibrosis is present. In contrast, a fulminant onset has been described in a few cases of rapidly fatal Hamman-Rich type syndrome, which has the pathologic pattern of acute interstitial pneumonia. Less common manifestations include fever and chest pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: Clinical manifestations and pathology&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute interstitial pneumonia (Hamman-Rich syndrome)&quot;</a>.). </p><p>Physical signs may be absent in early RA-ILD disease. Bibasilar crackles are present in over 75 percent, while signs of pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure may develop late in the course of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4,6,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,39</a>]. Clubbing is frequently noted in patients with the UIP pattern of RA-ILD (&gt;75 percent), but is much less common among those with other patterns of RA-ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) is usually suspected when a patient with RA develops dyspnea, cough, auscultatory crackles, or abnormalities on pulmonary function testing (PFTs) or chest radiograph. The evaluation of suspected RA-ILD typically includes a combination of laboratory testing, PFTs, imaging, and sometimes bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy. These tests are designed to characterize the presence, pattern, and severity of ILD, and also to exclude alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Diagnostic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A key component of the evaluation is determination of the type of ILD, as all of the histopathologic types of idiopathic interstitial lung disease can occur in the context of RA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68251\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68251 \">table 3</a>). Often the cause and type of ILD can be determined by the combination of clinical presentation, PFTs, and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). In a minority of cases, when these features are not typical for a given type of ILD and the patient is symptomatic, fit for surgery, and the biopsy would change the therapeutic approach (eg, avoid glucocorticoids in usual interstitial pneumonia [UIP] pattern), characterization of the ILD by lung biopsy is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>It is important to determine whether the patient is experiencing a first presentation of new interstitial disease, an exacerbation of previously unknown interstitial disease (usually UIP pattern), or one of these possibilities combined with a superimposed comorbid disease not directly due to RA. Investigations evaluating the various pulmonary manifestations of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] are designed to exclude the possibility that another lung disease or extra-pulmonary process is etiologic or coexistent, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection (especially in an immunosuppressed host)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-induced lung disease (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methotrexate-induced lung injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-induced-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-induced lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to inhalational agent (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A new or intercurrent ILD, such as acute interstitial pneumonitis or vasculitis, if symptoms are rapidly progressive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure, pulmonary embolism, cancer, or recurrent gastroesophageal aspiration</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260353502\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with (or without) RA who present with diffuse lung disease, we generally obtain a complete cell count and differential to look for leukocytosis (infection), leukopenia (immune suppression due to medication), or eosinophilia (possible drug reaction). A serum natriuretic peptide level is measured to screen for heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. Most patients have already had serologic testing for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), but full assessment of other autoantibodies should be performed, including antinuclear antibodies and anti-double stranded DNA antibodies, and also cryoglobulins to assess for coexistent rheumatic disease that may be contributory in the appropriate clinical setting, such as when purpura, Raynaud phenomenon, skin ulcers, or renal disease are present. </p><p>Rheumatoid factor may be present in high titer in patients with ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. ACPA positivity also correlates with the presence of RA-ILD and higher titers of ACPA may be associated with more severe ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31,35,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35,42,43</a>]. </p><p>While the sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) correlate with activity of RA joint disease, their role in the evaluation of lung disease is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete lung function testing (spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity) and pulse oximetry are obtained in all patients with suspected ILD to assess the pattern, severity, and progression of respiratory impairment. </p><p>Abnormalities associated with ILD include reductions in lung volumes and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO, also known as transfer factor), oxygen desaturation during exercise, and in late disease, resting hypoxemia.

Abnormalities in any single pulmonary function test are common in patients with RA. Thus, the diagnosis of clinically significant disease that warrants further monitoring or treatment is based upon the severity of impairment, rate of progression, and pattern of abnormalities identified by the investigations described above, rather than results of a single test. </p><p>As a way to guide treatment and monitoring strategies, a newer approach used in guidelines for idiopathic interstitial pneumonias has been to categorize the disease behavior as self-limited, reversible, stable, progressive, or irreversible, with or without the potential for long-term stabilization with therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F102358\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102358 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,13,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,72</a>].

This approach was addressed in a retrospective study of 144 patients with RA-UIP of whom 41 percent received immunosuppressive treatment due to poor initial lung function or ILD progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interstitial-lung-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

This study, while not randomized, would suggest that the outlook with treatment is better in RA-UIP than IPF or that the clinical diagnosis of RA-UIP is not accurate and may include patients with RA-NSIP, shown to have a better prognosis and response to treatment.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Clinical evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Diagnostic testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung biopsy is not needed unless clinical manifestations or HRCT findings are atypical for usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) (eg, rapid progression, fever, predominance of ground glass opacities over reticular). In patients who need a pathologic diagnosis, transbronchial biopsy usually provides insufficient tissue, so lung biopsy is typically performed by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) or thoracotomy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Lung biopsy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common histopathologic findings among patients with RA-ILD are those of UIP and nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP), with UIP and NSIP occurring in similar proportions. Other pathologic patterns include organizing pneumonitis, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, and diffuse alveolar damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68251\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68251 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Lung biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the uncertainty of the effect of traditional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic agents on the development and course of ILD in patients with RA, careful pretreatment assessment and subsequent monitoring are required, particularly in patients at high risk of ILD progression regardless of chosen treatment. However, concerns about the risk of drug-induced ILD progression should be balanced with the significant benefits of DMARDs and biologic agents in RA and the rarity of severe reactions to these drugs. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102323018\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main factors that influence the decision to treat RA-ILD are the patient's age, histopathologic subtype of ILD, severity and rapidity of progression of the disease, and the presence of coexisting disease. Treatment is more likely to be beneficial in patients of younger age (eg, &lt;60, rather than &gt;70) and in those with radiographic (or rarely biopsy) evidence of NSIP, organizing pneumonia (OP), or lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, rather than UIP. Deterioration of lung function over a period of one to three months strengthens the case for intervention. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have RA-ILD with features that favor a treatment response and no evidence of lung infection, we suggest initiating therapy with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or the equivalent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The usual dose of prednisone is 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (based on ideal body weight) as a single morning dose. A maximum oral dose of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> should not be exceeded. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of glucocorticoid therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who fail to respond to initial therapy with systemic glucocorticoids, a second immunosuppressive agent is typically added. Possible choices include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, depending on the severity of ILD (eg, cyclophosphamide for severe disease), familiarity of the treating physician with the individual agents, and the specific adverse effect profiles of the agents. (See <a href=\"#H260353849\" class=\"local\">'Failure to respond to systemic glucocorticoids'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with fulminant disease, after excluding infection and drug-induced lung toxicity, we suggest initial high-dose systemic glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 1 to 2 g per day given intravenously as a pulse or in divided doses for 3 to 5 days) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A second immunosuppressive agent is often added. (See <a href=\"#H114154667\" class=\"local\">'Fulminant disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After a clinical response, glucocorticoid therapy is gradually tapered over weeks to months. For patients who are unable to taper glucocorticoids to a level that does not cause intolerable adverse effects, we suggest adding a second immunosuppressive agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> are the preferred agents in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H260353992\" class=\"local\">'Inability to taper glucocorticoids or intolerance of adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring for an objective response to treatment is generally accomplished with clinical assessment, serial chest radiographs and testing of pulmonary function, including a six-minute walk test with measurement of pulse oxygen saturation, every one to three months. An important component of monitoring is surveillance for the adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapies and, when possible, implementation of preventive measures. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis of RA-ILD depends on the histopathologic subtype. Overall, the prognosis of RA-ILD appears slightly better than that seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, a diffusing capacity of less than 55 percent predicted is indicative of a poor prognosis.
