What is commonly described as the rotator cuff (RC) is a composite of muscles arising from the scapula and inserting onto the humerus. The rotator cuff is crucial to the function and stability of the glenohumeral joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Records of rotator cuff problems extend to the third century BC, when Hippocrates described the relationship of the tendons around the shoulder and noted the injuries associated with these tendons and the variability in their healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Rotator cuff disease remains a common cause of shoulder pain, accounting for over 4.5 million physician visits per year in the United States alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. While the radiographic imaging, physical therapy, and surgical techniques used to diagnose and manage rotator cuff tears have improved, the indications for surgery remain controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The management of rotator cuff tears will be reviewed here. The diagnosis of rotator cuff tears, diagnosis and management of rotator cuff tendinopathy, and the diagnostic approach to shoulder pain are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OPTIONS AND EVIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of rotator cuff tears depends upon several factors, including the duration of symptoms, shoulder dominance, the type of tear (partial versus full thickness), and patient factors such as age, comorbidities, and activity level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/5,7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7-11</a>]. Treatment options include surgical repair and nonoperative management. To date, few randomized trials have been performed that directly compare surgical and nonsurgical management of rotator cuff tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. Available trials have not demonstrated a clear benefit to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Well-controlled, prospective trials are needed to determine the relative risks and benefits of, and appropriate patients for, each approach.</p><p>Two systematic reviews of studies evaluating common interventions for the treatment of rotator cuff tears, including studies comparing different surgical approaches and others comparing surgery with physical therapy, found there was insufficient evidence to support one intervention over another and found the quality of many studies to be poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>]. Therefore, our approach to the management of rotator cuff tears, summarized in the accompanying algorithm, is necessarily based upon observational data, animal studies, evidence extrapolated from successful treatment of non-rotator cuff tendon tears, and our clinical experience (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78386\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78386 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/8,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL INDICATIONS FOR ROTATOR CUFF TEARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate indications for surgery to treat rotator cuff tears remain a source of debate among orthopedic surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In most cases, surgery is considered only when conservative measures fail. One important exception to this principle is an acute, full thickness traumatic tear of an otherwise normal rotator cuff in a healthy individual. Such an injury is usually treated with immediate surgery, since delay can lead to significant muscle atrophy, tendon retraction, and poorer surgical results. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute rotator cuff tears'</a> below.)</p><p>Another important exception involves an acute-on-chronic tear in which a patient with an existing partial rotator cuff tear suddenly loses the ability to abduct or flex the shoulder. These findings are consistent with the development of a full thickness tear and urgent surgical repair may be indicated, depending on associated factors, such as hand dominance, occupation, and patient age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>For all other rotator cuff tears, a trial of conservative treatment, consisting primarily of physical therapy, is generally indicated. Should conservative therapy fail to relieve pain or improve function, surgery may be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonoperative management of rotator cuff tears consists primarily of physical therapy. Few studies have assessed the effectiveness of nonsurgical management, and those that have been performed are limited in scope and methodology, making it difficult to draw specific conclusions about which patients are most amenable to physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/11,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22,23</a>]. Reported success rates range from 33 to 92 percent, reflecting the limitations of existing studies. Nonoperative treatment is likely to be more successful in younger patients (less than 60 years) with incomplete tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative treatment consists primarily of physical therapy emphasizing activity modification to minimize the risk of further injury; stretching of the shoulder capsule to restore flexibility and maintain motion; and strengthening of the periscapular, rotator cuff, and deltoid muscles to stabilize the glenohumeral joint and improve shoulder function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/23,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25-27</a>]. Programs are individually tailored to patient needs and expectations, but do not differ substantially for those with partial or complete tears.</p><p>For patients without ready access to physical therapists, home therapy programs are an important form of conservative management. Early on activity modifications, especially limiting overhead and reaching activities, can help to control symptoms.</p><p>Physical therapy progresses through three phases of recovery:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial phase emphasizes shoulder mobility. The goal is to recover a full range of motion equal and symmetrical with the contralateral shoulder (assuming the contralateral shoulder is uninjured). Stretching of the posterior and anterior joint capsule is emphasized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second phase emphasizes strength. Exercises with elastic bands and light weights are performed below shoulder height to increase the strength and endurance of the muscles involved in shoulder motion and stabilization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third phase emphasizes shoulder function. Exercises that stimulate joint reactivation, such as shoulder plyometrics, are performed to improve shoulder proprioception and coordination among the scapular stabilizers and glenohumeral structures.</p><p/><p>Many facets of the recovery program are adjusted according to the size and age of the rotator cuff tear, the amount of tendon retraction, the degree of muscle atrophy, and the patient's functional needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>]. As an example, the program for a young athlete with a small acute tear who plans a return to competition will differ significantly from one for an elderly patient with a chronic tear who hopes to perform basic activities of daily living.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6679846\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies suggest that a significant percentage of rotator cuff tears increase in size over time, and that large increases are often (but not always) associated with new or increased pain and weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/10,24,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,24,28-32</a>]. As rotator cuff tears enlarge, the risk of concomitant muscle atrophy and tendon retraction also increases, which in turn increases the difficulty and in some cases may preclude surgical repair. Therefore, we suggest regular reassessment of active patients who depend upon full shoulder function, are known to have a full thickness or high-grade partial thickness rotator cuff tear (whether symptomatic or asymptomatic) that does not yet cause significant disability, and who might benefit from surgical repair and are willing to undergo surgery. </p><p>Ideally, surveillance should include an assessment of shoulder strength (including abduction and flexion) and motion, and repeat imaging studies, and should be performed approximately every 6 to 12 months to monitor function and tear progression until surgery has been performed, or the patient is no longer a surgical candidate or no longer interested in surgical treatment. Surveillance imaging may be performed with ultrasound or MRI, although MRI may be prohibitively expensive for this purpose. In addition, we suggest that patients with asymptomatic rotator cuff tears be reevaluated in a timely manner should they develop any significant pain or decline in shoulder function or strength. </p><p>All potential surveillance candidates should be counseled about the risks associated with large partial and full thickness rotator cuff tears and the relative risks and benefits of nonsurgical and surgical management. When discussing treatment, clinicians should keep in mind the limited quality of the evidence about both nonsurgical and surgical outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of small studies of varying quality suggest that subacromial glucocorticoid injections provide some short term benefit in controlling pain from rotator cuff tears, but the effects tend to be short lived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Frequently, glucocorticoid injections are reserved for patients with severe pain from rotator cuff tears or tendinopathy, although other options, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, may be equally effective at controlling pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Glucocorticoid injections may have deleterious effects upon healthy tendons and repeat injections should be discouraged, except in cases where surgery is not possible because of poor patient health or severe, chronic rotator cuff tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>]. The use of more than four injections is associated with decreased durability in surgically repaired tendons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Subacromial injection techniques vary according to physician experience and preference, and include anterior, lateral, and posterior approaches. Clinicians using the anterior approach must avoid injecting the biceps tendon, which may result in biceps tendon tear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other nonsurgical treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of other treatment modalities as they pertain to rotator cuff tears, such as ultrasound, topical agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, glucocorticoid iontophoresis, massage, acupuncture, shock-wave therapy, and viscosupplement injections, are yet unclear and require further study. The use of these treatments for rotator cuff tendinopathy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PARTIAL THICKNESS ROTATOR CUFF TEARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most rotator cuff tears start as partial undersurface (ie, on the articular side) tears of the supraspinatus tendon. They may result from secondary impingement syndrome. Secondary impingement of the rotator cuff on the acromion occurs when a deficient rotator cuff fails to center the humeral head on the glenoid during active abduction and forward flexion of the shoulder. Degeneration of muscles and tendons, overload of the muscle tendon unit, and weakness of the periscapular muscles may also contribute to rotator cuff tears. Partial cuff tears can progress to full thickness tears. The pathophysiology and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-impingement-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder impingement syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Partial thickness rotator cuff tears are often difficult to detect. They may cause pain with little or no loss of function. In partial thickness tears a portion of the tendon remains intact preventing the tendon from retracting and allowing the muscle tendon unit to function, thereby preventing muscle atrophy. When partial tears cause pain or weakness, the initial treatment consists of analgesics, physical therapy that emphasizes improving range of motion and strength, and avoidance of activities that exacerbate symptoms, such as those involving overhead and reaching motions. </p><p>The factors most responsible for increasing the size of partial rotator cuff tears tear are not well understood. In most cases, increases in tear size are accompanied by greater pain and a decline in function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/28,29,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,38,39</a>]. Larger tears are more likely to cause clinically significant symptoms than smaller tears.</p><p>Surgical repair may be needed to control pain and preserve function in patients with chronic partial tears that are recalcitrant to conservative treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Recalcitrant cases are generally defined by a failure to respond to up to three to six months of properly performed physical therapy and one or two glucocorticoid injections. Older patients may need longer treatment. </p><p>When operative treatment is indicated, partial thickness rotator cuff tears are managed with either formal repair or arthroscopic debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/21,40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,40-45</a>]. The tear is evaluated during surgery. If the tear comprises less than 50 percent of the tendon's thickness, surgery consists of light debridement with or without a subacromial decompression. Studies have failed to demonstrate a clear benefit from the addition of subacromial decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. If the tear involves more than 50 percent of the rotator cuff insertion site or is over 2 cm in diameter, arthroscopic repair is often performed, as opposed to debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> below.)</p><p>Although tear thickness is the primary determinant of surgical management, a number of other factors, such as age, concomitant pathologies, activity level, and functional disability, are also important. For instance, the relatively young patient experiencing significant weakness or functional disability may benefit from repair of a tear less than 50 percent thickness, but the overhead athlete experiencing pain with little weakness may have superior outcomes with debridement despite a near full thickness tear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE ROTATOR CUFF TEARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend immediate surgical repair in cases of acute, full thickness rotator cuff tears in otherwise healthy individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78386\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78386 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/17,18,20,46-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,20,46-51</a>]. Delayed repair of such tears can result in significant muscle atrophy with tendon degeneration and retraction, and compromised surgical results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/9,18,19,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18,19,49-51</a>]. </p><p>Fatty infiltration of muscle tissue develops over a period of months to years following a rotator cuff tear; the older the patient the more quickly fatty infiltration occurs, and resulting declines in function may be irreversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. More extensive infiltration is associated with worse surgical outcomes.</p><p>We suggest that surgical repair be performed within six weeks of the injury. Early repair is supported by several observational studies, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 74 patients with rotator cuff tears treated operatively, surgeons noted that signs of irreversible muscle damage (eg, fatty degeneration) associated with delays between injury and repair correlated with greater difficulty performing surgery and poorer functional outcomes (eg, decreased motion and strength) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excellent or good outcomes, using the UCLA shoulder function scale, were achieved in 24 of 26 patients who sustained an acute full thickness rotator cuff tear and were treated with operative repair within three weeks of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p>As noted above, complete tendon tears can lead to irreversible muscle degeneration. Therefore, expeditious surgery may also be helpful in cases of acute-on-chronic rotator cuff tears where the patient suddenly loses the ability to actively abduct or flex the shoulder. This condition is referred to as pseudoparalysis and presumably results from exacerbation of the preexisting tear.</p><p>Nonoperative management is preferred for the initial treatment of acute rotator cuff tears in elderly patients, patients with major comorbidities that increase the risk of surgery, and noncompliant patients. Patients with limited functional demands often tolerate rotator cuff tears without major problems. Even patients with moderately symptomatic massive cuff tears have been found to maintain satisfactory function for at least four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Pushing, pulling, and lifting with the elbows kept close to the side is usually well tolerated even with significant tears, allowing most patients to perform basic activities and to transfer, for example, from sitting to standing, comfortably. Adequate pain control can usually be achieved with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, cryotherapy, and glucocorticoid injections, when indicated. Care should be taken not to exceed a total of four injections in patients who may require surgery. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid injection'</a> above.)</p><p>Surgery may be necessary in patients whose symptoms and function fail to improve despite at least six weeks of appropriate physical therapy and two glucocorticoid injections. Patients who refuse surgery should be counseled that significant pathologic changes may occur in the musculotendinous unit that may become irreversible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC, SYMPTOMATIC ROTATOR CUFF TEARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of patients with chronic, symptomatic rotator cuff tears is nonoperative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78386\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78386 \">algorithm 1</a>). Conservative treatment for such tears generally consists of a minimum of six weeks of physical therapy and may include one or two glucocorticoid injections. A rigorous attempt at conservative management should be completed before surgery is considered.</p><p>Surgical outcomes depend upon a number of factors including age (better results are reported in patients under 60), the age of the tear, the size of the tear (larger tears have higher reinjury rates), and the degree of muscle atrophy and tendon retraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/9,17-20,46-48,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17-20,46-48,54,55</a>]. The surgeon should discuss these factors and the likelihood of an acceptable outcome with the patient. With chronic tears, surgery involving an attempt at rotator cuff repair and possible subacromial decompression may reduce pain but fail to improve function, especially in cases with moderate to severe muscle atrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61710288\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical repair of the rotator cuff can be performed arthroscopically or open. Open procedures involve either a standard or a &quot;mini-open&quot; technique. Studies assessing these three approaches are limited in size and methodology and provide little guidance for determining the best method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Furthermore, improvements in arthroscopic technique developed subsequent to the majority of these studies make many of their conclusions obsolete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-59</a>]. We believe that in experienced hands arthroscopic repair is preferable because of decreased morbidity and comparable functional outcomes. The advantages of arthroscopic repair can be lost if a technically difficult repair is performed by an inexperienced arthroscopist.</p><p>Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has steadily gained popularity. Its advantages include the ability to see the entire joint including the rotator cuff, decreased loss of motion, preservation of the deltoid muscle, lower infection rates, less postoperative pain, shorter delays until physical therapy, and shorter hospital stays (most arthroscopies are performed as day surgeries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/7,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,60</a>]. Although morbidity is low, disadvantages do exist. These include increased cost, especially when implants such as suture anchors are used, and increased operative times with novice arthroscopists.</p><p>So-called &quot;mini-open&quot; rotator cuff repair became popular in the 1990s and remains an acceptable approach for surgeons who are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with arthroscopic surgical techniques. This approach involves a substantially smaller incision and exposure than that of a standard open approach. The results achieved using mini-open cuff repair with arthroscopic subacromial decompression appear equal to those achieved with open reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Disadvantages include difficulty with surgical exposure, increased risk of axillary nerve injury, and increased postoperative pain.</p><p>Formal open surgical repair of the rotator cuff is an acceptable surgical procedure but is rarely employed due to the availability of the less invasive surgical techniques described above. Disadvantages include violation of the deltoid muscle (which in a rotator cuff-deficient shoulder may be the glenohumeral joint's only abductor and forward flexor), and difficulty achieving exposure of the entire rotator cuff, biceps attachment, and subscapularis tendon. Complications can include deltoid detachment, higher infection rates, axillary nerve injury, glenohumeral joint stiffness, and increased postoperative pain.</p><p>With all three techniques, rerupture of the rotator cuff can occur. The risk of rerupture is related to the size and age of the tear, age of the patient, quality of the repair, degree of muscle and tendon atrophy, and nicotine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Regardless of the surgical technique performed, the basic tenets of rotator cuff repair remain unchanged: provide a secure repair of the rotator cuff tendon over a large tendon-bone contact area at the original cuff attachment site on the humerus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61710318\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuncts to surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Researchers continue to study cell-based, adjunct treatments, such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), to aid healing following rotator cuff surgery. Although the use of PRP to augment cuff repair has shown promise in some animal and in vitro studies, results in human clinical trials have not consistently shown positive outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Multiple randomized trials have reported no clear improvement in pain, lasting functional outcomes, or re-tear rates when PRP is used concomitantly with surgical cuff repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/64-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-70</a>]. Several observational studies report improved healing with the use of MSCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>], but robust randomized trials are needed to demonstrate effectiveness. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND RETURN TO WORK OR SPORTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative rehabilitation protocols vary depending upon the extent of the injury and repair, the quality of the tissue, and the surgeon's preference. Most patients are instructed to use an abduction brace for six weeks to relieve stress on the repair and to reduce the chances of damaging it, for example, should the patient fall. Patients with smaller tears and good tissue may be able to begin the stages of rehabilitation (eg, passive motion exercises, active motion without resistance, active motion with light resistance) earlier than patients with more complex injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/73-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-77</a>]. </p><p>Immediate use of the elbow, wrist, and hand when sitting may be allowed for simple daily activities, such as holding a phone, using eating utensils, showering, and perhaps driving a car. The patient MUST keep the elbow on the side of the affected shoulder against his or her side at all times when the abduction brace is not in place.</p><p>At three months, most patients are allowed to use the shoulder for light activities above shoulder height. At six months, more vigorous activities are permitted. Patients should be warned that an extended period of time may be needed to regain strength and stamina in the affected shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]. Patients may continue to improve their shoulder strength for up to two years postoperatively.</p><p>Return to work is contingent upon the patient's job activities and can range from one week in sedentary work to six months for jobs involving heavy overhead lifting or strenuous overhead sports. Physical therapy programs often incorporate activities that simulate the patient's work for those whose work places heavy demands upon the shoulder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &ldquo;patient info&rdquo; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Rotator cuff injury (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond the Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinitis-and-tear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rotator cuff tendinitis and tear (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial thickness rotator cuff tears are often difficult to detect. They may cause pain with little or no loss of function. For symptomatic partial tears, we suggest that the initial treatment consist of activity modification, analgesics, and physical therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Surgical repair may be needed in patients with chronic partial tears that do not improve with nonoperative treatment. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Partial thickness rotator cuff tears'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of acute rotator cuff tears varies with the clinical scenario (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78386\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78386 \">algorithm 1</a>). We recommend immediate surgical repair for acute, full thickness rotator cuff tears in otherwise healthy individuals (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Expeditious surgery may also be helpful in cases of acute-on-chronic rotator cuff tears where the patient suddenly loses the ability to actively abduct or flex the shoulder. We suggest that such patients be urgently referred to an orthopedic surgeon. We suggest nonoperative management for the initial treatment of acute rotator cuff tears in elderly patients, patients with major comorbidities, and noncompliant patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute rotator cuff tears'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that the initial care of symptomatic chronic rotator cuff tears be nonoperative (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Such care generally consists of a minimum of six weeks of physical therapy and may include one or two glucocorticoid injections. A rigorous attempt at conservative management should be completed before surgery is considered. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Chronic, symptomatic rotator cuff tears'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conservative treatment consists primarily of physical therapy emphasizing activity modification; stretching of the shoulder capsule to restore flexibility and maintain motion; and strengthening of the periscapular, rotator cuff, and deltoid muscles. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacromial glucocorticoid injections may provide some short term benefit in controlling pain from rotator cuff tears. However, effects tend to be short lived and glucocorticoids may have deleterious effects upon healthy tendons. One or two injections are acceptable in patients with severe pain that is refractory to oral medications. We suggest that repeated injections of glucocorticoids be avoided, except in cases where surgery is not possible (eg, patient with severe comorbidities precluding surgery) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid injection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</strong> &mdash; The authors would like to acknowledge William K Conaway, BA, who graciously assisted in manuscript preparation.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Matsen, FA III, Arntz, CT.
