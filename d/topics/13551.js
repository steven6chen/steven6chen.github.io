Early identification and prompt symptomatic treatment are vital to avoid possible sequelae, including rhabdomyolysis and seizures.</p><p>PCP is a synthetic arylcycloalkylamine discovered in 1926 and subsequently developed as Sernyl in the 1950s for use as a nonnarcotic anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Sernyl exerted a calming effect at low anesthetic doses and induced cataplexy at higher doses, but it did not markedly suppress blood pressure or respiration. The use of Sernyl as a dissociative anesthetic was discontinued due to postoperative dysphoria and hallucinations, and by 1967 was limited to veterinary use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In April of 1979, all legal manufacturing of PCP in the United States was terminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the early 1970s a laboratory investigation of PCP derivatives led to the discovery of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>. Ketamine is 5 to 10 percent as potent as Sernyl and is now used clinically to induce dissociative anesthesia. Ketamine is also abused as a recreational drug.</p><p>PCP's popularity as a drug of abuse peaked in the 1970s. During the late 1970s, one urban psychiatric hospital in the US found that 63 of 145 consecutive patients sampled over a 48-hour period tested positive for PCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Since that time, hospital visits and poison center calls related to PCP use have declined, although it remains an important drug of abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The basic pharmacology, clinical manifestations, and management of PCP intoxication in adults will be reviewed here. The management of PCP poisoning in children, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> poisoning, and other issues related to the management of the poisoned patient are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ketamine poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCP, or 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl) piperidine hydrochloride, is a dissociative anesthetic. It is synthesized from piperidine and cyclohexanone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is a weak base with a pKa of 8.6 and is soluble in water and ethanol&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>PCP is a stable white solid with a bitter taste. It is manufactured in many forms for recreational use, including powder, crystal, liquid, and tablets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It has been sprinkled on leaves for ingestion, and there are reports of it being combined with embalming fluid to enable the drug's uniform distribution in cigarettes (often referred to as &ldquo;wet&rdquo;, &ldquo;illy&rdquo;, or &ldquo;fry&rdquo;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Concentrations of the drug vary in PCP tablets (1 to 6 mg) and PCP-laced marijuana (1 to 10 mg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>PCP has a number of analogs that may also be abused, including PHP (rolicyclidine, phenylcyclohexylpyrrolidine), PCE (N-ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine), TCP (1-[1-(2-thienyl) cyclohexyl] piperidine), and PCC (1-piperidinocyclohexane-carbonitrile). PCC is commonly found in street grade PCP. PCC has the potential for increased toxicity due to the release of hydrogen cyanide when smoked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], although acute cyanide toxicity is unlikely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There have been recent reports of less well-regulated designer drugs related to PCP with similar toxicity profiles including: methoxphenidine (a diarylethylamine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and gacyclidine (a derivative of PCP or TCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>The dose of PCP varies depending upon the amount of active drug and the route. In general, symptoms first appear at 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. Alteration of body image has been reported at 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> and 10 mg has been reported to cause catatonic stupor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>PCP is a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It also stimulates sigma receptors and blocks the reuptake of biogenic amines. Stimulation of alpha adrenergic receptors is thought to be responsible for its sympathomimetic effects and cerebral vasospasm.</p><p>PCP has three primary sites of action in the central nervous system:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex &ndash; PCP has great affinity for NMDA receptor complexes in the hippocampus, neocortex, basal ganglia, and limbic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. NMDA antagonism at these sites produces acute psychosis that mimics schizophrenia in humans and leads to excess excitatory neurotransmitter release (eg, glutamate, glycine, aspartate) that can cause agitation and seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dopamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>, and serotonin reuptake complex &ndash; PCP inhibits reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This action contributes to the adrenergic and dopaminergic effects of PCP intoxication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sigma receptor complex &ndash; PCP binding to the sigma receptor may explain, in part, the psychotic, anticholinergic, and movement abnormalities seen with intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absorption, peak serum concentration, and duration of effect vary with the route of PCP use. A retrospective study of 1000 patients found smoking to be the most common route (72 percent), usually via laced cigarettes or marijuana, followed by insufflation (13 percent), ingestion (12 percent), and intravenous (IV) injection (1.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Smoking, insufflation, and IV or intramuscular routes produce symptoms within two to five minutes, while oral ingestion produces symptoms in 30 to 60 minutes.</p><p>Smoking causes a rapid initial peak in plasma concentrations at five minutes and a second peak at 22 minutes. The second peak may be related to delayed absorption from the lungs. The mean half-life after smoking (24 hours) is similar to the IV route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The peak effect following ingestion is approximately 90 minutes. The duration of action (one to three hours) is similar to the IV route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. PCP may undergo enterogastric recycling following oral doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although not well absorbed in the stomach, PCP is actively secreted into the gastric fluid, where concentrations can reach 50 times that of the serum. It is then absorbed in the more alkaline small intestines.</p><p>IV injection of PCP produces an immediate effect. Following IV injection, the duration of action is one to two hours, despite the long terminal half-life (21 hours).</p><p>PCP has a large volume of distribution (6.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span> and is 65 percent protein bound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The drug's high lipid solubility accounts for the ease with which it crosses the blood brain barrier and enters adipose tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels are reported to be four times serum levels due to the slightly more acidic pH of the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>PCP displays first order kinetics with a half-life of 7 to 26 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Elimination of PCP is principally by hepatic metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is rapidly metabolized in the liver to hydroxylated derivatives and excreted in the urine primarily as a mono-4-hydroxypiperidine conjugate. These metabolites are thought to have minimal pharmacologic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Approximately 5 to 10 percent is excreted unchanged in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A lower urine pH increases renal clearance, but this contributes little to overall elimination and may be dangerous. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Enhanced elimination'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES OF OVERDOSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication is made based upon the history and clinical evaluation. Unfortunately, a clear history is often unavailable as patients are frequently alone and exhibit alterations in mental status. Sometimes friends or emergency medical services personnel provide useful details. It can be helpful to know the street names for PCP, which include angel dust, embalming fluid, killer weed, peace pill, horse tranquilizer, and hog [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Severe poisoning can occur if a patient ingests large amounts of poorly packaged drug to avoid discovery by the authorities (body stuffing) or a break occurs in a container of concentrated drug that the patient has swallowed for the purpose of illicit transport (body packing). Coingestants are common with PCP use and may alter the clinical presentation or treatment. Marijuana cigarettes sometimes contain PCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internal-concealment-of-drugs-of-abuse-body-packing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internal concealment of drugs of abuse (body packing)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">General findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination should begin with an assessment of the patient's airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status. Although uncommon, patients with large PCP ingestions may present with profound CNS and respiratory depression requiring immediate endotracheal intubation. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>PCP intoxication can produce a wide range of vital signs and physical findings depending upon the amount ingested, the route of administration, patient susceptibility, and the presence of coingestants (in one case series, 54 percent took another substance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Adrenergic stimulation is typical, but patients may exhibit central nervous system (CNS) stimulation or depression. Most patients are alert but experience hallucinations and demonstrate odd behavior and agitation similar to acute psychosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients may unexpectedly progress to coma, which may be prolonged. Because of this unpredictability, vital signs and clinical assessment should be repeated often until the patient has stabilized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Vital signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure elevation is reported in 32 to 57 percent of patients with PCP intoxication. Systolic blood pressure correlates with elevated plasma drug concentrations and is significantly higher than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. According to a large retrospective case series, hypertension resolves in less than four hours in 62 percent of cases but persists over 24 hours in 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in association with uncontrolled hypertension has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>Tachycardia occurs in 30 to 43 percent of patients with a positive urine PCP test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,26</a>]. In a case control study, tachycardia was more common in patients with confirmed PCP intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients may be hyperthermic (2.6 to 4 percent) or hypothermic (6.4 percent) depending upon the degree of psychomotor agitation and environmental conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuropsychiatric findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CNS signs and symptoms are common and vary widely. Patients may be alert with bizarre behavior, agitated or violent, or sedated and bordering on comatose. Furthermore, these symptoms may wax and wane over time. In case series, 46 to 52 percent of patients were alert and oriented upon arrival to the hospital, but most are alert and awake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25</a>].</p><p>Psychomotor agitation occurs often, with observational data suggesting a rate between 34 and 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,26</a>]. Violence has been reported in 13 to 35 percent of patients and is more common in single drug exposures. According to a case series of 1000 confirmed PCP-intoxicated patients, 13 percent were involved in an altercation, of which 33 percent involved a gun or knife used to threaten others and 22 percent involved self-inflicted wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Such violent behavior may be associated with delusions of super-human strength and diminished pain perception. Caregivers should be cautious when caring for agitated patients with possible PCP intoxication.</p><p>In the same case series, psychomotor symptoms related to PCP intoxication were grouped into major and minor patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Major symptoms, including acute brain syndrome (defined below), psychosis, catatonia, and coma, were associated with a more severe course and poorer outcomes. Complications included trauma (16 percent of patients), rhabdomyolysis (2.2 percent), and aspiration pneumonia (1 percent). Minor symptoms included lethargy or stupor and combinations of bizarre behavior, violence, agitation, and euphoria in patients who were otherwise alert and oriented. Minor symptoms were usually associated with a less severe clinical course.</p><p>Acute brain syndrome, defined as disorientation combined with confusion, lack of judgment, inappropriate affect, or loss of memory, was the most common major symptom, reported in 37 percent of patients in one case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Psychosis was reported in 16.6 percent of patients in the aforementioned series, including 63 percent of patients without coingestants. A smaller case series reported a high rate of auditory hallucinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Visual and tactile hallucinations can also occur. Full recovery from psychosis may take weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the case series cited above, catatonia was found in 11.7 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In another series, approximately 6 percent of patients were reported to be wandering in public and 56 percent of them had disrobed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Catatonia is typically of short duration with 85 percent of cases resolving by 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Lethargy or stupor was reported in 3.8 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Coma was reported in 11 percent of patients, with the duration of unconsciousness ranging from 30 minutes to seven days. A smaller case series reported that 50 percent of patients developed a decreased level of consciousness at some time during their clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Horizontal, vertical, or rotatory nystagmus is common with reported rates ranging from 57 to 89 percent of cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74834\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74834 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27</a>]. Other potential CNS effects include dystonic reactions, tardive dyskinesia, and athetosis, but these are rare. Symptoms such as ataxia, dysarthria, nausea, and vomiting may also occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatalities in the setting of PCP intoxication are uncommon and most are secondary to trauma. Other causes include hyperthermia, respiratory arrest, and intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p>Treating clinicians should be aware of the potential for multiple serious complications in patients with PCP intoxication.

In another case series, 40 percent of patients with PCP-associated rhabdomyolysis (defined as myoglobinuria and a creatine phosphokinase concentration above 16,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L)</span> developed acute renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Seizures occur infrequently, with estimates ranging from 2.6 to 6 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/4,10,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,33</a>]. Status epilepticus has been reported.</p><p>Prolonged psychiatric illness may stem from an underlying condition or drug effect. Psychiatric evaluation should be obtained after a period of observation confirms the patient is medically stable. A retrospective review performed at a psychiatric facility found that 20 patients with new-onset PCP-induced psychosis needed shorter hospitalizations (average 4.8 days; range 1 to 9) compared with 20 patients with new-onset functional psychosis (13.9 days; range 3 to 41) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Physical restraints may be necessary initially and several staff members are often needed to control patients agitated from PCP. Thereafter, chemical sedation is essential to control agitation, prevent or treat hyperthermia, perform a thorough physical examination, and obtain necessary studies.</p><p>Little evidence exists to guide the use of sedatives in the management of PCP intoxication. Based upon observational reports and broad clinical experience, we believe benzodiazepines are the preferred agents to achieve chemical sedation.</p><p>We treat severely agitated patients immediately with intravenous (IV) benzodiazepines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> 4 mg IV or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 5 to 10 mg IV).

These doses may be repeated. Some clinicians prefer to avoid butyrophenones because they are purported to lower the seizure threshold and impair heat dissipation in hyperthermic patients. However, there are no high quality studies in humans to support such claims.</p><p>Although IV administration of sedatives and antipsychotics is strongly preferred in severely intoxicated patients, intramuscular (IM) injection may be used if IV access is unavailable.

PCP intoxication often leads to bizarre behavior, hallucinations, delusions of physical prowess, and a diminished perception of pain. As a result, PCP abuse is often associated with trauma. A large case series reported injuries in 13 percent of patients, 22 percent of which were self-inflicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Other major potential complications of PCP intoxication include hyperthermia, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and hypertension. Hyperthermia typically improves with adequate sedation, but external cooling and, in a small number of severe refractory cases, even paralysis and mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Hypertension is typically transient and rarely requires pharmacologic intervention beyond sedation. Refractory hypertension can be treated with short acting agents such as nitroglycerine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> that can be titrated to effect. Cardiac monitoring and frequent reexamination are essential in patients with any significant complication.

Clinical trials in humans are needed before this approach can be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Decontamination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients survive PCP intoxication uneventfully with supportive care; decontamination is generally unnecessary in isolated ingestions. However, decontamination with activated charcoal (AC) may be useful if a massive ingestion or a potentially dangerous coingestant is present and treatment is started within one hour of ingestion. Patients who ingest large amounts of PCP to avoid police detection (body stuffers) or to transport drug for distribution (body packers) may sustain massive ingestions. Any potential benefit from AC must be weighed against the risk of aspiration, especially given the potential for altered mental status and seizures with severe PCP intoxication. AC is given in a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> (maximum 50 g).</p><p>We do NOT typically use multidose activated charcoal (MDAC) in patients with PCP intoxication. MDAC provides a theoretical benefit because of the extensive enterohepatic recirculation of PCP. Dogs treated with AC following oral doses of PCP demonstrated decreased duration of anesthesia, seizures, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Giving rats activated charcoal following an oral dose of PCP significantly elevated the lethal dose (LD50) of PCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, there is no evidence of clinical benefit in humans, and the potential for aspiration exists whenever AC is given.</p><p>We do NOT suggest the use of nasogastric suction in patients with PCP intoxication. Nasogastric suction is theoretically beneficial when performed soon after ingestion due to the high concentration of PCP in the stomach's acidic environment. However, it has no proven benefit and may cause electrolyte abnormalities, aspiration, and unwanted difficulty in agitated patients.</p><p>Whole bowel irrigation is NOT routinely recommended. It should only be used in patients who have ingested potentially lethal amounts of PCP, as may occur with body stuffers or body packers.

Moreover, acidification increases the potential for systemic acidosis, worsening rhabdomyolysis and renal damage, and precipitation of uric acid leading to nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>In a study of dogs loaded with 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of PCP, charcoal hemoperfusion failed to reduce the number of seizures, duration of coma, or tissue concentration compared with control animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Only 2 percent of the parent compound was recovered. The authors concluded that PCP's high volume of distribution, high lipid solubility, and low plasma concentration make removal by hemoperfusion ineffective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">DISPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the variable course of PCP toxicity, even patients without severe symptoms or complications benefit from some period of observation. Patients presenting early following an ingestion may be asymptomatic initially but should be observed for at least six hours. Patients with mild symptoms presenting a few hours after the onset of intoxication generally recover within several hours. Such patients may be discharged provided the effects of intoxication have resolved and the patient remains symptom-free during a brief (one to two hours) period of observation. In a case series of 184 patients, 83 percent went home, 8 percent were admitted, and the rest were transferred to a crisis center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/phencyclidine-pcp-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Any patient with significant complications (eg, rhabdomyolysis, coma, status epilepticus) or severe symptoms (eg, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperthermia) should be admitted to an intensive care setting. Patients with less severe but persistent symptoms should be admitted to an appropriate ward for further monitoring and treatment.</p><p>Psychiatric evaluation should be obtained where appropriate, once medical problems have been addressed. Chronic abusers may benefit from treatment for substance abuse.
