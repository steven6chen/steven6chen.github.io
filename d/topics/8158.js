This United States Public Health Service (USPHS)-mandated notification, developed in conjunction with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), may have come as a surprise to community physicians who were faced with the task of locating patients, informing them about the possible exposure, providing appropriate testing and counseling, and possibly evaluating or treating those who were found to be HCV positive, in a process referred to as &quot;lookback.&quot;</p><p>Strictly speaking, lookback is the process through which patients who may have received pathogen-infected blood are identified by tracing a suspect donor's previous donations to those recipients for the purpose of testing, evaluation, and providing treatment as indicated. Transfusion recipients who are the focus of HCV lookback are those who have been transfused with blood from a now HCV-confirmed positive donor who either had not been previously tested for HCV or who was negative for HCV at the time of previous donations; or from a donor who is now HCV test reactive, but results cannot be confirmed, or further testing cannot performed using an assay that meets FDA specifications. Lookback is required for other pathogens such as HIV, but hepatitis C was unique because of the United States federal government's prescriptive requirements for patient notification that involve the physician of record. </p><p>Recognizing that involvement in an HCV lookback process is an infrequent and possibly new experience for many practitioners, the purpose of this discussion is to review the rationale for HCV lookback, define lookback, outline regulatory expectations, and provide physicians in the United States with resources that can make the patient notification process less onerous. Similar programs exist in other countries. </p><p>Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of HCV infection in the general population is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE HCV EPIDEMIC AND THE HISTORY OF HCV LOOKBACK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that up to four million Americans are infected with HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The majority of these individuals have been exposed to the virus through the sharing of needles used in injection drug use, and a smaller percentage through sexual contact, perinatally, or occupationally. Approximately one-third of infected people do not identifiably fall into these risk categories, but have a history of behavior, such as multiple sex partners, that places them at higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Transfusion transmission once accounted for 0.5 to 10 percent of HCV infections, but due to the use of increasingly sensitive blood donor screening assays, including nucleic acid testing (NAT), the HCV transfusion transmission risk is approximately 1 per 1.2 million units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, concerns remain within the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Public Health Service (USPHS) that there is a small population of individuals who are still unaware of possible exposure to HCV through transfusion. </p><p>In 1997, the USPHS, which oversees the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announced its intention to address the HCV epidemic. In response, the CDC launched a national prevention and control plan that included public education and other efforts to reach at-risk populations, an educational campaign directed at healthcare providers, and community-based prevention programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Individuals who contracted HCV through transfusion were viewed as comprising a special subset of the &quot;at-risk&quot; population. Although it is recognized that the more general CDC outreach program may have identified some who acquired HCV through transfusion, the USPHS authorized the FDA to establish a &quot;targeted lookback&quot; program specifically to reach transfusion recipients.</p><p>Separately, the CDC also expanded recommendations for HCV screening in the general population, due to a higher-than-expected prevalence of HCV in a cohort of adults along with the potential benefits of improved HCV therapy. This increased screening has the potential to identify additional patients with transfusion-transmitted HCV for whom lookback information could be relevant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to accomplishing the targeted HCV lookback program was described in the FDA's 1998 &quot;Guidance for Industry&quot; that required community blood banks and healthcare providers to take clearly defined actions that would make it possible to identify specific individuals who may have received contaminated blood. Responsibility for notifying potentially exposed patients was assigned primarily to the physician of record who had to make at least three attempts to contact the recipient and conduct other required notification activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Under the FDA's 1998 and 2007 recommendations, the blood center that detects a donor's HCV infection is required to provide the acquiring hospital with a list of the donor's previous units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The hospital transfusion service is required to search its records to determine who received the units and to notify the &quot;recipient's physician of record,&quot; or attempt to contact the patient directly. (Although the FDA uses the words &quot;recommendation&quot; and &quot;guidance&quot; in the context of HCV lookback, participation is not considered to be optional.)</p><p>The 2007 FDA requirements requiring HCV lookback and &quot;reasonable&quot; recipient notification attempts remain in effect, but they do not explicitly state how many attempts must be made to notify the recipient. Updated information in the May 2015 FDA Federal Register instructs that if the recipient is a minor, is judged incompetent by State law, or has a legal representative, the physician of record or transfusion service must notify the parent or legal representative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Practically speaking, notification efforts by hospital transfusion services likely vary, and in many cases the responsibility to identify recipients in these categories would fall on the physician of record. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL RATIONALE FOR HCV LOOKBACK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the risk of acquiring HCV from transfusion is now very low, early CDC estimates that 300,000 individuals in the United States had HCV as a result of blood transfusion spurred government action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An August 1997 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) memorandum, recapitulating a Congressional report on Government Reform and Oversight, stated that HHS should implement actions to notify previously transfused individuals &quot;so that they might seek diagnosis and treatment&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The lookback experience of Canadian and European blood centers had already demonstrated that the process was successful in finding patients who contracted HCV from transfusions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61796 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].</p><p>The concern over the need for diagnosis is derived from the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronicity occurs in 85 percent of those exposed; cirrhosis develops, usually insidiously, in approximately 50 percent of such patients after a mean time of 20 to 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Only one-third of patients exhibit symptoms, and most of these are constitutional in nature; icterus is rare and even liver function test abnormalities, such as elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations, do not occur with reliable frequency. Thus, overt symptoms that normally would alert a physician or compel most patients to seek medical care are conspicuously absent in HCV-infected persons. As a result, hepatic injury can progress undetected for decades.</p><p>Concerns about the serious sequelae of HCV infection and increasing optimism that many individuals may benefit from antiviral therapy have prompted the government to institute this patient identification and notification program.

If clarification or additional information about the lookback investigation is needed, the physician should contact the transfusion service staff or medical director. If the physician wants additional details about the donor's test results or known risks, and the transfusion service is unaware of or unable to provide more detail, the physician may seek consultation with the medical director of the blood center that issued the suspect unit. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Locating the patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient is no longer on record or if records are not available, an internet search or search of public records available on the internet, usually for a fee, may facilitate the process of locating the patient. Some companies provide specialty services for a fee for locating people. &#160;</p><p>Several Web sites that access the Social Security Death Index contain death record information. These sites, which include www.familytreemaker.com and www.ancestry.com, may be of use if it is believed that the person may have died. The regional public health department is another potential resource. Finally, it may be helpful to engage the assistance of the hospital transfusion service or accounting department; the latter probably subscribes to at least one of the major search services.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests for HCV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and public health departments provide updated recommendations for HCV testing.

However, among all patients, the percentage of HCV infections deemed attributable to transfusion was in the range of 4 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In a large Canadian lookback program which involved attempts to notify over 100,000 individuals who received blood between 1982 and 1990, 4.1 percent of the approximately 51,000 recipients tested were HCV positive; newly diagnosed cases, presumed due to transfusion, represented 42 to 58 percent of the total [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In a lookback targeted at all 1980 to 1992 blood recipients from an Alaskan medical center, approximately 1.3 percent of 3169 patients were infected with HCV; 5 percent of 764 tested patients were HCV positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>A single institution lookback study was performed in infants and children transfused with blood and blood products between 1982 and 1992 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Of the 5473 eligible patients, 4726 were locatable and 2758 were tested. A new diagnosis of HCV infection was confirmed in 1.6 percent (43 cases) of those tested.</p><p>These studies demonstrated that, although time-consuming, lookback programs were successful in identifying some patients who likely were infected with HCV through transfusion and were unaware of their exposure.</p><p>The sensitivity of HCV assays has significantly decreased the risk of transfusion-transmitted HCV and made it less likely that a substantial number of transfusion-transmitted HCV infections would be found in the future through large scale, public health-driven lookback initiatives. This has been demonstrated by a Canadian survey, which reported that only 0.8 percent additional, &quot;plausible&quot; cases of transfusion-transmitted HCV infection were found through public health notification programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-c-and-transfusion-a-lookback-primer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, for the individual patient who has received blood from a now HCV-positive donor, lookback and recipient notification programs would be an important part of post-transfusion care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hepatitis C virus (HCV) lookback program exists because concerns remain within the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Public Health Service that there is a population of individuals who may have been exposed to HCV through transfusions in the past. Lookback is the process through which patients who may have received pathogen-infected blood are identified by tracing a suspect donor's previous donations back to those specific recipients.
