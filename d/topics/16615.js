As this patient population grows older, an increased need for surgical interventions, such as coronary revascularization, will likely rise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will address issues surrounding HIV infection in the patient who needs surgery, including morbidity and mortality, the pre-operative evaluation, and post-surgical management. This topic will also address concerns regarding HIV transmission during surgical procedures. Discussions of postexposure prophylaxis after potential HIV exposures are discussed elsewhere.

Although lower CD4 cell counts were associated with higher mortality, the mortality difference between HIV-infected and uninfected patients persisted at all CD4 cell count strata. Hypoalbuminemia and older age were also independently associated with mortality. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another retrospective study of surgical outcomes, HIV-infected patients were matched 1:1 by type of surgery, year of intervention, gender, and age with HIV-uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Clinical outcomes, length of stay, and number of postoperative visits were similar among the 332 matched patient pairs. Various complications were no more frequent among HIV-infected patients, except for pneumonia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational data demonstrate conflicting results as to whether there is a higher risk of postoperative complications (eg, wound infection, endometritis, pneumonia) after Cesarean section among HIV-infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One retrospective study cited a higher risk of pulmonary complications and pneumonia among HIV-infected patients who underwent surgery for lung cancer compared with HIV-uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general approach to the HIV-infected patient in need of surgery is similar to that used for any other patient in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">General health status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimation of cardiac and pulmonary risk is important to review. Observational data suggest an increased risk of coronary artery disease among HIV-infected patients compared with HIV-uninfected patients, which may be related to ongoing chronic inflammation, despite viral suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. HIV-infected patients are also at risk for chronic pulmonary disease since the prevalence of smoking is high (over 40 percent) and the likelihood of cessation less than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As noted above, HIV-infected patients with lung cancer have a higher risk of pulmonary complications from surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Preoperative evaluation with a diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide may be helpful for patient selection.</p><p>Compared with HIV-uninfected patients, the prevalence of insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia is higher among HIV-infected patients, which may be partly related to adverse events of certain antiretroviral medications, lifestyle habits, immunologic dysfunction and HIV itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

A CD4 cell count and HIV viral load should be performed, if not available within the preceding three months. Clinicians need to be aware that acute medical conditions may transiently decrease the CD4 cell count and increase the viral load, so HIV parameters should be interpreted cautiously in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-and-interpretation-of-measurement-of-the-cd4-cell-count-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques and interpretation of measurement of the CD4 cell count in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-and-interpretation-of-hiv-1-rna-quantitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques and interpretation of HIV-1 RNA quantitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The CD4 cell count is a surrogate marker for degree of immune function and is used to determine whether prophylaxis against various opportunistic infections is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most studies have found that the incidence of postoperative bacterial complications and sepsis is increased in patients with lower CD4 cell counts, although some have yielded contrary results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/2,8-10,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8-10,21</a>]. One study found that a viral load of 30,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> or greater was associated with a threefold increased risk of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, for elective surgery, it is preferable to determine what interventions can be accomplished to attain viral suppression; these include initiation of therapy in the treatment-na&iuml;ve patient or determining whether drug resistance testing or poor adherence may be contributing to less than optimal virologic outcomes in the treatment-experienced patient. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'HIV infection and surgical morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p>In the patient with AIDS, it should be recognized that treatment will not lead to immediate immunologic improvement. Furthermore, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may potentially lead to other complications, such as rash or hepatotoxicity. Therefore, any decision to start therapy in the treatment-na&iuml;ve patient should be made in consultation with an HIV clinician or infectious disease specialist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommends that ART be initiated in all HIV-infected patients, regardless of CD4 cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Most patients who are aware of their HIV status and in care are taking ART, although many people with HIV infection remain undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have significant drug-drug interactions with many other agents. A review of potential drug interactions with antiretroviral medications should be performed during the inpatient hospitalization, particularly in preparation for induction of sedation and anesthesia. Detailed information on drug interactions can be found in the Lexicomp drug interaction program within UpToDate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Past medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific questions should be asked of the patient regarding a history of viral hepatitis, tuberculosis exposure, and alcohol and substance use, since these issues are prevalent in HIV-infected patients. A detailed history of sexually transmitted diseases is especially important in women undergoing surgery for possible tuboovarian abscess. Pregnancy testing should also be performed in women of child-bearing age who are undergoing surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional status should be assessed by recent dietary history and comparison of body weights over time. HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression are at risk for wasting and nutritional deficiencies.</p><p>Lipoatrophy, such as thinning of the extremities and malar atrophy, is also prevalent in patients with longstanding HIV infection on ART and needs to be differentiated from wasting secondary to advanced HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Lipoatrophy may also be accompanied by areas of lipodeposition (eg, cervicodorsal region, visceral adiposity), which may be mistaken for simple obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> (TDF), a commonly used nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, has been associated with tubular dysfunction and renal insufficiency, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A newer prodrug formulation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (TAF), appears to have less renal toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-kidney-disease-in-hiv-positive-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of kidney disease in HIV-positive patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Determination of platelet count and prothrombin time are important in assessing risk of bleeding, particularly in those patients who have advanced liver disease secondary to hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection. Thrombocytopenia may also be immune-mediated (ITP) related to underlying HIV infection, usually seen in untreated patients with advanced immunodeficiency. HIV-related ITP is usually manifested by mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, but occasionally platelet counts can drop below 10,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL</span> with an associated increased risk of bleeding.

However, if clinically necessary, stopping antiretroviral medications for a few days should not have a deleterious impact on their effectiveness. Viral resistance is more likely to occur when doses of some medications are intermittently missed over an extended period of time. </p><p>When altered mental status or gastrointestinal tract dysfunction interfere with the ability of the patient to take or absorb oral medications, all antiretroviral drugs should be held. Parenteral alternatives should be sought for agents used for prophylaxis for opportunistic infections (eg, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>) if it is anticipated that the patient will be unable to have oral intake for an extended duration of time.

However, in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected patients who have achieved immune reconstitution on ART appear to have excellent outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutritional consultation may be warranted postoperatively if oral intake is inadequate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoadrenalism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stress of surgery may unmask previously unsuspected hypoadrenalism, which is seen more commonly in patients with advanced HIV disease who have smoldering infections with <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex or cytomegalovirus. Many of the symptoms of adrenal dysfunction are nonspecific. Electrolyte changes (eg, hyponatremia or hyperkalemia) or hypotension may raise suspicion of the presence of hypoadrenalism in the postoperative setting; a cosyntropin stimulation test is indicated in this circumstance.

In such patients, routine blood cultures and isolator tubes for Mycobacterium avium complex infection should be performed in addition to the laboratories noted above. Symptoms of dyspnea or headache may also direct additional evaluation for pneumocystis pneumonia or cryptococcal meningitis, respectively.

The most common route of exposure leading to HIV infection among these healthcare workers was <span class=\"nowrap\">percutaneous/puncture</span> injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. It is significant that only one documented case has occurred since 1999. However, the reporting system is voluntary so underreporting of cases is possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54988\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54988 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>All cases of suspected occupationally-acquired HIV should be reported to state health department HIV surveillance staff and the CDC coordinator at 404-639-0934 or 404-639-2050. In the event of any exposure, prompt postexposure prophylaxis is critically important. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In a widely publicized incident in 1990, a Florida dentist was identified by DNA sequencing as the source of HIV infection in six of his patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. Despite intensive epidemiologic investigation, the mechanism of transmission was never established. </p><p>Following the incident involving the dentist, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiated 66 &quot;look-back&quot; investigations involving 22,759 patients who had invasive procedures performed by HIV-infected healthcare workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. Only 113 (0.5 percent) were found to have HIV infection, most of whom were aware of their condition prior to the time of the procedure. In the other cases, none of the viral strains were found to be identical to those of the healthcare workers based on DNA sequencing. In reviewing the available data, the CDC has estimated that the risk of HIV transmission from a healthcare worker to a patient during a surgical procedure is between 1 in 2.4 million to 24 million. </p><p>Another investigation was performed in an Israeli cardiothoracic surgeon who was found to be HIV-infected in 2007 when he presented with unexplained fevers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The surgeon had advanced HIV disease with a CD4 cell count of <span class=\"nowrap\">49/microL</span> and an HIV RNA level of &gt;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>. A look-back investigation was performed of all patients on whom he had operated during the previous 10 years. Of the 1669 patients identified, 545 (33 percent) underwent serologic testing; all were HIV-seronegative. In addition, none of the patients' names have appeared on a national registry of known HIV-seropositive persons. This report adds to the existing body of data, which argue for a very low risk of practitioner-to-patient HIV transmission in the present era. </p><p>After receipt of these results, an expert panel recommended allowing the surgeon to return to work with no restrictions on the types of procedures he performed, provided that the surgeon complete additional infection control instruction and adhere to routine HIV RNA monitoring to confirm ongoing viral suppression on antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p><p>On the basis of the investigation and the published literature, the panel did not require notification of prospective patients of the surgeon's HIV status because of the extremely low likelihood of transmission if these conditions were met.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5998429\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of the HIV-infected healthcare worker</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) has published guidelines for the management of healthcare workers who are infected with HIV and other bloodborne pathogens, such as hepatitis B and C viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In general, SHEA states that HIV-infected healthcare practitioners should not be prohibited from participating in patient-care activities solely based on HIV status. Specific recommendations are made based upon the healthcare worker's viral burden and category of clinical activity. The three categories of procedures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 1 &ndash; Those with minimal risk of blood transmission (eg, endoscopy, or routine rectal or vaginal examinations)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 2 &ndash; Those with possible risk of blood transmission, but unlikely (eg, endodontic dental procedures, abscess drainage, biopsies under local anesthesia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category 3 &ndash; Those with definite risk of blood transmission (eg, general surgery)</p><p/><p>The guidelines recommend that HIV-infected healthcare practitioners should not be restricted from Category 1 or 2 procedures if they have a viral load assay showing &quot;no detectable HIV&quot; (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span>. Those with HIV RNA &gt;10<sup>2</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> should refrain from Category 3 procedures. Those healthcare workers who have less than 10<sup>2</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> may be allowed to engage in Category 3 procedures if the following criteria have been met:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence of prior transmission from the healthcare practitioner to a patient </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infected healthcare worker continues have twice-yearly follow-up with the occupational medicine division regarding maintenance of viral suppression or low-level viremia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The healthcare practitioner gets HIV care from an expert in the field, who communicates with the expert panel regarding the practitioner's clinical status</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The healthcare practitioner strictly complies with all infection control procedures</p><p/><p>Guidelines from the United Kingdom recommend that patient notification should be decided on a case-by-case basis depending upon the perceived risk of transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), generally favorable surgical outcomes have been reported among HIV-infected patients undergoing a wide range of surgical procedures. Most studies have shown slightly greater morbidity and mortality compared with uninfected populations, especially in patients who have AIDS-related complications or lower CD4 cell counts. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'HIV infection and surgical morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-operative screening in the HIV-infected patient is similar to any other patient and should include evaluation of cardiac and pulmonary status and routine laboratories for assessment of platelets, hematocrit, creatinine and hepatic synthetic function. Measurement of the CD4 cell count is also important since immunosuppression may increase the risk of post-operative infection. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of potential drug interactions with antiretroviral medications should be performed in preparation for induction of sedation and anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When altered mental status or gastrointestinal tract dysfunction interferes with the ability of the patient to take oral medications, all antiretroviral drugs should be held. In the patient with AIDS, parenteral alternatives should be sought for agents used for prophylaxis against opportunistic infections if a prolonged duration of poor oral intake is anticipated. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most postoperative fevers in patients with HIV disease are from common causes, such as an infected intravascular catheter site, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, thrombophlebitis, and drug toxicity. However, the possibility of an opportunistic infection should be considered in the patient with advanced immunosuppression (eg, CD4 cell count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine preoperative screening for HIV infection in surgical patients is neither cost-effective nor a reasonable alternative to universal precautions. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of HIV transmission from a healthcare worker to a patient through a surgical procedure has been estimated to be extremely low, and few documented cases exist in the literature. HIV-infected healthcare practitioners should not be prohibited from participating in patient-care activities solely based on their HIV status. (See <a href=\"#H5998392\" class=\"local\">'Risk of HIV transmission from infected healthcare workers to patients'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-issues-in-hiv-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Filsoufi F, Salzberg SP, Harbou KT, et al.
