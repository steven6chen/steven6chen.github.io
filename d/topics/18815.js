Reasons for reintervention included device malfunction and treatment failure. Although some trials of SNM for OAB have found symptom improvement rates of 90 percent and cure rates up to 50 percent, the rate of reintervention should be considered in selecting treatment options when noninvasive therapies do not achieve sufficient symptom reduction.

However, a prospective cohort study found higher all-cause mortality and cancer incidence among people aged 59 to 82 who consistently smoked 10 or fewer cigarettes a day than among never-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-geriatrics/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Even smoking less than one cigarette daily was associated with higher mortality and cancer rates. Quitting smoking lowered the risks; the younger the age at quitting, the lower the risks. Sharing such data with patients may help to encourage quitting smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation#H99356499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;, section on 'Questionable utility of smoking reduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116211\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for hepatitis B virus infection (January 2018)</span></p><p>In the United States, an estimated 847,000 persons are living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In a recent best practice statement, the American College of Physicians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised HBV testing in patients with elevated aminotransferases and in asymptomatic individuals at high risk for exposure or severe adverse outcomes with a missed diagnosis (eg, those requiring immunosuppressive therapy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55052 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-geriatrics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In a randomized trial of 77 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> improved apathy scores compared with placebo over a 12-week treatment period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-geriatrics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Adverse effects were similar between groups. These results add support to low-dose methylphenidate as an option in patients with persistent and distressing apathy despite a cholinesterase inhibitor and treatment of depression.

In a series of 1509 patients with older generation pacemakers or ICDs (eg, those that don&rsquo;t specifically meet MRI-conditional criteria specified by the Food and Drug Administration, or &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; devices) who underwent thoracic or non-thoracic MRI examinations and were followed for one year, there were no clinically significant events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-geriatrics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. While this and earlier reports are reassuring, the presence of a non-MRI-conditional pacemaker or ICD requires precautionary measures including device programming before and after MRI and patient monitoring during the imaging procedure, with availability of a defibrillator and code cart. If the examination is indicated and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness, MR imaging in patients with non-MRI-conditional permanent pacemakers or ICDs can be undertaken provided specific precautionary measures are in place.

In an observational study of over 1300 persons with MGUS followed for a median of 34 years, the rate of progression was approximately 1 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-geriatrics/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Risk factors for progression included IgM MGUS, higher M protein, and abnormal free light chain ratio. The risk of progression at 20 years ranged from 7 percent for those with none of these risk factors to 55 percent for those with all three risk factors. We use these risk factors to stratify MGUS into risk groups for monitoring for progression.

The main updates to the schedule include previously announced recommendations for use of the two-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-zoster-shingles-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant zoster vaccine</a> in most adults &ge;50 years old and use of a third dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine for previously vaccinated individuals in a mumps outbreak setting.

We suggest RZV rather than ZVL for most patients who meet criteria for vaccination. RZV appears to provide greater protection against herpes zoster, and there is less concern for waning immunity. The choice of RZV as the preferred type of vaccine is consistent with recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-geriatrics/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Disadvantages of RZV are the need for two doses (versus one with ZVL), and an increased risk of mild to moderate side effects (pain at the injection site, myalgia, fatigue, headache, fever) that typically resolve in one to three days. These factors rarely prevent patients from completing the RZV series. For patients who previously received ZVL, we suggest revaccination with RZV. The optimal use of RZV in immunocompromised patients is still to be determined.

Influenza vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 viruses has been low, estimated at 32 percent during the 2016 to 2017 season in the United States and only 10 percent during the 2017 season in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-geriatrics/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. For these reasons, influenza should be high on clinicians' lists of possible diagnoses for ill patients, and the use of antiviral medications is even more important than usual in limiting the morbidity associated with influenza.

In a large randomized trial of 1182 hypertensive patients, self-monitoring of home blood pressure to inform antihypertensive titration, either with or without telemonitoring, led to lower blood pressure at one year compared with usual care (in which blood pressure was monitored only during clinic visits) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-geriatrics/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Self-monitoring of blood pressure at home is an inexpensive and potentially effective way of improving blood pressure control among hypertensive patients.

This has substantially changed the prevalence of hypertension among adults in the United States. According to NHANES data from 2011 to 2014, 46 percent of adults 18 years and older had hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-geriatrics/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Major changes from prior recommendations include a lower threshold for the diagnosis of hypertension based upon office blood pressure readings (hypertension now defined as a blood pressure &ge;130 mmHg systolic or &ge;80 mmHg diastolic), and a lower blood pressure goal <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;130/&lt;80</span> mmHg). Pharmacologic therapy is recommended for all hypertensive patients with a higher cardiovascular risk, and for lower-risk patients who have a blood pressure &ge;140 mmHg systolic or &ge;90 mmHg diastolic.

The guideline emphasizes the importance of appropriate diagnosis of MCI in order to assess for reversible causes of cognitive impairment, help patients and families understand the cause of their cognitive concerns, discuss prognostic implications with regard to dementia risk, and help plan for the future. Neuropsychological testing is recommended in patients who screen positive for MCI by history and brief office-based cognitive testing. An assessment for functional impairment is essential to help distinguish MCI from dementia.

In an analysis derived from the linked SEER-Medicare database, 72,000 individuals over the age of 65 diagnosed and treated for nonmetastatic CRC between 2000 and 2011 were compared with a matched cohort of Medicare patients without cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-geriatrics/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The 10-year cumulative incidences of new-onset CVD and heart failure were more than twofold higher in patients treated for CRC.
