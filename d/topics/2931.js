As a diagnostic category, CVD includes four major areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary heart disease (CHD) manifested by fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrovascular disease manifested by fatal or nonfatal stroke and transient ischemic attack</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral artery disease manifested by intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic atherosclerosis and thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm</p><p/><p>Although CHD is the most common manifestation of CVD, CHD represents only approximately 50 percent of the total number of first CVD events. The lifetime risk of CHD was illustrated in a study of 7733 participants, age 40 to 94, in the Framingham Heart Study who were initially free of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The lifetime risk for individuals at age 40 was 49 percent in men and 32 percent in women. Even those who were apparently free from disease at age 70 had a lifetime risk of 35 percent and 24 percent in men and women, respectively. The lifetime risk of CHD varies importantly with the aggregate risk factor burden (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69663\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69663 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

This topic discusses the various CVD risk models available for use in patients. Our approach to CVD risk assessment for primary prevention, including which patients should undergo CVD risk assessment, the approach to assessing risk, and the implications of the estimate risk on preventive therapies, is presented separately, as are discussions of the specific approach to the primary prevention treatment of various risk factors.

The choice of a specific risk model for CVD risk assessment should be individualized based on patient-specific characteristics (eg, age, gender, ethnicity). Most experts feel that the use of risk models that predict hard CVD events (ie, death, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke) are preferred over those that include other endpoints (ie, revascularization).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525914099\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical variables used in atherosclerotic CVD estimators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prediction of atherosclerotic CVD is based on a set of risk variables that are usually assessed in the outpatient setting.

Among the many reasons why specific risk calculators are more popular are ease of use, applicability to a clinician&rsquo;s patient population, outcomes measured, and professional society recommendations. Some key features of the most commonly utilized risk calculators include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Framingham risk score (1998) and ATP III hard CHD risk score (2001) &ndash; The 1998 Framingham model used traditional risk factor categories and included data mostly from the 1970s and 1980s with long-term follow-up. Outcomes are limited exclusively to coronary heart disease (CHD). The 1998 Framingham model was the foundation for the 2002 ATP III hard CHD risk score and ATP III guidelines, which were developed in the United States. This was the primary risk score used in the United States from 2002 to 2013.

JBS3 included the same variables as <span class=\"nowrap\">QRISK/QRISK2</span> but extended the risk prediction from 10 years to 30 years, and included a variety of fatal and nonfatal CVD endpoints.

However, the JBS3 risk calculator extends the assessment of risk beyond the 10-year window of most prior risk estimators and allows for the estimate of &quot;heart age&quot; and the assessment of risk over longer intervals (eg, 50 years for a 45-year-old patient, 30 years for a 65-year-old patient, etc). The JBS calculator also allows for the estimated impact of lifestyle modifications on future risk (ie, the impact of smoking cessation on CVD risk), but these data are from statistical models and have not been externally validated.

When comparing the predicted and observed rates of CVD, four of the five risk scores significantly overestimated the 10-year CVD risk (between 25 and 115 percent), with only the Reynolds risk score slightly underestimating risk (3 percent underestimation). In a separate study comparing the 2013 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> calculator with the ATP III risk estimator among 2435 participants in the Framingham offspring and third-generation cohorts who were followed for over nine years, the 2013 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> calculator identified significantly more patients as statin eligible and more accurately identified patients who were at risk for incident CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>A variety of issues may underlie these differences, including secular changes in risk factors, greater use of cardiovascular prevention medicines and strategies over the past two decades, and a general decline in CVD morbidity and mortality in more recent times.

The opinion of this expert committee was that quantitative risk assessment should occur first, and if a risk-based treatment decision is uncertain, assessment of family history of CVD, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, or ankle-brachial index may be considered to inform treatment decision making. The committee did not recommend routine measurement of carotid intima-media thickness for risk assessment for a first atherosclerotic CVD event.

Lipid subfractions are generally classified by relative density, with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) most commonly measured.

While a general estimate of the relative risk for CVD can be approximated by counting the number of traditional risk factors present in a patient, a more precise estimation of the absolute risk for a first CVD event is desirable when making treatment recommendations for a specific individual. (See <a href=\"#H2458824542\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of multivariate risk models have been developed for estimating the risk of cardiovascular events in apparently healthy, asymptomatic individuals based upon assessment of multiple variables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F115308\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115308 \">table 1</a>). While all of the risk models have advantages and disadvantages, no single risk model will be appropriate for all patients. The choice of a specific risk model for CVD risk assessment should be individualized based on patient-specific characteristics (eg, age, gender, ethnicity). However, our experts feel that the use of risk models that predict hard events (ie, death, myocardial infarction, stroke) are preferred over those that include other endpoints (ie, revascularization).
