Resectoscopic techniques are performed under hysteroscopic visualization, using resectoscopic instruments to ablate or resect the endometrium. These techniques are also referred to as standard or first generation ablation. Non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation is performed with a device that is inserted into the uterine cavity and delivers energy to uniformly destroy the uterine lining.</p><p>In current practice, non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation is performed in most cases. However, in our practice, we perform resectoscopic ablation if the shape or size of the uterine cavity will not accommodate a non-resectoscopic device or if the patient has had multiple cesarean deliveries, to avoid ablating over the hysterotomy scar. &#160;</p><p>Resectoscopic techniques for endometrial ablation will be reviewed here. General principles (eg, indications, contraindications, preoperative and postoperative care) of endometrial ablation, techniques for non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation, as well as other management options for abnormal uterine bleeding, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of endometrial ablation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-ablation-non-resectoscopic-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial ablation: Non-resectoscopic techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF RESECTOSCOPIC ABLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resectoscopic ablation is done under hysteroscopic visualization and requires the use of a resectoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74123\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74123 \">picture 1</a>). There are currently four techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-or-resection-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: (1) endometrial dessication with an electrosurgical rollerball or rollerbarrel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55853\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55853 \">picture 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-or-resection-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; (2) resection with a monopolar or bipolar loop electrode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55853\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55853 \">picture 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-or-resection-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; (3) radiofrequency vaporization; or (4) laser vaporization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-or-resection-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>All methods dessicate the endometrium to the level of the basalis. The rollerball and rollerbarrel use thermal energy for heating the tissue to a temperature between 60 to 90&ordm;C, which dessicates and destroys the tissue. No tissue is removed. Thermal energy is also used with the monopolar and bipolar loop electrodes. However, the loop electrodes also resect the endometrium beyond the basalis layer to the myometrium. The resected tissue is sent to pathology for histologic diagnosis.</p><p>The vaporizing electrodes and laser fibers use high energy to rapidly heat the intracellular water to 100&ordm;C, causing vaporization of tissue. No tissue is removed.</p><p>Rollerball endometrial ablation is the most commonly used resectoscopic ablation method. Wire loop endomyometrial resection requires advanced hysteroscopic skills because of the risk of perforation, bleeding, and fluid absorption. Laser and vaporizing electrode ablation are not commonly performed due to expense of the equipment these methods require.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLLERBALL OR ROLLERBARREL OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General perioperative practices (eg, endometrial preparation, prophylactic antibiotics) and complications of endometrial ablation, as well as comparison with non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of endometrial ablation&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation#H40\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of endometrial ablation&quot;, section on 'Non-resectoscopic versus resectoscopic ablation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Instrumentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rollerball (or rollerbarrel) endometrial ablation is usually performed using monopolar electrical energy. Typically, the radiofrequency generator is set to 50 to 80 watts of coagulation or cutting current in order to desiccate the endometrium. We prefer cutting current, since coagulation current may result in vaginal burns caused by arcing and capacitance coupling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-or-resection-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, a bipolar resectoscope can be used. The advantage of a bipolar system is that saline is used, rather than electrolyte-free hypoconductive fluid. Excessive absorption of hypoconductive fluids (eg, glycine) may result in hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia following transurethral resection or hysteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positioning, sterile preparation, and cervical dilation are the same as for hysteroscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;, section on 'Procedure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the resectoscope through the cervix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After distension with fluid, inspect the uterine cavity. Note the size and location of intracavitary lesions (eg, fibroids, polyps).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Position the rollerball at one of the uterine cornu. It is helpful to start the desiccation at the cornua and then move to the anterior fundal wall due to bubble formation in the uterine cavity. Complete the ablation on the posterior wall since the bubbles formed will be anterior. Activate the current and bring the rollerball towards the surgeon. To avoid injury, it is important to keep the rollerball in view at all times and activate it only when moving it towards the operator. Desiccating the endometrium to a depth of 5 to 6 mm ensures the endometrium is destroyed to the level of the basalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54487 \">figure 1</a>) and is unlikely to regenerate in the presence of reproductive hormones. A thin endometrium will be quickly dessicated to this level. When the myometrium is reached, the surgeon will note small bubbles forming around the leading edge of the rollerball. Avoid dessication of the cervico-uterine junction since this may result in cervical stenosis or uterine occlusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat this motion until the entire surface of the endometrium has been desiccated.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with leiomyomas or polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resectoscopic endometrial ablation can be performed in women with submucosal leiomyomas. Women who have a submucosal leiomyoma in the uterine cavity can have a hysteroscopic myomectomy followed by endometrial ablation. This concurrent procedure is limited by the amount of irrigation fluid absorbed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia following transurethral resection or hysteroscopy&quot;</a>.) It is uncertain whether this procedure is more effective at improving uterine bleeding symptoms than myomectomy alone. This topic is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysteroscopic-myomectomy#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hysteroscopic myomectomy&quot;, section on 'Concomitant procedures'</a>.)</p><p>Endometrial polyps can be easily removed prior to ablation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women undergoing resectoscopic endometrial ablation, we suggest rollerball endometrial ablation rather than wire loop endomyometrial resection, unless it is advantageous to send tissue for histology. Outcomes appear similar for these two techniques, but wire loop resection requires more surgical skill. Laser and vaporizing electrode ablation are not commonly performed due to expense of the equipment. The outcomes for resectoscopic endometrial ablation are discussed here. Complication rates of endometrial ablation and comparison of resectoscopic with non-resectoscopic ablation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of endometrial ablation&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-endometrial-ablation#H40\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of endometrial ablation&quot;, section on 'Non-resectoscopic versus resectoscopic ablation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with successful endometrial ablation will have a reduction in uterine blood flow, but not amenorrhea. Studies vary according to whether menstrual blood loss is measured and the method used (eg, alkaline hematin method, pictorial blood assessment chart). Thus, amenorrhea, patient satisfaction, and subsequent surgery are used more commonly to assess treatment success than volume of uterine bleeding.</p><p>The best available data regarding resectoscopic ablation are in a meta-analysis of 21 randomized trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71119 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-or-resection-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Major findings were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of amenorrhea at one year was 38 percent and at two to five years was 48 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient satisfaction rate at one year was 88 percent and at two to five years was 87 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regarding subsequent surgery, the rate for any type of surgery (including hysterectomy) was 25 percent and for hysterectomy alone was 19 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison among resectoscopic techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the meta-analysis, 5 of the 21 randomized trials compared between two resectoscopic endometrial ablation methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-or-resection-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Comparison of rollerball, vaporizing electrode, and laser methods with endomyometrial resection showed no significant differences in rates of reduced menstrual bleeding, amenorrhea, or subsequent hysterectomy. Similarly, there was no significant difference in complications between ablation and resection; one study found a significant increase in irrigation fluid deficit (an additional 258 mL) with endomyometrial resection compared with vaporizing electrode. Some, but not all, trials found that resection had a longer operative duration than other types of resectoscopic ablation. The study with the longest follow-up was a randomized trial (not included in the meta-analysis) of 120 women assigned to either rollerball ablation or wire loop resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-ablation-or-resection-resectoscopic-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At 10-year follow-up, 93 percent of women in the study were amenorrheic. Women treated with other types of resectoscopic ablation compared with resection had the following rates of subsequent surgery: repeat ablation (13 versus 8 percent) and hysterectomy (25 versus percent 19); tests of significance were not reported.</p><p>General complications of resectoscopic and non-resectoscopic endometrial ablation are discussed separately.
