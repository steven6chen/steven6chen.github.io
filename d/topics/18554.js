Four general subtypes of congenital malformations have been described:</p><p><ul class=\"bulletCompact-block\"><li>Developmental venous anomalies</li><li>Capillary telangiectasias</li><li>Cavernous malformations</li><li>Arteriovenous malformations</li></ul></p><p>Developmental venous anomalies are most common in autopsy series, with an incidence of 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This is followed by arteriovenous malformations (1 percent), capillary malformations (telangiectasias, 0.7 percent), and cavernous malformations (0.4 percent). Developmental venous anomalies and capillary telangiectasia are usually benign, while cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have a greater tendency toward neurologic sequelae.</p><p>This topic will review our understanding of the natural history and treatment of these three lesions, which continues to evolve with our burgeoning imaging capabilities and clinical experience.</p><p>Cerebral and spinal cord arteriovenous malformations are discussed separately. Carotid cavernous fistulas are also discussed separately.

These small venous conduits empty into a central, dilated superficial or deep vein that drains normal brain. A stenosis is common on the collecting vein at the point of penetration into the draining dural sinus. Microscopically, the venous structures appear largely normal with rare degenerative changes consisting of thickening and hyalinization. The lesions are usually supratentorial with a frontal lobe predominance; they do not occur in the diencephalon, brainstem, or spinal cord.</p><p>DVAs most often are solitary, although multiple lesions have been described in association with other clinical syndromes (eg, the blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. DVAs also may occur concurrently with cavernous malformations in 13 to 40 percent, as well as with other intracranial vascular malformations and with superficial venous malformations of the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DVAs are considered benign lesions, although they may uncommonly present with seizures, progressive neurologic deficits, and hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Headache is the most common presenting complaint, followed by seizures and sensory-motor phenomena. However, a direct correlation between these symptoms and the existence of a DVA has not been firmly established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>In a ten-year prospective clinical and magnetic resonance imaging study involving 80 patients, a symptomatic hemorrhage rate of 0.34 percent per year was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In another study of 93 patients with 492 person-years of follow-up, no symptomatic hemorrhages occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The hemorrhages were usually minor, although fatal intracranial hemorrhages have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>A retrospective case series reviewed the clinical presentations of DVAs in 68 patients whose symptoms could not be attributed to other pathologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Cases with associated cavernous malformations were excluded. Two major pathophysiologic categories of symptomatic DVAs were identified:</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>Mechanical compression of intracranial structures by a component of the DVA was seen in 14 patients (21 percent). The most common associated symptoms were hydrocephalus, tinnitus, brainstem deficits, hemifacial spasm, and trigeminal neuralgia.</li><li>Flow-related symptoms were present in 49 patients (72 percent), with two subcategories:</li></ul></p><p><ul class=\"hyphen-block\"><li>Increased inflow in 19 patients (28 percent), typically related to an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) draining via dilated and ectatic medullary veins through a DVA, resulting parenchymal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraventricular hemorrhage or venous infarction. Symptoms included headaches, neurologic deficits, seizures, and coma.</li><li>Restricted outflow, either by an anatomic obstruction (eg, stenosis or thrombosis of the DVA or its draining vein) in 26 patients (38 percent) or by a physiologic obstruction (eg, increased venous pressure secondary to a distal arteriovenous shunt or AVM) in four patients (6 percent). Patients presented with variable combinations of neurologic deficits, headaches, seizures, and altered mentation, a clinical picture that resembled that of cerebral venous thrombosis, with increased intracranial pressure, venous congestive edema, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage.</li></ul></p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>No obvious alteration attributable to the DVA was found to explain symptoms in six cases (9 percent)</li></ul></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral angiography is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of DVAs, but they are usually identified with contrast enhanced cross-sectional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonenhanced CT scans do not usually demonstrate DVAs unless there is an associated cavernous malformation. After contrast administration, the enlarged vein is all that is typically identified. CT angiography (CTA) has also been used to identify DVAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI typically shows medullary veins converging on the dilated transcerebral vein. A characteristic &quot;sunburst&quot; pattern is seen on enhanced T1-weighted images. Gradient-echo sequences should be included to increase sensitivity for detecting associated cavernous malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. White matter abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcifications may be observed in the parenchyma surrounding the DVA. MRA usually demonstrates the dilated venous channel with variable depiction of the smaller medullary veins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned, cerebral angiography usually is not needed for the diagnosis of DVA since axial imaging sequences on MRI often suffice to make the diagnosis. In atypical cases, angiographic findings are pathognomonic; during the late capillary or venous phase there is a paucity of normal veins in the region of the lesion and a characteristic &quot;caput medusae&quot; appearance of the radially arranged small medullary veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56038\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56038 \">image 1</a>). The arterial phase is typically normal, however, so-called arterialized DVAs have been described with early phase opacification on angiography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enlarged arterial feeders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These lesions may have a bleeding risk that is more similar to an arteriovenous malformation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DVAs should be treated conservatively in the vast majority of cases, with associated symptoms such as headaches and seizures managed medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Surgery may be required in the rare patient with hemorrhage associated with a DVA or with uncontrolled seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In patients who undergo surgery, preoperative contrast enhanced imaging is required to identify an associated cavernous malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Venous infarction has been reported with DVA resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; thus, it is reasonable to simply evacuate the hematoma and leave the DVA in situ. Radiosurgical and endovascular techniques do not have a defined role in the management of these lesions.</p><p>In rare patients who present with symptomatic thrombosis of a DVA, there is anecdotal support for considering the use of systematic anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CAPILLARY TELANGIECTASIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capillary telangiectasias are small lesions most commonly found in the pons, middle cerebellar peduncles, and dentate nuclei. Multiple lesions are common.</p><p>The lesions are composed of small, dilated capillaries devoid of smooth muscle or elastic fibers. The intervening brain is often normal; it may also demonstrate areas of microhemorrhage or gliosis. A common histopathological feature of these lesions is a dilated efferent system, probably representing a venous channel.</p><p>An argument has been made for these lesions representing the early stage in the spectrum of development of cavernous malformations and other &quot;mixed&quot; vascular malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Although not proven, angiogenesis is believed to play a role in lesion evolution. Most telangiectasias represent an angiodysplastic phenomenon resulting from faulty embryogenesis of the vascular wall and have been associated with angiomatous phacomatoses such as Osler-Weber-Rendu (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia), Louis-Bar (ataxia-telangiectasia), and Wyburn-Mason (unilateral retinocephalic vascular malformation) syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Rare symptomatic cases occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; headache, nausea, and seizures have been described in patients with these lesions, although a causal relationship is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for the identification of capillary telangiectasias. Low signal intensity &quot;black dots&quot; on T1 and T2-weighted imaging are suggestive, although not diagnostic of these lesions.</p><p>Telangiectasias can be identified in the late <span class=\"nowrap\">arterial/early</span> capillary phase of angiography as a faint blush with an associated venous channel. Thus, these lesions can be distinguished from DVAs that are visualized during the venous phase of the study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capillary telangiectasias are nonoperable lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cavernous malformations (CMs) are also referred to as cavernous angiomas, cavernous hemangiomas, or cavernomas. They may occur sporadically or in a familial pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In these populations, de novo lesions have been demonstrated on serial MRIs. The de novo development of CMs after brain biopsy and after radiosurgery confirms the evolutionary nature of the lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Three genetic loci (CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3) responsible for familial cavernous malformations have been reported. Nearly all familial cases of cerebral cavernous malformation among Hispanic Americans have been linked to a founder mutation of CCM1 localized to 7q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Familial cases in white non-Hispanic families have been linked to CCM2 at 7p15-p13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and CCM3 at 3q25.2-q27 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>On gross examination, cavernous malformations have a characteristic &quot;mulberry&quot; appearance with engorged purplish clusters. They vary from 2 mm to several centimeters in diameter. Microscopic examination reveals that CMs are composed of dilated, thin walled capillaries with a simple endothelial lining and a thin, fibrous adventitia. Elastic fibers and smooth muscle are not present in the vessel walls. In the classic description of CMs, there is no intervening brain tissue between the channels of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, this may not be an essential criterion of CMs, as one histopathologic study of 71 CM cases noted intervening brain parenchyma in 50 (70 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and others have also noted intervening brain tissue in some fraction of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/18,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,31</a>].</p><p>The immediately surrounding tissue is usually gliotic and hemosiderin-laden due to previous hemorrhages. It contains dilated capillaries that may represent telangiectasias; this finding supports the integrative concept of capillary telangiectasias and cavernous malformations representing two ends of a spectrum in the development of cavernous malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Inflammation, calcification and, rarely, ossification may be identified with CMs, usually in larger lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) may be associated with CMs. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Developmental venous anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>In a series of 102 patients, DVAs associated with CMs were found in 23 percent; these occurred more often with lesions in the posterior fossa than the supratentorial compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</li><li>A later series of 57 patients with CMs found associated DVAs in 25 percent, and atypical patterns of venous drainage associated with CMs were seen in an additional 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</li></ul></p><p>The cerebrum is the most common location for CMs (70 to 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. They have been reported throughout the supratentorial compartment, but most commonly are subcortical and predisposed to the rolandic and temporal areas. Posterior fossa lesions comprise approximately 25 percent of CMs in most large series, with the majority located in the pons and cerebellar hemispheres. There have been only 36 cases of spinal cord cavernous malformations reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMs occur with equal frequency in males and females, with a mean age of 30 to 40, although women more commonly present with hemorrhage and neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. CMs that are associated with DVAs or atypical venous drainage may be more likely to present with symptomatic hemorrhage than CMs that are not associated with venous anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The presentation of CMs is specific to their location.</p><p><ul class=\"bullet-block\"><li>Supratentorial CMs commonly present with hemorrhage, seizures, and progressive neurologic deficits. Annual bleeding rates of 0.25 to 1.1 percent have been reported in several large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Seizures and progressive neurologic deficits may be the result of mass effect and secondary compromise of the microcirculation, or of microhemorrhages with local hemosiderin deposition irritating cortical or subcortical tissue.</li><li>Infratentorial CMs commonly present with hemorrhage and progressive neurologic deficits. Lesions in the brainstem present with cranial neuropathies and long-tract signs that cause progressive neurologic decline due to the high volume of critical nuclei and fiber tracts in this area. Thus, the natural history of brainstem lesions is worse than that of lesions in other areas. The annual bleeding rate for brainstem lesions is 2 to 3 percent per year, with recurrent hemorrhage rates approaching 17 to 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Progressive neurologic decline is observed in 39 percent.</li></ul></p><p>The natural history of asymptomatic lesions is significantly different from CMs presenting with clinical sequelae. A prospective study of 122 patients (mean age 37 years, range 4 to 82 years) found that 50 percent were initially asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. At a mean follow up of 34 months, the hemorrhage rate in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients was 0.6 and 4.5 percent, respectively. In another cohort, five year rates of hemorrhage were 2.4 percent for a first hemorrhage and 29 percent for a recurrent hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The risk of recurrent hemorrhage declines over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. While prior hemorrhage is a consistent risk factor for subsequent hemorrhage, studies have found inconsistent results as to other risk factors for hemorrhage and neurologic disability, including gender, lesion size, location, and multiplicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood flow through CMs is minimal. Thus, they may not be seen on angiography and often are referred to as &quot;angiographically occult.&quot; Other imaging modalities, particularly MRI, play a more important role in the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI usually establishes the diagnosis of cavernous malformation. Characteristic findings on T-1 and T-2 weighted images include a &quot;popcorn&quot; pattern of variable image intensities consistent with evolving blood products (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80348\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80348 \">image 2</a>). A dark hemosiderin ring, best seen on T2 or gradient echo sequences at the periphery of the lesion, is suggestive of remote hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68000\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68000 \">image 3</a>). Lesions that mimic CMs on MRI include low grade gliomas, hemorrhagic metastases (particularly melanoma), and choriocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Contrast enhanced images should be obtained once a CM is identified in order to delineate any potential associated DVAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Contrast enhanced images often demonstrate DVAs since they are associated with normal flow. On the other hand, CMs may have only scattered enhancement that is variable and inconsequential. This is critical in surgical planning since the resection of DVAs may compromise normal cortical venous drainage patterns and lead to venous infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT usually demonstrates a nonspecific, irregular, hyperdense mass with variable degrees of calcification.

These findings may be similar to the angiographic appearance of meningiomas.

Nevertheless, high complication rates in available published series coupled with clinical experience has dissuaded many from using stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of CMs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As an example, one retrospective analysis of 95 patients with 98 lesions found that stereotactic radiosurgery was associated with a significant drop in the annualized hemorrhage rate from 17 to 5 percent after a two-year post-treatment latency period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, at an average follow-up of 5.4 years, the incidence of permanent neurologic deficit and mortality was 16 and 3 percent, respectively, and these complications were attributed to radiation-induced injury. In addition, the combined effects of radiation-related injury and clinical progression of the lesion led to a significant decline in neurologic function during follow-up.</p><p>Given the available data, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of CMs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Brainstem location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brainstem CMs often are treated due to their aggressive natural history when there is progressive neurologic deterioration, with or without recurrent hemorrhage, if the lesion lies near the pial surface or if a non-eloquent tissue corridor exists to the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In one series of 23 patients with surgically treated brainstem CMs, 46 percent had transient neurologic deficits, 17 percent had new or worsened deficits, and 83 percent were significantly improved at a mean follow-up of 3.9 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

These are thin walled dilated capillaries with a simple endothelial lining. Associated developmental venous anomalies occur in about 25 percent.
