The word &quot;hemorrhage&quot; means bleeding. In a hemorrhagic stroke, the blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off because a blood vessel in or on the brain starts bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28217859\"><span class=\"h1\">How can you tell if someone is having a stroke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To tell if someone is having a stroke, just think of the word &quot;FAST&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73487 \">figure 1</a>). Each letter in the word stands for one of the things to watch for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>F</strong>ace &ndash; Does the person's face look uneven or droop to 1 side?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong>rm &ndash; Does the person have weakness or numbness in 1 or both arms? Does 1 arm drift down if the person tries to hold both arms out?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>S</strong>peech &ndash; Is the person having trouble speaking? Does his or her speech sound strange?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>T</strong>ime &ndash; <strong>If you see any of these signs, call 9-1-1.</strong> You need to act FAST and get to a hospital. The sooner treatment begins, the better the chances of recovery.</p><p/><p>Sometimes, people get a severe headache that starts all of a sudden when they have a hemorrhagic stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28217866\"><span class=\"h1\">How are hemorrhagic strokes treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the hospital, your doctor might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you medicines and other treatments to reduce the brain damage caused by the bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you medicines to lower your blood pressure, if your blood pressure is too high</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop any medicines you take that thin the blood or prevent it from clotting. If you take blood-thinning medicines, he or she might give you treatments to help your blood clot so that you stop bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do tests to figure out the cause of the bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watch the pressure in your brain to make sure that it doesn't get too high</p><p/><p>Some people are also treated with surgery, depending on their symptoms and other factors. Doctors can do surgery to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove a collection of blood, if it is pressing down on the brain or causing the brain to swell</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop the bleeding in the brain and fix the blood vessel that was bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28217873\"><span class=\"h1\">Can hemorrhagic strokes be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. You can lower your chance of having a hemorrhagic stroke by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting treated for high blood pressure &ndash; This is very important, because untreated high blood pressure is a common cause of hemorrhagic strokes. Treatment can involve lifestyle changes, diet changes, and medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not smoking</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not using illegal drugs</p><p/><p>If an abnormal blood vessel was the cause of the stroke, surgery can sometimes be done to fix it and prevent it from bleeding again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28217880\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after a stroke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people recover from a stroke without any long-term problems or with only minor problems. But many people have serious problems after a stroke. For example, they might be unable to speak or feed themselves, or they might be unable to move 1 side of their body. Specialists, such as physical therapists and speech therapists, can help.</p><p>After a stroke, people are also more likely to get other medical problems. These can include blood clots in the legs, heart problems, bed sores, or lung infections. Your doctor or nurse will try to prevent these problems from happening and will treat them if they do happen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28217887\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brain-aneurysm-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brain aneurysm (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-warfarin-coumadin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Warfarin (Coumadin) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=recovery-after-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Recovery after stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
