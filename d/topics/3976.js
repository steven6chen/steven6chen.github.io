In areas with ongoing exposure, clinical differentiation between relapse and reinfection can be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/13,15,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H243133450\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic brucellosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic brucellosis refers to patients with clinical manifestations for more than one year after the diagnosis of brucellosis is established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/15,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,38</a>]. Chronic brucellosis is characterized by localized infection (generally spondylitis, osteomyelitis, tissue abscesses, or uveitis) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> relapse in patients with objective evidence of infection (elevated antibody titers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recovery of brucellae from blood or tissues).</p><p>In some cases, patients attribute symptoms to chronic brucellosis in the absence of objective evidence for infection (low antibody titers, sterile cultures). Such patients typically have a cyclic course with intermittent back pain, arthralgia, sweats, and signs of psychoneurosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/15,16,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory findings should be interpreted together with clinical manifestations, exposure history, occupation, and history of past infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Laboratory tools for diagnosis of brucellosis include culture, serology, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Ideally, the diagnosis is made by culture of the organism from blood or other sites such as bone marrow or liver biopsy specimens. The sensitivity of culture is limited; if standard blood cultures are negative and brucellosis remains a consideration, the lab should be alerted regarding suspicion for brucellosis so that additional blood culture techniques can be performed. Serologic testing should also be performed; serum agglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the most common serologic tests.</p><p>Results of routine laboratory studies are usually nonspecific. White blood cell counts are usually normal to low; pancytopenia can occur. Minor abnormalities in hepatic enzymes are relatively common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>In neurobrucellosis, abnormalities of the cerebrospinal fluid typically include a pleocytosis of 10 to 200 white blood cells (predominantly mononuclear cells), elevated protein levels, and hypoglycorrhachia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

Culture techniques are time consuming, insensitive, and pose a risk for laboratory infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The classic biphasic (solid and liquid) Ruiz-Castaneda blood culture technique is still used in developing settings, but automated blood culture systems are more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The percentage of cases with positive blood cultures ranges from 15 to 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The majority of blood cultures are positive between the 7th and 21st day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The semiautomatic methods (BACTEC 9204 and <span class=\"nowrap\">Bac/Alert)</span> shorten considerably the time taken for detection; the presence of <em>Brucella</em> can be detected by the third day of incubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/7,15,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15,48</a>].</p><p>Lysis-centrifugation technique provides rapid diagnosis and also has high sensitivity in confirmation of brucellosis, especially of chronic illness. In one report, the lysis-centrifugation technique was more sensitive than Ruiz-Castaneda culture in both acute (91 versus 72 percent) and chronic brucellosis (74 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Compared with early versions of automated blood culture systems, the lysis-centrifugation approach had shorter time to detection but, in some cases, the automated systems produced higher sensitivity rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Studies with the newer continuous monitoring systems indicate that the BACTEC 9000 series is able to achieve times to detection that are shorter than those of lysis centrifugation and has greater sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Bone marrow culture is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of brucellosis. It is significantly more sensitive than blood culture, especially in chronic cases. The time to detection is shorter, and prior use of antibiotics does not reduce the sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, because harvesting bone marrow for culture is an invasive procedure, bone marrow culture is reserved for patients with abnormal hematologic findings, fever of unknown origin, and negative brucellosis serology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A presumptive diagnosis of brucellosis can be made by demonstrating elevated or rising titers of specific serum antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The interpretation of serological tests can be difficult, particularly in the setting of chronic infection, reinfection, relapse, and in endemic areas where a high proportion of the population has antibodies against brucellosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Positive serological test results can persist long after recovery in treated individuals, so it is not always possible to distinguish serologically between active and past infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/39,40,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,53</a>].</p><p>A variety of serologic methods that allow the detection of antibodies against the cell wall components or some cytoplasmic proteins have been used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum agglutination (standard tube agglutination)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rose Bengal agglutination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coombs test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunocapture agglutination (Brucellacapt)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2-mercaptoethanol agglutination</p><p/><p>Serum agglutination testing (SAT) is the modality for which there is the greatest published experience and remains the reference to which other tests are compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/3,15,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15,54</a>]. The best serological definition of brucellosis is confirmation by a fourfold or greater rise in <em>Brucella</em> agglutination titer between acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens obtained &ge;2 weeks apart and studied at the same laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], but often this definition is not clinically practical and may delay therapy. There are no absolute thresholds for confirmatory titers. In general, positive titers consist of 1:80 in nonendemic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and 1:160 in endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/17,18,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,34</a>]. It is important to note that infection with <em>B. canis</em> does not produce antibodies that cross-react with standard <em>Brucella</em> antigens. <em>B. canis</em> serology should be specifically requested if illness due to this species is suspected or if brucellosis is suspected but the standard tube agglutination test is negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/48,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,56</a>].</p><p>ELISA is the second most common serologic method utilized in evaluating patients with suspected <em>Brucella </em>infections. ELISA is rapid, objective, and highly sensitive and specific; it measures immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgG, and IgA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. While ELISA with smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS) is a very promising test, there are problems of interlaboratory comparability due to issues related to standardization, reagent quality, and interpretation of results (particularly when based on optical density readings alone); standard reference materials are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/7,15,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15,39</a>]. One investigation concluded that ELISA did not improve diagnostic accuracy compared with SAT and Coombs in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Another showed that the sensitivity of either ELISA IgM or IgG were lower than SAT; the sensitivity and specificity were similar when IgM and IgG were used in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-brucellosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Patients may have a multitude of complaints with fever in the absence of other objective findings. The onset of symptoms may be abrupt or insidious, developing over several days to weeks. The musculoskeletal and genitourinary systems are the most common sites of involvement. Neurobrucellosis, endocarditis, and hepatic abscess occur in 1 to 2 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of brucellosis should be considered in an individual with otherwise unexplained fever and nonspecific complaints who has a possible source of exposure (eg, contact with animal tissues, ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory tools for diagnosis of brucellosis include culture and serology. Ideally, the diagnosis is made by culture of the organism from blood or other sites, such as bone marrow or liver biopsy specimens. Serologic tests include tube agglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adults with nonfocal disease, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Dosing is doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily plus rifampin 600 to 900 mg (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> orally once daily for six weeks. (See <a href=\"#H2045332\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adults with spondylitis, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

The duration of therapy is generally prolonged and needs to be individualized according to clinical signs and symptoms; in general, it should be continued until cerebrospinal fluid parameters have returned to normal.
