Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterized by polyuria and polydipsia that results from loss of urine concentrating ability of the kidneys. DI in pregnancy can be the result of central causes (eg, head trauma, pituitary adenoma), nephrogenic causes (eg, gene mutations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> toxicity) or transiently related to pregnancy-specific changes (also known as gestational DI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115436 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus-of-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

This effect is mediated by activation of the V2 receptor in the renal collecting tubules, resulting in enhanced renal water reabsorption and the formation of concentrated urine. Most diabetes insipidus is caused by either inadequate ADH production (central diabetes insipidus [DI]) or renal resistance to ADH (nephrogenic DI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-output-in-diabetes-insipidus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine output in diabetes insipidus&quot;, section on 'Determinants of urine output'</a>.)</p><p>Between the eighth gestational week and midpregnancy, the metabolic clearance of ADH increases four- to sixfold because of an increase in vasopressinase (also known as oxytocinase), which is produced by the placenta. Enzyme activity continues to increase, peaks in the third trimester, remains high during labor and delivery, and then falls to undetectable levels two to four weeks postpartum. In most pregnant women, plasma concentrations of ADH remain in the normal range, despite increased metabolic clearance, because of a compensatory increase in ADH production by the pituitary gland. As a result, most women do not become polyuric.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H655507194\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient DI of pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient DI of pregnancy is caused by an amplification of the normal pregnancy-related increase in vasopressinase levels or activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115436 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Women with preeclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome; and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are at increased risk for transient DI of pregnancy.

On careful questioning, they typically describe polyuria and polydipsia prior to pregnancy, with worsening of symptoms during pregnancy. Placental vasopressinase, which degrades circulating endogenously secreted ADH (vasopressin), results in overt ADH deficiency in patients with preexisting partial, largely asymptomatic, DI. In these cases, polyuria tends to recur with every pregnancy.

In patients with primary polydipsia, limiting water intake results in a rapid rise in the plasma sodium concentration and relatively rapid reduction in polyuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Primary polydipsia'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urinary frequency without polyuria</strong> &ndash; Urinary frequency is almost universal in pregnancy but does not necessarily reflect a pathologic increase in urine volume.

This is easily distinguished from DI by the presence of an appropriately concentrated urine (urine osmolality &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg,</span> and usually much higher than that). In these cases, polyuria is absent and patients are often oliguric.

As most patients will have become hypernatremic rapidly, the serum sodium concentration can be corrected rapidly without fear of cerebral edema, which is a complication of the treatment chronic hypernatremia that has been reported exclusively in infants.

This situation most frequently occurs during labor and delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transient or central DI </strong>&ndash; Polyuria due to transient DI of pregnancy or central DI in pregnancy can be effectively treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (DDAVP), a vasopressin analog, which is resistant to degradation by vasopressinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus-of-pregnancy/abstract/4,6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,18</a>]. For women with intact thirst and access to water, a reasonable starting dose is 10 mcg intranasally or 0.05 mg orally, either at bedtime or twice daily. The dose should be titrated to achieve relief of polyuria and a serum sodium of 133 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> targeting the mild physiologic hyponatremia of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus-of-pregnancy/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>].

The dose and dosing interval are adjusted to allow mild polyuria between doses and thus avoid severe hyponatremia. No adverse maternal or fetal effects from desmopressin use during pregnancy have been reported, although trial data are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus-of-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Treatment strategies in nonpregnant individuals include thiazide diuretics and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, but these agents are generally avoided in pregnancy. Similarly, a low-protein, low-sodium diet may decrease polyuria, but its safety in pregnancy has not been studied. Women should be encouraged to drink to thirst, with continuous access to water, to avoid hypernatremia.

Women with polyuria, defined as a urine output that exceeds 3 L per 24 hours, require a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> challenge, with or without or supervised water restriction. Some women can delay evaluation until they are postpartum. (See <a href=\"#H3375559083\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of DI is confirmed in a woman with polyuria by an increased serum sodium (&gt;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and an inappropriately dilute urine (urine osmolality &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span>.) (See <a href=\"#H3244435531\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When evaluating pregnant women for possible DI, the clinician should consider and exclude the following: primary polydipsia, urinary frequency (without polyuria), and hypernatremia due to inadequate water intake. (See <a href=\"#H3983172254\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient DI of pregnancy can be effectively treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (DDAVP), a vasopressin analog that is resistant to degradation by vasopressinase. For women with intact thirst and access to water, a reasonable starting dose is 10 mcg intranasally or 0.05 mg orally, either at bedtime or twice daily. (See <a href=\"#H454288377\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypernatremia, which can occur if water intake is restricted, can result in serious neurologic consequences in both the mother and fetus. Hypernatremia should be treated with intravenous hypotonic fluid. (See <a href=\"#H4094105176\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the overall risk of obstetric complications is similar for women with and without DI of pregnancy, limited data suggest an association between transient DI of pregnancy and preeclampsia. (See <a href=\"#H4094105176\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DI caused by increased vasopressinase activity resolves postpartum and does not usually recur in subsequent pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H3802559298\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus-of-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Robertson GL.
