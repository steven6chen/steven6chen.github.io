The major histologic manifestations of these secondary causes of renal injury are interstitial fibrosis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (called secondary FSGS), which are superimposed upon any primary renal injury that may be present.

Data are limited on nonproteinuric CKD, defined as CKD associated with urine protein excretion less than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Among patients with proteinuric CKD, the preferred agents are drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and, at least in patients with type 2 diabetes, angiotensin II receptor blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H594330\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of proteinuria and the proteinuric response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with CKD, higher degrees of urinary protein excretion are associated with a more rapid decline in GFR, regardless of the primary cause of the renal disease and the initial GFR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68921 \">figure 1</a>). In addition to the initial urinary protein excretion, a number of studies have reported correlations between reduction in proteinuria with antihypertensive therapy and slower progression of the renal disease.

Interventional studies show that lower blood pressure targets (below <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg) are associated with better renal outcomes in patients with proteinuric CKD (defined as urine protein excretion greater than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

When the blood pressure is controlled, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are more effective than other antihypertensive drugs in reducing proteinuria and in slowing the rate progression of proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), regardless of etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These benefits can be demonstrated even in patients who are not hypertensive and in those with diabetic nephropathy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on progression of CKD'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The generally greater antiproteinuric effect seen with the ACE inhibitors and ARBs is compatible with a greater fall in intraglomerular pressure, which has been demonstrated in animal models of proteinuric CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This effect is mediated in part by dilation of both efferent and afferent glomerular arterioles, rather than only the afferent arterioles as occurs with other classes of antihypertensive drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease-experimental-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of chronic kidney disease: Experimental studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79962422\"><span class=\"h2\">Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of trials have identified a preferential benefit of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in reducing proteinuria, compared with other antihypertensive drugs. The rationale behind these studies is the observation that protein excretion varies directly with the intraglomerular pressure in animals with structural glomerular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In addition to the reduction in intraglomerular pressure, a variety of other mechanisms may contribute to RAS inhibitor-induced reductions in proteinuria.

They can also acutely reduce the glomerular filtration rate, particularly if the patient is hypovolemic.

The antiproteinuric effect is most prominent in patients who are on a low-sodium diet or who are treated with diuretics since relative volume depletion results in greater angiotensin II dependence of the glomerular microcirculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Importance of salt intake'</a> below.)</p><p>It is unclear whether the ACE inhibitor dose associated with a maximal antihypertensive effect is the same as that required for an optimal antiproteinuric effect. This issue was addressed in a study of 23 proteinuric patients with nondiabetic renal disease who were given increasing doses of spirapril for maximal antihypertensive effect (median dose of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> as assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

An additional increase of spirapril to a supramaximal dose (median dose of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> failed to further decrease either blood pressure or proteinuria. In contrast to these findings, other studies have reported a dissociation between the doses required for optimal antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects, suggesting that the amounts necessary for these two benefits are likely to vary among patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79962776\"><span class=\"h3\">Angiotensin II receptor blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) has been demonstrated in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic CKD.

In a 2008 meta-analysis of 49 randomized trials (mostly small), the reduction in proteinuria at 5 to 12 months was similar with ARBs and ACE inhibitors (ratio of means 1.08, 95% CI 0.96-1.22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>As with ACE inhibition, there appears to be a dose effect, with greater reduction of proteinuria at higher (even supramaximal) doses in both nondiabetic and diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>].

As an example, in a study of 790,342 military veterans aged 70 years or older, the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) with RAS inhibition to prevent one ESRD event was calculated, assuming that such medications result in a 30 percent lower relative risk (similar to the effect in younger populations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Thus, repeat measurement of the serum creatinine and potassium should be obtained during this time frame after the initiation or intensification of therapy.</p><p>The long-term clinical significance of a modest and stable rise in serum creatinine after the initiation or intensification of RAS inhibitor therapy is uncertain since it is due in part to a reduction in intraglomerular pressure, which is thought to contribute to the slowing of disease progression. An initial elevation in serum creatinine of as much as 30 to 35 percent above baseline that stabilizes within the first two months of therapy is considered acceptable and <strong>not</strong> a reason to discontinue therapy as long as there is not an excessive fall in blood pressure; the latter is most likely to occur in patients who are volume depleted at the initiation of therapy due, for example, to diuretic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>].

Overall, more aggressive blood pressure lowering reduces the risk of CKD progression among patients with proteinuric renal disease, but not among those without proteinuria. Proteinuria was variably defined in these studies as a protein-to-creatinine ratio greater than 0.22 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/g</span> or a 24-hour protein excretion greater than 300 mg. In addition, more aggressive blood pressure lowering reduces all-cause mortality both in patients with proteinuric CKD and in those with nonproteinuric CKD.

More intensive blood pressure control was associated with reduced overall mortality (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-0.90), and the reduction in death was similar in patients with and without proteinuria. Aggressive blood pressure lowering also reduced the progression to ESRD (hazard ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-1.00), but the benefit was confined to those with proteinuric CKD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A larger meta-analysis of nine goal blood pressure trials and 8127 patients reported no effect of intensive blood pressure lowering on CKD progression, cardiovascular events, or mortality at 3.3 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

On intention-to-treat analysis, patients in the aggressive control group were significantly less likely to experience renal failure (adjusted hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.91), or either renal failure or death (0.77, 95% CI 0.65-91). Renal failure accounted for approximately 90 percent of events and a hazard ratio was not provided for mortality alone.</p><p>However, a subgroup analysis of this extended follow-up revealed that the benefit from aggressive blood pressure control was only significant in patients with protein excretion exceeding 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (hazard ratio approximately 0.6 to 0.7).

The 2004 <span class=\"nowrap\">K/DOQI</span> Clinical Practice Guidelines on hypertension and antihypertensive agents in CKD recommends a goal less than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> creatinine from the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on a random urine specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. However, proteinuria estimated from the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio may be substantially different from daily protein excretion. As an example, creatinine excretion in men under the age of 50 years is 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of lean body weight per day. Thus, a nonobese man with a lean body weight of 80 kg may excrete 2000 mg of creatinine. In such a patient, a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> represents protein excretion of approximately 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. This would be a suboptimal outcome in patients with IgA nephropathy in whom protein excretion above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is associated with an adverse renal prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy#H449899\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Protein excretion above 1 g/day'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Because of this potential limitation in using only the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, we suggest the following approach to measuring and monitoring protein excretion, which takes into account both the greater accuracy of a complete 24-hour urine collection and the greater ease of monitoring with a spot urine specimen: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 24-hour urine collection should be obtained during the initial evaluation, measuring the excretion of both protein and creatinine. The completeness of the 24-hour urine collection can be estimated from creatinine excretion. Normal values of creatinine excretion vary with muscle mass and, hence, age, gender, and physical activity: in patients under the age of 50 years, 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> estimated lean body weight in men and 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> estimated lean body weight in women; and, in patients between the ages of 50 and 90 years, there is a progressive 50 percent decline in creatinine excretion (to about 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> estimated lean body weight in men). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H20663240\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Creatinine clearance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial 24-hour urine collection seems complete, then the rate of protein excretion is probably an accurate estimate. The urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on this specimen can be related to the total amount of proteinuria, and the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on a random specimen can subsequently be used to monitor the degree of proteinuria, as long as muscle mass appears stable. If, for example, 24-hour protein excretion is 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in an apparently complete collection and the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is 2.0, then a ratio below 0.7 would represent goal proteinuria below 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. </p><p/><p>We suggest a proteinuria goal of less than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> which is similar to the <span class=\"nowrap\">K/DOQI</span> recommendation of 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> creatinine. It may be difficult to attain this goal, particularly in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. In such patients, we suggest a minimum reduction in proteinuria of at least 50 to 60 percent from baseline values <strong>plus</strong> protein excretion less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. This approach is based upon an observational study in 348 patients with membranous nephropathy and nephrotic syndrome who were treated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition and, in some cases, immunosuppressive therapy and were followed for a minimum of one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. The patients who attained these goals, when compared with patients who reached only one or neither of these goals, had marked reductions in the rate of loss of glomerular filtration rate (0.17 versus 0.86 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per month) and in the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (9 versus 29 percent, adjusted hazard ratio 0.17). Subnephrotic proteinuria is also associated with a good renal prognosis in primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;, section on 'Degree of proteinuria'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>IgA nephropathy represents an exception to the above approach since protein excretion above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and perhaps above 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is associated with a higher risk of disease progression. Thus, the proteinuria goal is less than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and perhaps less than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> if possible, in <strong>all</strong> patients.

Observational studies show that patients with CKD and a diastolic pressure below 90 mmHg have better preservation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than hypertensive patients. Lower blood pressure targets (below <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg) are associated with better renal outcomes in patients with proteinuric CKD (defined as urine protein excretion greater than 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>.

This preferential effect is thought to be due to a reduction in intraglomerular pressure and perhaps other factors. The antiproteinuric effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs appear to be similar. (See <a href=\"#H79962422\" class=\"local\">'Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> have significant antiproteinuric effects in patients with proteinuria. By comparison, the dihydropyridines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>, have a variable effect on proteinuria, ranging from an increase to no effect to a fall in protein excretion.

Similar findings are seen in diabetic nephropathy. If a low-salt diet is not achieved, administration of a diuretic can also enhance the antiproteinuric effect of RAS inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Importance of salt intake'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple randomized clinical trials in patients with nondiabetic CKD, some with placebo control and some with an active control, have demonstrated a benefit of antihypertensive therapy with RAS inhibitors, mostly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in patients with <strong>proteinuric</strong> nondiabetic CKD. It seems likely that angiotensin receptor blockers have a similar renoprotective effect as ACE inhibitors in nondiabetic CKD but supportive data are limited. Additional evidence in support of a preferential benefit with ACE inhibitors in proteinuric patients has come from meta-analyses. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on progression of CKD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-hoc analyses of these and other studies have shown correlations between the reduction in proteinuria with therapy and slower progression of renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'The proteinuric response as a predictor of outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When trying to slow the progression of nondiabetic CKD, protein excretion above 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> identifies patients who are most likely to benefit from antihypertensive therapy with RAS inhibitors. By contrast, there appears to be no preferential benefit of RAS inhibitors in patients excreting less than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.
