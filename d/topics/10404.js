In particular, fever is frequently the first indication of serious and life-threatening bacterial infections. While commonly discussed in pediatric care, this is a problem throughout the lifespan. Fever is also present in other serious SCD-associated conditions such as acute chest syndrome or vaso-occlusive pain episodes. As a result, patients with SCD and fever should be evaluated and treated promptly to avoid significant morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Although patients with sickle cell anemia (hemoglobin SS; HbSS) and the closely related sickle cell-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia (HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia) are at highest risk of bacteremia because of their predictable early loss of splenic function, many centers evaluate patients with the variant hemoglobinopathies such as sickle-hemoglobin C disease (HbSC) and sickle cell-&beta;<sup>+</sup> thalassemia (HbS-&beta;<sup>+</sup> thalassemia) in a similar fashion when a predetermined level of fever develops. Splenic dysfunction worsens with age in patients with all genotypes, and all adults with SCD and fever should be evaluated promptly according to similar guidelines.</p><p>The management of the patient with SCD and fever will be reviewed here. Overviews of the other clinical manifestations and their management in patients with SCD are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The <strong>prevention</strong> of infections is a major goal of the management of individuals with SCD, especially young children. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Infection prevention'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the widespread availability of pneumococcal and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> vaccines and the general use of penicillin prophylaxis, individuals with SCD and fever remain at risk for invasive infections from pneumococcus and other organisms. In children with SCD, the major cause of death historically has been infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Prior to the availability of <em>H. influenzae</em> type b and pneumococcal vaccines, young children (below five years of age) with SCD in the United States had a 13 percent risk of developing bacterial sepsis or meningitis with mortality rates of 30 and 10 percent in patients with sepsis and meningitis, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although mortality has significantly decreased since the introduction of vaccines, particularly since licensure of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar) in 2000, approximately one-quarter of deaths between 1999 and 2002 in children with SCD in the first nine years of life continue to be due to infectious causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Case series published since the introduction of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine indicate that the prevalence of bacteremia in febrile patients with SCD remains significant at 0.8 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with SCD are more susceptible to infections because of functional asplenia. Autoinfarction caused by sickling of red blood cells results in a nonfunctioning spleen, which is unable to filter bacteria from the bloodstream. Functional asplenia increases the risk of invasive infection by encapsulated organisms, such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>H. influenzae</em>. Prior to universal vaccination for <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and <em>H. influenzae</em>, young children with HbSS had a 400-fold increased risk of pneumococcal sepsis and a two- to fourfold increased risk of <em>H. influenzae</em> sepsis compared with age-matched children without SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and management of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;, section on 'Role of the spleen in host defense'</a>.)</p><p>The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) found that 20 of 64 (31 percent) infants with HbSS between 8 and 13 months of age had functional asplenia, defined by the inability of their spleens to normally take up radiolabeled technetium sulfur-colloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. An increased number of pocked or pitted red blood cells, a non-invasive laboratory indicator of functional asplenia, was present in 94 percent of patients by 60 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. More recently, baseline data from the Pediatric <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Hydroxyurea</a> Phase III Clinical Trial (BABY HUG) showed using both of these techniques that only 12 percent of 193 infants with a mean age of 12.2 months had normal spleen function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>With the recognition of the increased risk of bacterial infection with SCD, preventive measures (eg, immunizations) and the use of daily prophylactic and empiric antibiotic therapy for fever have reduced the mortality rate in patients with SCD. This was best illustrated in the Dallas Newborn Cohort, a prospective study of 711 children identified by newborn screening, born in Texas on or after November 1, 1983, and treated at a single center up to 18 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The overall mortality rate was 0.59 per 100 patient-years compared with rates of 3 per 100 patient-years for children less than five years of age reported before the implementation of prophylactic penicillin and routine pneumococcal vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This improved survival in childhood has continued, only to be balanced by increased rate of death in young adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Although the universal use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the United States has led to a decrease in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>] and death from an infectious cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], young children with SCD, especially with HbSS, remain at a high risk for invasive pneumococcal infection, defined as an incidence of &ge;150 cases per 100,000 people per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In Tennessee, the rate of invasive pneumococcal disease in children under two years of age with SCD decreased from 3650 to 335 cases per 100,000 person-years between the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) pre-vaccine to post-vaccine periods of 1995 to 1999 and 2000 to 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similar reductions from 2044 to 134 cases per 100,000 person-years were seen in children &lt;5 years of age. Thus, patients with SCD remain at risk for bacteremia from <em>S. pneumoniae</em> as well as organisms that are not prevented by immunization, such as <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4,14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,16,17</a>]. More recently, an increase in invasive <em>S. pneumoniae</em> infections with non-vaccine strains has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>There are a paucity of formal evidence-based standards of care for individuals with SCD. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) released guidelines for the management of SCD in 2014. This document was developed with rigid evidence-based methodology; however, many of the recommendations are only of moderate strength with low quality of evidence, usually based on expert consensus, and are consistent with the approach discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Indeed, prospective studies of the epidemiology and management of fever in children and adults with SCD are one of the many evidence gaps in the guidelines cited in an editorial by the writing group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A collaborative effort has shown that there is excellent adherence to these practice recommendations in pediatric emergency departments across the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of 4853 visits for SCD and fever in pediatric patients, 92 percent had a complete blood count (CBC), 94 percent had a reticulocyte count, 93 percent had blood cultures, and 92 percent received antibiotics. Although there was a sevenfold difference in admission rates, the recommendations above appear to be in wide clinical use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because fever may be the first and only indication of a serious bacterial infection in a patient with SCD, patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parents should be counseled to seek prompt medical attention for a predetermined elevated temperature. This should occur even if the fever rapidly goes away with or without antipyretics.</p><p>Although not rigorously studied, most centers suggest medical evaluation when the patient's temperature exceeds 38.5&deg;C (101.5&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

One study of nonimmunized children who did not receive prophylactic penicillin reported that 8 of the 23 children with pneumococcal septicemia died and 15 developed meningitis prior to the initiation of a clinical program of rapid administration of empiric antibiotic therapy. In contrast, after establishment of this clinical program, there were no deaths and only two cases of meningitis in the 11 children with pneumococcal septicemia. </p><p>Antibiotic recommendations are based upon the epidemiology and antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the pathogens most likely to cause infection. In the United States, the most common bacteria include <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>E. coli</em>, and <em>S. aureus</em>.</p><p>Several observational studies from equatorial Africa reported that infection with <em>S. aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>], <em>Klebsiella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,31</a>], and <em>Salmonella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/28,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32</a>] were more common than <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. However, a subsequent large case-control study of hospitalized rural Kenyan children under 14 years of age found <em>S. pneumoniae</em> (41 percent) to be the most common isolate in children with SCD and bacteremia, followed by non typhi <em>Salmonella</em> species (18 percent), and <em>H. influenzae</em> type b (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In general, these patients do not require admission for uncomplicated fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3511732\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At discharge it is important to do the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Infection prevention'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resume prophylactic penicillin if previously prescribed (eg, in a child), or if other antibiotics have been prescribed, instruct when the family is to resume the penicillin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Update immunizations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review the necessity of returning for medical evaluation for recurrent temperature &gt;101.5&deg;F (38.5&deg;C)</p><p/><p>Despite the universal and repeated recommendation that individuals with SCD and a fever of 101.5&deg;F should be re-evaluated; a 2015 study found that even in a leading center only 55 percent of parents &quot;always&quot; follow this recommendation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fever-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The major difficulty is that there are no clear prognostic indicators for deciding which person with SCD and fever will have bacteremia with a potentially fatal outcome. Thus, frequent reminders of the need to return should fever reoccur 24 hours or more later are important on discharge from admission or emergency department or outpatient visit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3039687900\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-hemoglobinopathies\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Hemoglobinopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever is a common presenting feature of many clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease (SCD). In particular, fever can be the first indication of a serious and sometimes life-threatening infection in patients with SCD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adults with SCD are more susceptible to invasive bacterial infections, particularly encapsulated organisms (eg, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and <em>H. influenzae</em>) because they have functional asplenia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for management approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite preventive measures to reduce the incidence of bacterial infections, such as immunizations and prophylactic antibiotics, children with SCD remain at risk for invasive bacterial infection. In the United States, the most common bacterial agents include <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>E. coli</em>, and <em>S. aureus</em>. In other parts of the world, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> is less frequently isolated, even in countries where universal pneumococcal vaccination is not available. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for management approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Empiric antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SCD and fever over 101.5&deg;F (38.5&deg;C) by history or measurement should be promptly evaluated by medical personnel knowledgeable about SCD. A brief history and physical examination focused upon identifying signs of systemic or localized infection, hemodynamic instability, and other manifestations of SCD such as acute chest syndrome should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory tests should be obtained promptly and include blood culture, complete blood count, and reticulocyte count. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the initial laboratory tests are obtained, we recommend prompt administration of empiric parenteral antibiotics in all patients with SCD and fever (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Selected antibiotics should be active against bacterial pathogens that are commonly found in the local community. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For empiric parenteral antibiotics, the following regimen is most commonly used in the United States:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ceftriaxone</a> as a single dose of 50 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> (maximum dose 2 g), the dose of which is increased (dose 75 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> maximum dose 2 g) in regions with a high prevalence of antibiotic resistant <em>S. pneumoniae</em>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who are hemodynamically unstable or suspected to have meningitis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> is added (dose 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, maximum dose 1 g).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are allergic to cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clindamycin</a> can be used (dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every six to eight hours; maximum daily dose 2.7 g for children; 4.8 g for adults). Most patients requiring this therapy should be admitted for observation due to the shorter half-life of this antibiotic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The identification of a localized infection does not alter the need for empiric parenteral antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further studies should be considered but should <strong>not</strong> delay the administration of antibiotics:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urinalysis and culture is done in children less than two years of age with fever and other patients with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest radiography is done only for physical exam findings consistent with pneumonia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid is obtained for analysis and culture only if there is a clinical suspicion for meningitis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A type and crossmatch is obtained if extreme pallor, severe pulmonary or neurologic symptoms, or significant acute increase in spleen size are present. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are more likely to have invasive bacterial infection should be hospitalized. We recommend that patients with SCD be admitted for inpatient care if they have several of the following risk factors for invasive bacterial infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>): (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Decision about admission'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age less than two years with hemoglobin SS (HbSS) or sickle cell-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia (HbS-&beta;<sup>0</sup> thalassemia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Temperature greater than 40&deg;C (104&deg;F)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>White cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;30,000/microL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;5000/microL</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemoglobin &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/dL</span> below steady state value</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Previous invasive bacterial infection particularly with <em>S. pneumoniae</em> &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Indwelling central venous line</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signs of systemic toxicity, meningitis, or hemodynamic instability</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other complications of SCD (eg, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration) are present that would benefit from inpatient management</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, other indications for hospitalization are treatment with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clindamycin</a> (because of their shorter half-life); concern about inability to contact the family or ability to reliably return if the culture becomes positive or the patient's condition worsens; and the presence of other complications of SCD (eg, pain requiring parenteral opioids) that require inpatient management. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Decision about admission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inpatient management includes initiation of hemodynamic monitoring, oxygen saturation monitoring, supportive care (if needed), continuation of empiric antibiotic therapy, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (age dependent), and readjustment of antibiotics when culture results are available.
