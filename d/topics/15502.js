The conduction disturbance can be transient or permanent, with conduction that is delayed, intermittent, or absent. Commonly used terminology includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First degree AV block &ndash; Delayed conduction from the atrium to the ventricle (defined as a prolonged PR interval of &gt;200 milliseconds) without interruption in atrial to ventricular conduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second degree AV block &ndash; Intermittent atrial conduction to the ventricle, often in a regular pattern (eg, 2:1, 3:2), or higher degrees of block, which are further classified into Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) and Mobitz type II second degree AV block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third degree (complete AV) block &ndash; No atrial impulses conduct to the ventricle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-grade AV block &ndash; Two or more consecutive blocked P waves.</p><p/><p>The clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of Mobitz type I second degree AV block will be reviewed here.

The prognosis is excellent in these settings, as progressive block does not appear to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block/abstract/4,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-8</a>]. Progression to third degree (complete) AV block has been reported in infants (occurring in 7 of 16 in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Sinus bradycardia and AV conduction abnormalities are often observed in well-trained endurance athletes. As an example, Mobitz type I second degree AV block has been described in 2 to 10 percent of long-distance runners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These findings may be related to increased parasympathetic activity associated with training (with a disappearance following detraining or after vagolytic or sympathetic maneuvers) or intrinsic AV nodal mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20201532\"><span class=\"h2\">Underlying heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mobitz type I second degree AV block can occur in patients with intrinsic AV nodal disease, myocarditis (including Chagas disease), acute inferior myocardial infarction or ischemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62040\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef62040 \">waveform 4</a>), and cardiac surgery. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the majority of patients (approximately 90 percent), the right coronary artery supplies blood to the AV node. Thus, Mobitz type I second degree AV block (due to ischemia of the AV node) can occur as a complication of an inferior myocardial infarction. The finding of Mobitz type I second degree AV block in a patient with an inferior myocardial infarction is associated with increased mortality, presumably due to larger infarct size. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conduction abnormalities after myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobitz type I second degree AV block, typically transient, has been described in approximately 3 percent of patients after mitral valve surgery and has been reported in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and after repair of ventricular septal defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobitz type I second degree AV block, can be induced by a Valsalva maneuver in patients with Chagas disease who do not have overt cardiac involvement. This may indicate early vagal dysfunction or involvement of the AV node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas heart disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mobitz type I second degree AV block usually occurs within the AV node, but may also reflect a delay elsewhere in the conduction system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63340 \">figure 1</a>). Mobitz type I second degree AV block can be observed in antegrade AV conduction, retrograde ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction across the AV node, or as part of exit block with ectopic and parasystolic pacemakers.</p><p>Regardless of the site involved, what follows is a sequence in which there is a gradually increasing PR interval, usually a gradually decreasing R-R interval, and eventually a non-conducted P wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73051\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73051 \">waveform 1</a>). The following factors are required for this sequence to occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A constant input &ndash; The constant input is usually the SA nodal pacemaker that gives rise to atrial depolarization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An area of increasing conduction delay and a non-conducted P wave &ndash; The PR interval is shortest in the first conducted P wave in the cycle and increases with each ensuing P wave. However, the largest <strong>absolute increase in delay</strong> occurs following the first P wave, a lesser increase in delay occurs following the second P wave, and so forth. The impulse eventually conducts very slowly and block occurs, resulting in a non-conducted P wave (no associated QRS complex). If the pause between the last conducted P wave and the first apparent QRS complex of the next cycle is very long, it may in fact be a junctional escape rather than a conducted P wave. Almost invariably, the second PR interval of the new cycle will be shorter than that of the last conducted P wave that preceded the block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An output with a decreasing interval &ndash; The output, in this case the QRS-QRS interval (more commonly called the R-R interval), usually decreases with each conducted P wave of the cycle. The shortening R-R interval results from the decreasing increment in delay of AV nodal conduction (eg, the PR interval of beat 1 in a cycle increases by 0.05 seconds [from 0.18 to 0.23], the PR interval of next beat increases by 0.03 seconds [from 0.23 to 0.26], etc). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grouped beating &ndash; The classic Wenckebach pattern occurs usually with ratios of 3:2, 4:3, or 5:4. This gives rise to a clustering of beats with decreasing R-R intervals that tends to repeat, although mixed ratios do occur fairly frequently. Conduction ratios of over 7:6 usually show an atypical pattern rather than the classic pattern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pause shorter than two input cycles &ndash; The R-R interval involving the non-conducted P wave is less than the summed R-R interval of any two previous cycles. This also results from the incremental conduction delay as the P wave that is not conducted is closer to the preceding QRS than any other in the cycle.</p><p/><p>Once conduction ratios exceed 6:5 or 7:6, the progressive increment in PR interval becomes unpredictable and the PR interval remains prolonged but constant. The most common explanation is that the sinus rate changes which, in turn, influences the PR interval through hemodynamic and autonomic effects. The PR interval is still longest in the conducted P wave before, and shortest after, the block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78766\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef78766 \">waveform 5</a>).</p><p>The site of the Mobitz type I second degree AV block is in the AV node in the vast majority of cases, with the remaining cases involving the His bundle, bundle branches, or fascicles.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiogram &ndash; The ECG cannot pinpoint with certainty the site of the Mobitz type I second degree AV block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Additionally, in contrast to Mobitz type II second degree AV block, which can frequently progress to third degree (complete) AV block, Mobitz type I second degree AV block most often involves the AV node and rarely progresses to complete heart block. The evaluation of all patients with suspected Mobitz type I second degree AV block includes a thorough history, including medications and recent changes in medications, along with a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and bloodwork (which includes serum electrolytes and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20201718\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with suspected Mobitz type I second degree AV block should be questioned about any history of heart disease, both congenital and acquired, as well as any recent cardiac procedures or medications that could predispose to AV conduction abnormalities. Patients without known cardiac disease should be questioned about other systemic diseases associated with heart block (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis). Patients who live in an area with endemic Lyme disease should be questioned about any recent outdoor exposure to ticks or known tick bites. (See <a href=\"#H20200945\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with suspected Mobitz type I second degree AV block that occurs in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia or infarction should undergo concurrent diagnosis and treatment for both conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conduction-abnormalities-after-myocardial-infarction#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conduction abnormalities after myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Management of AV block'</a>.)</p><p>Patients without known or suspected cardiac or systemic disease should be questioned about their level of athletic activities and fitness. Such patients should also provide a full list of medications and be questioned about any recent changes in dosing, with particular attention paid to drugs that alter AV nodal conduction (ie, beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, select antiarrhythmic drugs).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20201856\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with Mobitz type I second degree AV block are asymptomatic. Mobitz type I second degree AV block that occurs in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia or myocarditis may result in clinical deterioration if the resulting ventricular rate is inadequate to maintain cardiac output. Additionally, even in otherwise healthy patients, if the sinus rate is slow and there are fewer conducted beats (2:1 or 3:2 block), there may be a significant reduction in cardiac output resulting in symptoms of hypoperfusion (including fatigue, lightheadedness, syncope, presyncope, or angina) or heart failure.</p><p>Patients with Mobitz type I second degree AV block often present with bradycardia but may have a normal sinus rhythm rate. Additionally, other than the presence of an irregular pulse, there are few specific physical examination findings. Patients may appear pale or diaphoretic if they have bradycardia with a resultant reduction in cardiac output. Patients with underlying heart failure that is exacerbated by the development of heart block may have crackles on lung examination, elevated jugular venous pulsations, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20201863\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG findings and diagnostic maneuvers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mobitz type I second degree AV block is identified by progressive prolongation of the PR interval for several heart beats, followed by a non-conducted P wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73051\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73051 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p>Mobitz type I second degree AV block is distinguished from other types of AV block as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with first degree AV block have a PR interval that is prolonged (&gt;200 milliseconds) but constant, and each P wave is followed by a QRS interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67882\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67882 \">waveform 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Mobitz type II second degree AV block have a consistent unchanging PR intervals prior to a P wave that suddenly fails to conduct to the ventricles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58649\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef58649 \">waveform 2</a>). For patients with second degree AV block with a ratio of atrial to ventricular conduction that is not 2:1, Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II second degree AV block are easily distinguished. However, for patients with 2:1 atrial to ventricular conduction, the distinction between Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II second degree AV block cannot be made from the surface electrocardiogram (ECG).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with third degree (complete) AV block will have evidence of atrial (P waves) and ventricular (QRS complexes) activity that are independent of each other on the surface ECG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72863\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72863 \">waveform 3</a>). In rare instances, the atrial rate may be exactly twice the ventricular rate, resulting in apparent 2:1 AV block that can mimic second degree AV block.</p><p/><p>If 2:1 AV block is seen on the surface ECG, certain ECG features may aid in differentiating Mobitz type I from Mobitz type II second degree AV block. Additionally, because of the varying effects of vagal tone on sinus node, AV node, and His-Purkinje system properties, vagal maneuvers can identify the site of a conduction abnormality in patients with second degree AV block.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the PR interval of a conducted beat is very long (&gt;300 milliseconds) or the QRS complex is narrow, the level of block is more likely to be in the AV node, and the rhythm is most likely Mobitz type I second degree AV block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> is administered (typically 0.25 to 0.5 mg IV) and there is enhanced AV nodal conduction resulting in less frequent non-conducted P waves (ie, change from a 2:1 cycle to a 3:2 cycle), this confirms Mobitz type I second degree AV block. A lack of response to atropine is consistent with but not diagnostic for Mobitz type II second degree AV block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotid sinus massage, which increases vagal tone, would be expected to worsen Mobitz type I second degree AV block by slowing AV nodal conduction. An increased conduction defect (ie, higher-grade block) following carotid sinus massage, which increases vagal tone, implies that the AV node is the site of the abnormality and is consistent with Mobitz type I second degree AV block. Apparent improvement in AV conduction with the slowing of the sinus node rate (eg, restoration of 1:1 conduction) following carotid sinus massage suggests that the conduction abnormality is below the level of the AV node, consistent with Mobitz type II second degree AV block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagal-maneuvers#H80135632\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vagal maneuvers&quot;, section on 'Carotid sinus massage'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8023112\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiology study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrophysiology study (EPS) is not usually performed in patients with Mobitz type I second degree AV block. EPS is indicated in those patients with syncope or presyncope and 2:1 AV block when the etiology of 2:1 block cannot be discerned with noninvasive maneuvers. </p><p>When EPS is performed in such patients, there is typically a progressively longer A-H interval and a stable H-V interval until the final beat of the series in which there is an atrial electrogram with no subsequent His or ventricular electrogram. Less commonly, Mobitz type I second degree AV block is observed in the His-Purkinje system (HPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this instance, there will usually be two His potentials (H and H') due to the slowing of conduction, with the H-H' interval prolonging before the H' and subsequent QRS complex are absent with block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20201884\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In nearly all cases, the diagnosis of Mobitz type I second degree AV block can be made in a patient with an irregular pulse or suggestive symptoms (eg, fatigue, dyspnea, presyncope, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> syncope) by obtaining a surface electrocardiogram (ECG). </p><p>For patients with 2:1 AV block in whom the distinction between Mobitz type I and Mobitz type II second degree AV block cannot be made using the surface ECG alone, a long rhythm strip should be obtained or a previous ECG examined to try to find evidence of PR prolongation with non-conducted P waves in a pattern other than 2:1 (eg, 3:2, 4:3, etc). Additionally, carotid sinus massage may be performed, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> administered, to help distinguish the level of AV block. If the diagnosis remains uncertain following these measures, invasive electrophysiology studies can definitively diagnose the type of AV block and accurately identify the level of the block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of Mobitz type I second degree AV block depends on the presence and severity of any signs and symptoms related to the patient's rate and rhythm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F109617\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109617 \">algorithm 1</a>). Symptomatic patients should be treated with ventricular pacing (and, if hemodynamically unstable, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>) and undergo treatment of any associated potentially reversible causes (eg, myocardial ischemia). Conversely, asymptomatic patients with Mobitz type I second degree AV block do not require any specific therapy. Prior to initiating treatment for Mobitz type I second degree AV block, reversible causes of slowed conduction such a myocardial ischemia, increased vagal tone, and medications should be excluded.

In second degree AV block, some atrial impulses fail to reach the ventricles. In Mobitz type I second degree AV block, there is progressive PR interval prolongation for several beats preceding a non-conducted P wave, whereas in Mobitz type II second degree AV block, the PR interval remains unchanged prior to a P wave that suddenly fails to conduct to the ventricles. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H106314935\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobitz type I second degree AV block can occur in normal subjects and athletes without underlying cardiac pathology. The potential etiologies of Mobitz type I second degree AV block also include reversible (both pathologic and iatrogenic) and idiopathic causes that are similar to other degrees of AV block (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62885 \">table 1</a>). Common potentially reversible causes include certain medications, myocardial ischemia, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathies. (See <a href=\"#H20200945\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with suspected Mobitz type I second degree AV block should be questioned about any history of heart disease, both congenital and acquired, as well as any recent cardiac procedures or medications that could predispose to AV conduction abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H20201718\" class=\"local\">'Clinical history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with Mobitz type I second degree AV block are asymptomatic. Mobitz type I second degree AV block that occurs in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia or myocarditis may result in clinical deterioration if the resulting ventricular rate is inadequate to maintain cardiac output. Additionally, even in otherwise healthy patients, if the sinus rate is slow and there are fewer conducted beats (2:1 or 3:2 block), there may be a significant reduction in cardiac output resulting in symptoms of hypoperfusion (including fatigue, lightheadedness, syncope, presyncope, or angina) or heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H20201856\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobitz type I second degree AV block is identified by progressive prolongation of the PR interval for several heart beats, followed by a non-conducted P wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73051\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73051 \">waveform 1</a>). If 2:1 AV block is seen on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), certain ECG features (eg, PR interval &gt;300 milliseconds, narrow QRS complexes, etc) may aid in differentiating Mobitz type I from Mobitz type II second degree AV block. Additionally, because of the varying effects of vagal tone on sinus node, AV node, and His-Purkinje system properties, vagal maneuvers can identify the site of a conduction abnormality in patients with second degree AV block.
