Successful management of children with elevated ICP requires prompt recognition and therapy directed at both reducing ICP and reversing its underlying cause.

Measured ICP &gt;20 mmHg (27 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) for longer than five minutes with signs or symptoms is generally regarded as the threshold for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Occasional transient elevations may occur with physiologic events, including sneezing, coughing, or Valsalva maneuvers.

Furthermore, all of these interrelationships may be altered in critically ill comatose patients with any of the conditions that increase intracranial pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69683 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The anatomy and development of the cranial vault, the brain, and its vascular and CSF compartments also have an effect on ICP. The interrelationship between volume and compliance of each component of the intracranial compartment was recognized over 150 years ago and is known as the Monro-Kellie doctrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Because the overall volume of the cranial vault cannot change in the patient with closed cranial sutures, an increase in the volume of one component or the presence of pathologic components necessitates the displacement of other structures, an increase in ICP, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Taken together with the Davson equation, it is clear that ICP is affected by various pathologies including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenchymal brain swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial and vasogenic edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alterations in cerebral blood volume (CBV)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstruction of CSF outflow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal cerebral perfusion deficits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variable levels of CBF</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrovascular carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) reactivity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral vasculitis</p><p/><p>The net result of this pathophysiology is elevated ICP along with significant risk of brain tissue herniation, ischemic syndromes, and death.</p><p>This process is demonstrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65853\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65853 \">figure 1</a>). Normally, the intracranial components are in equilibrium. In a &ldquo;closed system&rdquo; (ie, closed sutures), initial compensation to increase in volume of a space-occupying lesion is by displacement of blood and CSF along the spinal axis, and ICP remains normal. When the limits of this compensation are reached; any additional increase in the volume of the mass lesion is accompanied by a corresponding increase in ICP (decompensated phase). The slope of the curve in the decompensated phase is steep, such that small changes in volume cause significant changes in ICP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54602 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In infants with open cranial sutures and a non-ossified fontanel, the system should be considered as &ldquo;open&rdquo; and initial compensation occurs with bulging at the anterior fontanel. In slowly progressive change in volume, head growth will be affected by splaying of the cranial sutures, as seen in hydrocephalus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3033295403\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebral perfusion pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is a clinical surrogate for the adequacy of cerebral perfusion. CPP is defined as mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus mean ICP.</p><p>CPP = MAP - ICP</p><p>Normal CPP in adults ranges from 50 to 70 mmHg; normal CPP in children younger than five years of age is probably lower than that in older children or adults, because children have lower systolic blood pressures, but normal limits have not been well established. However, based upon a normal ICP &lt;20 mmHg and MAP &gt;60 to 80 mmHg, depending upon age (where MAP = 1.5 x Age + 55 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]), normal CPP in children can be calculated to be at least 40 to 60 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. When CPP falls below a critical level, either from hypotension or from a markedly elevated ICP, the brain receives inadequate CBF, and ischemic injury can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebral blood flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When managing elevated ICP, the major goal is to maintain CBF. CBF is a function of the pressure drop across the cerebral circulation divided by the cerebrovascular resistance (CVR), as predicted by Ohm's law:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>CBF = (CAP - JVP) &divide; CVR</p></div></div><p>Where CAP is carotid arterial pressure, JVP is jugular venous pressure, and CVR is cerebrovascular resistance.</p><p>The following factors significantly impact CBF: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong><strong>)</strong> &ndash; PaO<sub>2</sub> has its most significant effects at levels below 50 mmHg, when it causes vasodilatation in an attempt to maintain the oxygen supply to the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO</strong><strong><sub>2</sub></strong><strong>)</strong> &ndash; Hypercapnia causes cerebral vasodilatation and increased CBF, whereas hypocapnia reduces CBF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Because the response to changes in PaCO<sub>2</sub> is rapid, hyperventilation is an emergency intervention as a temporizing measure before neurosurgery during the acute management of increased ICP complicated by impending transtentorial and tonsillar herniation of brain tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-management#H817226535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic hyperventilation'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoregulation</strong> &ndash; In the intact and normal cerebral circulation, CBF is maintained at a relatively constant rate by intrinsic cerebral mechanisms referred to as autoregulation. In addition to this global phenomenon, a region of brain tissue can also bring about an acute regional change in CBF. This coupling of local blood flow to local changes in metabolic activity is determined by a number of &quot;neuro-energetic&quot; signals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A clinical illustration of this phenomenon is by the blood oxygen level-dependent (&quot;BOLD&quot;) time series used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that can show &quot;activated&quot; regions with mental tasks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-management#H817226535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic hyperventilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At a global level, cerebral autoregulation adjusts CBF through changes in CVR. In adults, changes in CVR can maintain constant CBF at mean arterial pressures of 60 to 150 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, this &quot;plateau&quot; is under many influences including level of sympathetic activity and baseline PaCO<sub>2</sub>. In infants and children, the range of the plateau (with upper and lower limits) is going to differ to that identified in adults because of developmental differences in mean arterial pressure and level of sympathetic activity. Consequently, we do not know the precise lower limit in mean blood pressure at which CBF falls with declining blood pressure. Newer techniques, however, using near-infrared spectroscopy in babies with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy suggest that optimum mean arterial pressure can be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Outside this range, the compensatory mechanisms break down and inadequate or excessive perfusion can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. The upper and lower limits of autoregulation are shifted to the right in patients with chronic hypertension, such as patients with malignant hypertension and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, in whom acute reductions in blood pressure can produce ischemic symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57676\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57676 \">figure 3</a>). In addition, autoregulation may be impaired in the setting of neurologic injury, particularly in children, in whom rapid and severe brain swelling may result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

However, invasive measurement of ICP is reserved for the most severely affected children in whom the benefits of direct measurement outweigh the risks of bleeding and infection (eg, Glasgow coma score [GCS] &le;8 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662 \">table 10</a>) following head trauma or diagnosed with a condition that warrants aggressive treatment to manage ICP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In awake patients with findings that indicate subacute or chronic elevation of ICP (eg, headache, peripheral vision loss, and papilledema) but a nonfocal neurologic examination and normal neuroimaging, elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture (&gt;27 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) can establish the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri).

In infants with unfused sutures, progressive enlargement of the cranial vault due to increased ICP can be initially accommodated without major clinical decompensation. In older children, early symptoms such as headache or vomiting are nonspecific, and unless there is a high index of suspicion, as the course progresses, an altered level of consciousness may hinder the diagnosis.
