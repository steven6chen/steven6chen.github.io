Affected patients usually have portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or (less often) metastatic tumors, but can also have fulminant hepatic failure from any cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The hepatorenal syndrome represents the end-stage of a sequence of reductions in renal perfusion induced by increasingly severe hepatic injury. The hepatorenal syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and is associated with a poor prognosis.</p><p>This topic will review the hepatorenal syndrome in detail. Overviews of the complications of fulminant hepatic failure and cirrhosis are provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial vasodilatation in the splanchnic circulation, which is triggered by portal hypertension, appears to play a central role in the hemodynamic changes and the decline in renal function in cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The presumed mechanism is increased production or activity of vasodilators, mainly in the splanchnic circulation, with nitric oxide thought to be most important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>].</p><p>As the hepatic disease becomes more severe, there is a progressive rise in cardiac output and fall in systemic vascular resistance; the latter change occurs despite local increases in renal and femoral vascular resistance that result in part from hypotension-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74244 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1-3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,6</a>]. Thus, the reduction in total vascular resistance results from decreased vascular resistance in the splanchnic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], perhaps in part under the influence of nitric oxide derived from the endothelium. Bacterial translocation from the intestine into the mesenteric lymph nodes may play an important role in this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. A review of the hemodynamic changes seen with progressive cirrhosis can be found in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The decline in renal perfusion in this setting is associated with reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and sodium excretion (often to less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> in advanced cirrhosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] and a fall in mean arterial pressure, despite the intense renal vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The importance of splanchnic vasodilatation in these changes can be indirectly illustrated by the response to ornipressin, an analog of antidiuretic hormone (arginine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a>) that is a preferential splanchnic vasoconstrictor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In patients with advanced cirrhosis, the administration of ornipressin <strong>or</strong> other <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> analogs partially corrects many of the systemic and renal hemodynamic abnormalities that are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68506\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68506 \">figure 2</a>); these include an elevation in mean arterial pressure, reductions in plasma renin activity and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> concentration, and increases in renal blood flow, GFR (from 18 to 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> and urinary sodium excretion and volume.</p><p>In addition, acutely lowering renal sympathetic tone and renal vascular resistance in the early stages of hepatorenal syndrome by the intravenous administration of the sympatholytic agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, can raise the GFR by as much as 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, this benefit does not appear to be sustained with chronic oral therapy, despite a persistent reduction in sympathetic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The response to creation of a portasystemic shunt also supports the importance of splanchnic hemodynamics in the genesis of the hepatorenal syndrome. Portasystemic shunting has improved renal function in a limited number of patients with the hepatorenal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but it is infrequently used as treatment for this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One report, however, suggested that the reduction in intrahepatic pressure induced by this modality may <strong>prevent</strong> the development of the hepatorenal syndrome. This retrospective study evaluated 204 patients with variceal bleeding who were treated with either a portasystemic shunt or sclerotherapy (or other non-shunt modalities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Portasystemic shunting was associated with a lower incidence of ascites (15 versus 73 percent) and hepatorenal syndrome (4 versus 21 percent), a higher incidence of encephalopathy, and no difference in overall patient survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9884469\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who develop the hepatorenal syndrome usually have portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or, less often, metastatic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. However, patients with fulminant hepatic failure from any cause may develop hepatorenal syndrome.</p><p>The incidence of hepatorenal syndrome was evaluated in a prospective study of 229 nonazotemic patients with cirrhosis and ascites: the hepatorenal syndrome developed in 18 and 39 percent at one and five years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with hyponatremia and a high plasma renin activity were at highest risk. These signs of neurohumoral activation presumably reflected a more severe decline in effective perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p>Hepatorenal syndrome also occurs frequently in patients with acute liver disease. In a study of patients with alcoholic hepatitis, for example, hepatorenal syndrome occurred in 28 of 101 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Although hepatorenal syndrome can be seen in most forms of severe hepatic disease, patients with primary biliary cholangitis appear relatively protected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Sodium retention, ascites formation, and the hepatorenal syndrome all tend to occur less often in primary biliary cholangitis, possibly due in part to the natriuretic and renal vasodilator actions of retained bile salts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hepatorenal syndrome is characterized by the following features in a patient who has established or clinically evident acute or chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1-3,10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,10,19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A progressive rise in serum creatinine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An often normal urine sediment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No or minimal proteinuria (less than 500 mg per day)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A very low rate of sodium excretion (ie, urine sodium concentration less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oliguria</p><p/><p>However, not all patients with hepatorenal syndrome have oliguria (especially early in its course), a progressive rise in serum creatinine, and a benign urine sediment. Urine volumes may be higher than previously appreciated. Some studies, for example, have found that the urine volume may exceed 400 mL per day, with markedly lower output being observed only within a few days from death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In addition, the serum creatinine may increase by as little as 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (9 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> per day, with intermittent periods of stabilization or even slight improvement. Lastly, the urine sediment may show a variety of abnormalities, such as hematuria due to bladder instrumentation and underlying coagulopathy, and granular casts due to hyperbilirubinemia.</p><p>Based upon the rapidity of the decline in kidney function, two forms of hepatorenal syndrome have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1,19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome</strong> &ndash; Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome is the more serious type; it is defined as at least a twofold increase in serum creatinine (reflecting a 50 percent reduction in creatinine clearance) to a level greater than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> during a period of less than two weeks. At the time of diagnosis, some patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome have a urine output less than 400 to 500 mL per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Type 2 hepatorenal syndrome</strong> &ndash; Type 2 hepatorenal syndrome is defined as renal impairment that is less severe than that observed with type 1 disease.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, for example, can trigger progressive hepatorenal syndrome, although it is more likely to occur in patients who already have some degree of renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Albumin administration for patients with renal dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p>When type 1 hepatorenal syndrome results from bacterial infection, antibiotic therapy alone does <strong>not</strong> usually lead to improvement in renal function. In one study, for example, hepatorenal syndrome failed to improve in 47 of 70 patients (67 percent) treated with antibiotics alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome precipitated by infection should receive other therapies described below, particularly if renal function fails to improve after several days of antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Although overly rapid diuresis has often been mentioned as a precipitant of hepatorenal syndrome, perhaps because most patients are taking diuretics when the syndrome is diagnosed, diuretics do <strong>not</strong> cause hepatorenal syndrome. Diuretics can, however, cause azotemia, particularly if fluid is removed too rapidly in patients without peripheral edema. Diuretic-induced azotemia improves with the cessation of therapy and fluid repletion. In comparison, the hepatorenal syndrome typically worsens inexorably, even after diuretics are stopped. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ascites-in-adults-with-cirrhosis-initial-therapy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ascites in adults with cirrhosis: Initial therapy&quot;, section on 'Diuretic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17253448\"><span class=\"h2\">Problems with estimating kidney function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hepatorenal syndrome may have renal dysfunction that is substantially more severe than is suggested by the serum creatinine. Both urea and creatinine production may be substantially reduced in this setting, due to the liver disease and to decreased muscle mass and decreased protein and meat intake. The net effect is that a serum creatinine that appears to be within the normal range (eg, 1 to 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [88.4 to 115 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> may be associated with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that ranges from as low as 20 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> to a clearly normal value above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> depending primarily upon muscle mass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H20664189\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Using creatinine to estimate GFR'</a>.)</p><p>The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is variable in these patients. For a given GFR, it may be lower or higher than expected. If protein intake is very low, reduced urea production may result in a low BUN and a low BUN to creatinine ratio. In contrast, if protein intake is adequate, increased passive reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubule, driven by enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and water, can result in a high BUN and a high BUN to creatinine ratio. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatorenal syndrome is diagnosed based upon clinical criteria. There is no one specific test that can establish the diagnosis. Investigational urinary biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) tend to be lower in prerenal azotemia and hepatorenal syndrome than in acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but there is considerable overlap between these conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. In addition, hepatorenal syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other potential etiologies of acute or subacute kidney injury in patients with liver disease should be considered unlikely before a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is made.</p><p>The following definition and diagnostic criteria have been proposed for the hepatorenal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1,19,22,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19,22,30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic or acute hepatic disease with advanced hepatic failure and portal hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute kidney injury, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (26.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or more within 48 hours, or an increase from baseline of 50 percent or more within seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]; this definition of acute kidney injury is consistent with KDIGO criteria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging criteria of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>). However, some clinicians may prefer to use the older definition of acute or subacute kidney injury, specifically a rise in serum creatinine to above 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> that has progressed over days to weeks. As noted above, the rise in serum creatinine with reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may be minimal due to the marked reduction in creatinine production among such patients. (See <a href=\"#H17253448\" class=\"local\">'Problems with estimating kidney function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of any other apparent cause for the acute kidney injury, including shock, current or recent treatment with nephrotoxic drugs, and the absence of ultrasonographic evidence of obstruction or parenchymal renal disease. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is complicated by acute kidney injury that may be reversible in 30 to 40 percent of patients. It can be associated with ATN, but it is also a major precipitant of the hepatorenal syndrome. Thus, ongoing infection with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should not exclude the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome. This means that therapy for hepatorenal syndrome can commence while the bacterial infection is still being treated. In addition, hepatorenal syndrome can occur in patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Thus, the presence of another renal diagnosis (eg, diabetic nephropathy) does not necessarily exclude hepatorenal syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Albumin administration for patients with renal dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In conjunction with excluding other apparent causes of renal disease, the following criteria also apply:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urine red cell excretion of less than 50 cells per high power field (when no urinary catheter is in place) and protein excretion less than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lack of improvement in renal function after volume expansion with intravenous albumin (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of body weight per day up to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> for at least two days and withdrawal of diuretics.</p><p/><p>As noted above, patients diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome are classified as type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (more severe) or type 2 hepatorenal syndrome (less severe) based upon the rapidity of the acute kidney injury and the degree of renal impairment. Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome is present if the serum creatinine increases by at least twofold to a value greater than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> during a period of less than two weeks.

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both glomerulonephritis and vasculitis can occur in patients with liver disease and should be suspected in patients with an active urine sediment containing red cells and red cell and other casts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of renal disease associated with hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease associated with hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Obesity with fatty liver is a relatively common cause of cirrhosis. Many of these patients have diabetes and can develop diabetic nephropathy.

A prospective study from 2011 that analyzed 562 patients with cirrhosis and renal function impairment at a single center found that hepatorenal syndrome was less common than prerenal or infection-associated kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Of the 463 patients in this study in whom a diagnosis could be made, the following frequencies were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney injury associated with infection (such as sepsis or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) &ndash; 46 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prerenal acute kidney injury &ndash; 32 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatorenal syndrome &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenchymal renal disease (such as glomerulonephritis) &ndash; 9 percent</p><p/><p>The frequency of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in this study was not defined, although older case series report that 10 to 20 percent of patients with acute kidney injury in the setting of cirrhosis have ATN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. It is possible that ATN is less common now, due to avoidance of nephrotoxins such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aminoglycosides in these patients. In addition, some experts believe that some patients with ongoing infection (principally spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in the absence of septic shock) can have hepatorenal syndrome since a substantial proportion of such patients (18 percent in one report) have persistent or progressive kidney injury despite successful antibiotic therapy for peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, as mentioned above, the presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should not exclude the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome.</p><p>Kidney biopsy is not commonly performed in patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury, particularly when there is minimal hematuria and proteinuria. As an example, in a series of 65 patients with cirrhosis and renal disease who underwent transjugular kidney biopsy, only 18 patients had no proteinuria and no hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Of these 18 patients, glomerular lesions were identified in 10 (such as IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, or diabetic nephropathy), and ATN was identified in 7. Transjugular kidney biopsy, performed by an interventional radiologist, can be considered if the result may have an impact on treatment and if such treatment could outweigh the potential harms associated with the interventional procedure. Although there is a common misconception that the kidneys are histologically normal, a relatively specific but subtle and reversible renal lesion has been described&mdash;glomerular tubular reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Distinguishing the hepatorenal syndrome from these other disorders is clinically important because of the marked difference in prognosis. ATN and most causes of prerenal disease are generally reversible. In contrast, the prognosis is poor in the hepatorenal syndrome (especially type 1), with most patients dying within weeks of the onset of renal injury unless liver transplantation is performed or effective treatment is given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/10,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute tubular necrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cirrhosis may develop ATN after a course of aminoglycoside therapy, the administration of a radiocontrast agent, or an episode of sepsis or bleeding with a decrease in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The presence of ATN is usually suspected from the history and from the often rapid rise in the serum creatinine, which contrasts to the usually gradual rise in hepatorenal syndrome. An unresolved issue is whether the prolonged renal ischemia in the hepatorenal syndrome can, in some cases, lead to ATN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/1,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19</a>].</p><p>Some of the traditional laboratory methods used to distinguish prerenal disease from ATN may not be helpful in patients with hepatic disease. As an example, ATN is usually associated with a fractional excretion of sodium above 2 percent and granular and epithelial cell casts in the urine sediment.

The best data come from a trial that randomly assigned 49 patients to terlipressin (starting at 3 mg infused over 24 hours, titrated as needed to 12 mg over 24 hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midodrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midodrine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> (midodrine starting orally at 7.5 mg thrice daily and octreotide at 100 mcg subcutaneously thrice daily, increased as needed to 12.5 mg thrice daily and 200 mcg thrice daily, respectively); all patients also received intravenous albumin (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> on day 1, and then 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> thereafter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Also, the study did not treat to a target increase in blood pressure (see <a href=\"#H97745174\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above). As a result, studies are needed in which the midodrine dose is chosen to attain an increase in blood pressure comparable to terlipressin.</p><p>Although this head-to-head trial was small and unblinded, the previous trials of terlipressin in patients with hepatorenal syndrome compared the drug with albumin alone, placebo, or no therapy, rather than an active comparator. In a meta-analysis of these earlier trials, terlipressin therapy significantly reduced mortality compared with albumin alone or no therapy (54 versus 73 percent) and increased the proportion of patients who achieved reversal of hepatorenal syndrome (54 versus 11 percent), but it also increased the rate of cardiovascular adverse events (11 versus 0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>These data suggest that terlipressin therapy may improve renal function compared with other therapies and may reduce mortality compared with albumin alone or no therapy.

One report described 16 such patients, six of whom had severe hepatorenal syndrome (defined as a serum creatinine of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [220 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> or higher, or a creatinine clearance below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Within two weeks, there was an approximate doubling of the creatinine clearance with a proportionate reduction in the serum creatinine and an increase in urinary sodium excretion. Additional improvements in renal function occurred over the ensuing six to eight weeks. Only three patients failed to respond, all of whom died within six weeks after TIPS.</p><p>Another series evaluated seven patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome, defined as a doubling of the serum creatinine to more than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or a 50 percent reduction in creatinine clearance to below 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in less than two weeks, despite volume expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Insertion of a TIPS was associated with a gradual improvement in GFR (9 to 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> reductions in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, and, in most patients, a reduction in the activity of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems suggesting an improvement in systemic hemodynamics. The average survival following TIPS placement was approximately five months, which is longer than the expected survival of such patients.</p><p>Unfortunately, many patients with hepatorenal syndrome are too ill to undergo TIPS. In a study that devised a prediction model to determine survival following elective TIPS, those patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome have a predicted 90-day mortality following TIPS of at least 25 percent if cirrhosis is due to alcoholic or cholestatic liver disease and at least 80 percent if cirrhosis is due to other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. A prediction model scoring system based upon the survival of 231 patients who underwent elective TIPS was devised to predict survival after the procedure.</p><p>In addition, TIPS is associated with various complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in the rate of hepatic encephalopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A worsening of liver function (marked by a rise in serum bilirubin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bleeding complication due to the procedure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A risk of renal injury associated with intravenous contrast, which is often necessary, even if carbon dioxide is used as the main contrast agent</p><p/><p>Overall, these results suggest that, in selected patients with hepatorenal syndrome, TIPS may provide short-term benefit. Given the risks associated with this procedure (particularly the high incidence of encephalopathy), it should be considered only as a last resort in selected patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18565503\"><span class=\"h3\">Dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hepatorenal syndrome who progress to renal failure can be treated with dialysis, which is most commonly done when patients are awaiting a liver transplant or when there is the possibility of improvement in liver function. In addition, dialysis improves the priority score for the transplant in the United States. In two retrospective studies, 30 to 50 percent of transplant candidates who developed acute kidney injury requiring dialysis survived to liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>].</p><p>Survival on dialysis is generally limited by the severity of the hepatic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], as well as concurrent respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Patients with an acute and potentially reversible hepatic insult may particularly benefit from dialysis since renal function will recover in parallel with improving hepatic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. By contrast, cirrhotic patients who develop hepatorenal syndrome and require dialysis have a dismal prognosis unless they are listed for liver transplant. In one study, for example, mortality at six months was 84 percent (median survival, 21 days) among such patients not listed for transplant but was 39 percent in patients listed for liver transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Hemodialysis is frequently difficult to perform in patients with hepatorenal syndrome since decompensated hepatic function is associated with hemodynamic instability. Some success has been realized with continuous renal replacement modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

None of these approaches are consistently associated with benefit, and therefore none are recommended.

In these settings, the increase in fluid return to the cardiopulmonary circulation can lead sequentially to decreased activity of sodium-retaining and vasoconstrictive mechanisms (such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system), a marked rise in urinary sodium excretion, and a modest elevation in GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/35,78,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,78,81</a>].</p><p>However, it is now rarely used because of an appreciable rate of complications and the lack of evidence that peritoneovenous shunting prolongs patient survival, which may be several years in patients with normal or near-normal hepatic and renal function tests but less than six weeks in patients with the hepatorenal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/35,79,80,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,79,80,83,84</a>].</p><p>The major problem with the peritoneovenous shunt is the relatively high rate of complications, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (due to entry into the blood stream of endotoxin or other procoagulant material in the ascitic fluid), infection of the shunt, which can lead to bacteremia, variceal bleeding resulting from volume expansion and a concurrent rise in portal venous pressure, and small bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/78,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,85,86</a>].</p><p>The net effect is that the perioperative mortality can reach 25 percent in patients with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatorenal-syndrome/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>].

Affected patients usually have portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or (less often) metastatic tumors, but can also have fulminant hepatic failure from any cause. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial vasodilatation in the splanchnic circulation, which is triggered by portal hypertension, appears to play a central role in the hemodynamic changes and the decline in renal function in the hepatorenal syndrome. The presumed mechanism is increased production or activity of vasodilators, mainly in the splanchnic circulation, with nitric oxide thought to be most important. As the hepatic disease becomes more severe, there is a progressive rise in cardiac output and fall in systemic vascular resistance; the latter change occurs despite local increases in renal and femoral vascular resistance that result in part from hypotension-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74244 \">figure 1</a>).

However, patients with fulminant hepatic failure from any cause may develop hepatorenal syndrome. In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, the hepatorenal syndrome occurs in approximately 20 and 40 percent at one and five years, respectively. In patients with acute liver disease, the hepatorenal syndrome occurs in approximately 25 to 30 percent. (See <a href=\"#H9884469\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hepatorenal syndrome is usually characterized by the following features in a patient who has established or clinically evident acute or chronic liver disease (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A progressive rise in serum creatinine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A benign urine sediment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No or minimal proteinuria (less than 500 mg per day)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A very low rate of sodium excretion (ie, urine sodium concentration less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oliguria</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based upon the rapidity of the decline in kidney function, two forms of hepatorenal syndrome have been described (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome &ndash; Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome is the more serious type; it is defined as at least a twofold increase in serum creatinine (reflecting a 50 percent reduction in creatinine clearance) to a level greater than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> during a period of less than two weeks. At the time of diagnosis, some patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome have a urine output less than 400 to 500 mL per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 2 hepatorenal syndrome &ndash; Type 2 hepatorenal syndrome is defined as renal impairment that is less severe than that observed with type 1 disease. The major clinical feature in patients with type 2 hepatorenal syndrome is ascites that is resistant to diuretics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of renal failure is typically insidious but can be precipitated by an acute insult, such as bacterial infection (often spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) or gastrointestinal bleeding. Diuretics do not cause hepatorenal syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H5670964\" class=\"local\">'Precipitants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hepatorenal syndrome may have renal dysfunction that is substantially more severe than is suggested by the serum creatinine. (See <a href=\"#H17253448\" class=\"local\">'Problems with estimating kidney function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatorenal syndrome is diagnosed based upon clinical criteria. There is no one specific test that can establish the diagnosis. The following definition and diagnostic criteria have been proposed for the hepatorenal syndrome (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic or acute hepatic disease with advanced hepatic failure and portal hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute kidney injury, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (26.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or more within 48 hours, or an increase from baseline of 50 percent or more within seven days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The absence of any other apparent cause for the acute kidney injury, including shock, current, or recent treatment with nephrotoxic drugs, and the absence of ultrasonographic evidence of obstruction or parenchymal renal disease. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is complicated by acute kidney injury that may be reversible in 30 to 40 percent of patients. It can be associated with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but it is also a major precipitant of the hepatorenal syndrome. Thus, ongoing infection with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should not exclude the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome. This means that therapy for hepatorenal syndrome can commence while the bacterial infection is still being treated. In addition, hepatorenal syndrome can occur in patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease. Thus, the presence of another renal diagnosis (eg, diabetic nephropathy) does not necessarily exclude hepatorenal syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In conjunction with excluding other apparent causes of renal disease, the following criteria also apply:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Urine red cell excretion of less than 50 cells per high power field (when no urinary catheter is in place) and protein excretion less than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Lack of improvement in renal function after volume expansion with intravenous albumin (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of body weight per day up to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> for at least two days and withdrawal of diuretics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As noted above, patients diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome are classified as type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (more severe) or type 2 hepatorenal syndrome (less severe) based upon the rapidity of the acute kidney injury and the degree of renal impairment. Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome is present if the serum creatinine increases by at least twofold to a value greater than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> during a period of less than two weeks. Less rapidly progressive disease is classified as type 2. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of the hepatorenal syndrome is one of <strong>exclusion</strong>, entertained only after other potential causes of acute or subacute kidney injury have been ruled out. Alternate etiologies include, but are not limited to, glomerulonephritis, prerenal disease, and ATN. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ideal therapy for hepatorenal syndrome is improvement of liver function from either recovery of alcoholic hepatitis, treatment of decompensated hepatitis B with effective antiviral therapy, recovery from acute hepatic failure, or liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H97745174\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H97745161\" class=\"local\">'Improving hepatic function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, when improvement of liver function is not possible in the short term, medical therapy should be instituted in an attempt to reverse the acute kidney injury associated with hepatorenal syndrome.

(See <a href=\"#H5672740\" class=\"local\">'Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who fail to respond to the above therapies, develop severely impaired renal function, are not considered candidates for TIPS, and either are candidates for liver transplantation or have a reversible form of liver injury and are expected to survive, we recommend dialysis as a bridge to liver transplantation or liver recovery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Hemodialysis is frequently difficult to perform in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, and survival is generally limited by the severity of the hepatic failure, as well as concurrent respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H18565503\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of medical therapy or TIPS in patients with hepatorenal syndrome is reversal of the acute kidney injury. In addition, when patients are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>, terlipressin, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midodrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midodrine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>, an immediate goal of therapy is to raise the mean arterial pressure by approximately 10 to 15 mmHg. (See <a href=\"#H97745174\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a>, terlipressin, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>, we usually treat for a total of two weeks. However, we and others occasionally treat for longer durations (up to one month or more) if there is some but not complete improvement in renal function after two weeks of therapy. In patients who respond to therapy, we occasionally treat indefinitely with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midodrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midodrine</a> to maintain a higher mean arterial pressure (or until liver transplantation or resolution of liver injury). In contrast, if a patient has no improvement in renal function after two weeks, therapy with these drugs can be considered futile. (See <a href=\"#H97745174\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following therapies may prevent the development of hepatorenal syndrome in these patients (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, we recommend the administration of intravenous albumin (1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> at the time of diagnosis of infection and another dose of albumin (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> on day 3 of antibiotic treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In selected patients with cirrhosis and ascites, we recommend chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a> therapy (400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). A discussion of which patients should receive chronic norfloxacin therapy, as well as the evidence for this graded recommendation, are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Without therapy, most patients with hepatorenal syndrome die within weeks of the onset of the renal impairment. The outcome of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, as well as recovery of kidney function, is strongly dependent upon reversal of the hepatic failure, whether spontaneous, following medical therapy, or following successful liver transplantation.
