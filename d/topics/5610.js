This technique has been used for studying most of the major fetal circulatory systems, including the umbilical artery (UA), umbilical vein, aorta, heart, and middle cerebral artery. Doppler sonography provides a unique opportunity to investigate human fetal hemodynamics and to use these findings for fetal surveillance. </p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical use of Doppler sonography of the umbilical artery for fetal surveillance. In pregnancies complicated by placental insufficiency, meta-analyses of randomized trials have shown that fetal umbilical artery Doppler is an effective test for improving perinatal mortality and morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The basic principles and safety of Doppler sonography in pregnancy are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-safety-of-diagnostic-ultrasound-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology#H943277491\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and safety of diagnostic ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology&quot;, section on 'Doppler'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DOPPLER WAVEFORM ANALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler ultrasound waveforms reflect blood velocity; therefore, they potentially can yield information on various aspects of blood flow in a circulation, including the presence and direction of flow, velocity profile, volume of flow, and impedance to flow. In perinatal practice, Doppler of the umbilical artery has been used extensively for assessing downstream circulatory impedance (ie, resistance to pulsatile flow).</p><p>Doppler waveform analysis is usually based upon the following characteristics of the maximum frequency shift envelope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73657\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73657 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peak systolic frequency shift value (S)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End-diastolic frequency shift value (D)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Average frequency shift value over the cardiac cycle (A)</p><p/><p>These three values are used to develop indices that measure the pulsatility of the Doppler waveform reflecting the dynamic changes in the circulation through the cardiac cycle. A Doppler index (DI) is calculated as a ratio and is, therefore, virtually independent of the angle of insonation, thus obviating the need for measuring the angle.</p><p>The most common Doppler indices used for obstetrical applications are the peak systolic frequency shift to end-diastolic frequency shift ratio, <span class=\"nowrap\">(S/D)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and the resistance index (RI), which represents the difference between the peak systolic and end-diastolic shift divided by the peak systolic shift [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The interobserver and intraobserver variances for the <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> ratio are 9.8 and 11.1 percent, respectively, and for the RI, 4 and 8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The pulsatility index (PI = <span class=\"nowrap\">S-D/A)</span> is also used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors affecting the waveform</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy complications such as fetal growth restriction (FGR) and preeclampsia, which are characterized by rising impedance in the fetoplacental vascular bed (see below), show a decline in the end-diastolic velocity and an increase in Doppler indices. This is the basis for the use of Doppler indices for fetal surveillance. However, several other factors can also affect the waveform: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gestational age</strong> &mdash; The end-diastolic velocity increases with advancing gestation, which is consistent with the progressive decline in fetoplacental blood flow impedance from fetal and placental vascular and hemodynamic changes. This is reflected by the continuing decline in the <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> ratio and RI as pregnancy advances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68103\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68103 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fetal heart rate</strong> &mdash; The fetal heart rate can effect Doppler indices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, within the normal limits of the fetal heart rate (120 to 160 bpm), the changes in the Doppler indices are not significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fetal breathing and hiccup </strong>&mdash; Substantial changes in intrathoracic pressure and central hemodynamics occur during fetal breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or hiccup. These changes produce dynamic variability in the Doppler waveform and, therefore, in the Doppler indices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F116125\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116125 \">image 2</a>). Therefore, Doppler interrogation of the UA should only be performed during fetal apnea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fetal movement</strong> &ndash; Fetal movements generate Doppler signals from sources extraneous to the umbilical blood flow and also interfere with stable Doppler interrogation of the umbilical artery. Therefore the Doppler examination should be performed when the fetus is not moving.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technical factors</strong> &mdash; Technical factors that affect waveform analysis include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Location where the cord is sampled</strong> &mdash; The indices are higher at the fetal than at the placental end of the cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For PW Doppler, a mid-level free floating loop of the cord should be used for sampling when the site of Doppler sampling can be selected. Others recommend using the fetal end of the umbilical cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The clinical significance of these variations in measurement technique remains unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Angle of insonation</strong> &ndash; The angle between the Doppler ultrasound beam path (as indicated by cursor line in the two dimensional image) and the axis of the blood vessel will affect the Doppler frequency shift and therefore the size of the waveform. The higher the angle, the smaller the waveform. Although the Doppler indices are almost completely angle independent, it is preferable to keep the angle of insonation as close to zero as possible (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Wall filter setting</strong> &ndash; The wall filter removes high amplitude low frequency Doppler signals generated by the vascular wall movements from the total Doppler flow signals. However, a higher filter setting may also remove low frequency umbilical artery flow signals during the end diastole. Therefore, the wall filter should be kept as low as achievable for the specific ultrasound device.</p><p/><p>Indices do not appear to be affected by fetal behavioral states (sleep-wake cycles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CORRELATION BETWEEN DOPPLER, ANATOMIC, AND CLINICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analysis of Doppler waveforms from an arterial source yields information about downstream impedance to flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The Doppler indices (DI) worsen with increasing pathology of the fetoplacental vascular system.</p><p>Abnormal fetal placental angiogenesis characterized by sparse, elongated, uncoiled, and less ramified terminal capillary loops, as well as other histological changes, are seen in pregnancies complicated by growth restriction and abnormal umbilical arterial Doppler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Furthermore, in pregnancies with growth-restriction and absent or reversed end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery, a significant down-regulation of placental NRP-1 expression has been demonstrated, suggesting impaired molecular mechanisms that promote branching angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These observations suggest fetoplacental vascular maldevelopment results in an increase in impedance that is reflected in the abnormal Doppler waveforms and indices. Embolization studies in sheep fetuses have shown that an increase in the umbilical artery Doppler index becomes apparent only when the flow is substantially reduced. Obliteration of 50 to 70 percent of terminal villi is associated with absent or reversed end-diastolic flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A change in the Doppler waveform precedes any changes in the fetal heart rate patterns, even with progressive metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Obstetrical complications, such as FGR and preeclampsia, result in chronic fetal nutritive and respiratory deprivation. As the stress intensifies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lengthens, the fetus mobilizes defensive responses that include preferential preservation of fetal growth over placental growth, changes in fetal movement pattern, deceleration of the fetal growth rate, and, eventually, chronic hypoxia and acidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56906\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56906 \">figure 2</a>). The primary fetal hemodynamic response to this deprivation involves redistribution of blood flow to the brain, heart, adrenals, and placenta at the expense of flow to muscles, viscera, skin, and other less critical tissues and organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Changes in blood flow impedance in the fetal regional circulations underlie this phenomenon. Doppler ultrasound demonstrates these circulatory changes associated with fetal compromise and allows perinatal prognostication.</p><p>The sequence of changes in fetal heart rate, Doppler findings, and other biophysical parameters during progressive fetal compromise reflect the fetal homeostatic response to chronic hypoxia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56906\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56906 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Abnormal elevation of Doppler indices precedes loss of fetal heart rate variability and reactivity, eventually leading to decline and loss of fetal breathing and body movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Reversed end diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery, absent or reversed atrial wave in the ductus venosus, and rapid loss of heart rate variability portend a poor outcome. Agonal signs and death occur if there are no interventions. Although the occurrence of this sequential progression pattern has been challenged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], the temporal sequence of hemodynamic deterioration from umbilical to cerebral to ductus venosus circulations has been demonstrated in over 70 percent of fetuses with early-onset growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This pattern of progression provides the basis for determining the sequence of fetal testing in clinical practice. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">AEDV AND REDV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The end-diastolic component of the Doppler waveform is crucial for assessing fetal well-being. Absence of end-diastolic flow velocity (AEDV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73059\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73059 \">image 3</a>) or reversal of end-diastolic flow velocity (REDV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F116297\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116297 \">image 4</a>) is associated with markedly adverse perinatal outcome, particularly a high perinatal mortality rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70766\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70766 \">table 1</a>) with a higher prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities (especially trisomy 13, 18, and 21) and congenital anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64316\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64316 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-31</a>]. These associations are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A European multicenter study involving 245 fetuses with AEDV or REDV reported a perinatal mortality rate of 28 percent, and 96 to 98 percent of the infants required intensive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The risk of cerebral hemorrhage, anemia, and hypoglycemia was also increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review including 1126 cases of AEDV and REDV reported in the literature calculated a stillbirth rate of 170 per 1000 and neonatal mortality rate of 280 per 1000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Most of the deaths were related to growth restriction, prematurity, fetal anomalies, and aneuploidy. The perinatal mortality rate corrected for congenital malformations and chromosomal abnormalities was approximately 340 per 1000 births.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective observational study including 113 pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction examined the relationship between neurodevelopmental outcome at age 2 and umbilical artery Doppler, ductus venosus Doppler, middle cerebral artery Doppler, as well as the biophysical profile score and several other indicators. Only reverse flow in the umbilical artery, gestational age, and birth weight independently predicted neurodevelopmental delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>The frequency of AEDV is approximately 2 percent in well-defined high risk pregnancies and may be as low as 0.3 percent in a general obstetrical population. AEDV may improve over time, although often only transiently, and days to weeks may elapse before the fetus shows additional evidence of compromise, especially in preterm pregnancies. Thus, this finding is not necessarily an immediate indication for delivery in pregnancies before 34 weeks if fetal surveillance tests, such as the nonstress test or biophysical profile, are reassuring (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines for clinical practice'</a> below). Although delivery after 32 completed weeks of gestation has been recommended, there are continuing concerns about prematurity risks before 34 completed weeks of gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Twenty randomized clinical trials on UA Doppler sonography involving a total population of 24,779 women have been reported. These trials have been reviewed elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Most of the trials were performed in high risk pregnancies and showed improved outcome despite inadequate sample size for a single study, heterogeneity in the patient population, study design, and study objectives. Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews of these trials have been performed. The most recent Cochrane review of 19 trials involving 10,225 women found a 29 percent decline in perinatal mortality, which was statistically significant (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This meant that 203 high risk pregnancies needed to be treated to prevent one perinatal death. Additional benefits included fewer inductions and cesarean deliveries. This evidence of clinical effectiveness makes umbilical Doppler unique among fetal surveillance tests. </p><p>The benefit of Doppler surveillance primarily pertained to pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction or preeclampsia. It may also be useful for fetal surveillance in twin gestations complicated by growth restriction, discordancy, or monochorionicity. Well-designed trials in other populations are needed.</p><p>In contrast to high risk pregnancies, trials of UA Doppler as a screening test in low risk pregnancies did <strong>not</strong> show any improvement in pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As an example, a multicenter French randomized trial in 4187 low risk pregnant mothers failed to observe any improvements in the outcome with routine UA Doppler sonography between 28 and 34 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Some authors have also questioned the efficacy of UA Doppler indices in term and near-term pregnancies. In these pregnancies, fetal flow redistribution as reflected by the middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler indices and the cerebroplacental ratio (CPR = MCA pulsatility <span class=\"nowrap\">index/UA</span> pulsatility index) may be superior to UA Doppler indices alone in predicting adverse perinatal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. We do not recommend using MCA Doppler indices or CPR to guide decisions about delivery timing as there is no compelling evidence of their effectiveness in improving perinatal outcome. By comparison, a practice guideline from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists&nbsp;recommends using MCA Doppler indices to guide the timing of the delivery in the term small for gestational age fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principles of managing a high risk pregnancy utilizing UA Doppler velocimetry in conjunction with other fetal surveillance test findings are described below. These recommendations are based upon current evidence and should be used to guide patient management with individualization of care as dictated by the specific clinical circumstance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79980\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79980 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Umbilical artery Doppler assessment is most useful in pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertensive diseases. Doppler velocimetry is recommended as a primary surveillance tool for monitoring these pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Doppler investigation identifies the fetal cardiovascular response to progressive hypoxia and acidosis and assists in discriminating small, but constitutionally normal, fetuses from those compromised by placental insufficiency. The use of Doppler in management of pregnancies complicated by FGR is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Doppler velocimetry'</a>.)</p><p>Umbilical artery Doppler is also used in surveillance of twin pregnancies, especially in the setting of discordant twin growth and twin transfusion syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be counseled regarding the relevant aspects of the test. She is placed in a semi-recumbent position, with lateral tilt to avoid maternal inferior vena caval compression. The wall filter settings for pulsed Doppler are kept at the lowest level (approximately 50 to 100 Hz) to prevent any false depiction of low or absent end-diastolic flow. An initial ultrasound examination is performed to confirm that the fetus is not active, breathing, or hiccupping, and to identify a free-floating loop of cord for sampling. Color Doppler may assist in identifying the sampling site. Waveforms obtained near the placental end of the cord reflect downstream resistance and thus have higher end-diastolic flow velocity than waveforms obtained near the abdominal cord insertion.<sup>&nbsp;</sup>To optimize reproducibility, some experts suggest interrogating the umbilical artery at the abdominal cord insertion, 1 cm from the fetal abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The Doppler cursor line should be aligned with the vessel axis with the angle of insonation as close to zero as possible. The Doppler sample volume is then placed in the vascular lumen encompassing it and the waveforms are recorded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87280\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef87280 \">movie 1</a>). The peak systolic and end diastolic frequency shifts are then identified with cursors and the Doppler indices are generated. Many devices can semi-automatically generate the indices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An <span class=\"nowrap\">S/D</span> ratio &gt;3.0 or RI &gt;0.6 at &ge;28 weeks of gestation is the best threshold for identifying pregnancies at high risk of adverse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The utility of this technique before 28 weeks for fetal surveillance in high risk pregnancies remains investigational. </p><p>A gestational age-specific nomogram may also be used, although such nomograms have not been standardized. In general, a Doppler index &gt;95<sup>th</sup> centile for the gestational age should be considered nonreassuring. An initially high Doppler index may progressively decline with advancing gestation, signifying an improved prognosis. In contrast, a rising UA Doppler index may indicate worsening fetal prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The most important diagnostic characteristic of the UA Doppler waveform is the state of the end diastolic velocity. As discussed above, AEDV is an ominous finding and should indicate delivery in pregnancies beyond 34 completed weeks. REDV has an even worse prognosis and should be interpreted as a preterminal finding. We feel its presence should indicate immediate delivery as early as 32 completed weeks of gestation. These principles are discussed in detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Management with normal Doppler indices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High risk pregnancies (eg, FGR or preeclampsia) with a Doppler index that remains normal or is not progressively rising should be followed with weekly Doppler evaluation. Either the nonstress test (NST) or biophysical profile (BPP) can be used as a backup test or simultaneously with the UA Doppler. We prefer the latter approach, as fetal compromise involves response from many fetal systems that may be more amenable to multimodal fetal surveillance.</p><p>Fetal monitoring should be intensified if there is a worsening of the clinical status (eg, progressive restriction of growth or severity of preeclampsia), and appropriate obstetrical intervention according to the existing standards of practice should be implemented. If the fetal and the maternal evaluations remain reassuring, the pregnancy may continue to 38 to 40 weeks, at which time delivery should occur. Growth restricted pregnancies should not continue beyond 40 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Management with abnormal Doppler indices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The obstetrical management when the Doppler index is abnormal depends upon the severity of the Doppler abnormality, severity of the underlying obstetrical complication, and the duration of gestation. Fetal malformations and aneuploidy are additional factors; management should be individualized in their presence. The following algorithm represents our approach for using UA Doppler in conjunction with other modalities of fetal surveillance for managing fetal growth restriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79980\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79980 \">algorithm 1</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high or increasing Doppler index in the presence of end-diastolic flow warrants more intensive fetal surveillance, such as weekly umbilical Doppler ultrasound and once or twice per week NST, BPP, or modified BPP, as dictated by the clinical condition. If fetal surveillance tests indicate fetal compromise (eg, nonreactive NST, poor fetal heart rate baseline variability, persistent late decelerations, oligohydramnios, or BPP score &lt;4), delivery should be strongly considered, with the mode of delivery determined by obstetrical factors (eg, gestational age, presentation, fetal heart rate tracing) and maternal factors (eg, medical complications, cervical status).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AEDV or REDV is associated with increased likelihood of poor perinatal outcome. Therefore, an urgent clinical response is indicated.</p><p/><p>The specific management of severe Doppler index abnormalities depends upon the gestational age. The optimal timing for delivery in early preterm pregnancies with abnormal UA Doppler index remains uncertain. One trial involving high risk early preterm pregnancies failed to resolve this issue, as no significant differences were noted in the deaths before discharge from the hospital between early versus delayed delivery groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In a follow-up study, no important differences in mortality or in the developmental assessment were seen at or beyond two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, a difference in disability was observed in gestations below 31 weeks of gestation at randomization, which prompted the investigators to caution against delivering before 30 weeks. </p><p>Even in the presence of AEDV, it is imperative to exercise caution before intervening at very early gestational ages. As an example, in a retrospective cohort study of 16 fetuses with growth restriction and AEDV at 20 to 23 weeks of gestation, diastolic velocity improved over two to four weeks and became normal by 27 weeks of gestation in four (25 percent) fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Compared to fetuses with persistent AEDV, these fetuses were delivered later in gestation (30 to 36 weeks versus 24 to 30 weeks) and had higher birthweight (1100 to 1750 g versus 408 to 951 g). </p><p>We believe the presence of REDV at any gestational age beyond 32 weeks should prompt consideration for immediate delivery. This is supported by Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine guidelines, which recommend intense fetal surveillance of these fetuses and continuing expectant management until 32 weeks as long as fetal surveillance remains reassuring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The value of ductus venosus Doppler remains equivocal, although its use appears to improve the prediction of stillbirth and acidemia when umbilical arterial Doppler has identified the fetus at risk. A randomized trial involving fetuses with very preterm growth restriction demonstrated a threefold decrease in the long term neuroimpairment in two year olds with significantly elevated umbilical artery Doppler indices in utero when late ductal changes were utilized for intervention; however, this also resulted in a slight increase in the perinatal deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/doppler-ultrasound-of-the-umbilical-artery-for-fetal-surveillance/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-growth-restriction-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal growth restriction: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, cesarean delivery is a reasonable choice in most cases of AEDV, as fetal tolerance to labor is poor in this situation. Cesarean delivery is clearly indicated in the presence of REDV or ominous fetal monitoring findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical artery (UA) provides a noninvasive measure of the fetoplacental hemodynamic state. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Doppler waveform analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>UA Doppler indices indirectly reflect impedance of downstream circulation. Abnormality of the Doppler index has been correlated to fetoplacental vascular maldevelopment. There is a significant association between abnormal Doppler indices and fetal hypoxia, fetal acidosis, and adverse perinatal outcome. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Correlation between Doppler, anatomic, and clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A peak systolic frequency shift to end-diastolic frequency shift <span class=\"nowrap\">(S/D)</span> ratio &gt;3.0 or resistance index (RI) &gt;0.6 at &ge;28 weeks of gestation is the best threshold for identifying pregnancies at high risk of adverse outcome. A gestational age-specific nomogram of UA Doppler indices may also be used. In general, a Doppler index &gt;95<sup>th</sup> centile for the gestational age should be considered nonreassuring. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Clinical interpretation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systematic reviews of randomized trials of UA Doppler ultrasound show improved outcome, especially significantly reduced stillbirths, when this technique is used in pregnancies complicated by growth restriction or hypertensive diseases. We recommend using UA Doppler as the primary fetal monitoring modality in these high-risk pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical effectiveness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical management should integrate the Doppler approach with existing modalities of antepartum fetal monitoring. The most important diagnostic characteristic of the UA Doppler waveform is the state of the end diastolic velocity: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For pregnancies with suspected fetal growth restriction, umbilical artery Doppler studies should be performed weekly to assess for fetal deterioration. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Management with normal Doppler indices'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absent end-diastolic velocity (AEDV) is an ominous finding and reversed end-diastolic velocity (REDV) should be interpreted as a preterminal finding. In pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction or preeclampsia, we recommend prompt delivery rather than expectant management in the setting of AEDV at &ge;34 weeks and REDV at &ge;30 weeks.
