It is not caused by viruses or parasites; by convention, infections due to these organisms are included in the term &quot;uveitis&quot; (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV] retinitis, toxoplasma chorioretinitis). Most cases of endophthalmitis are exogenous, resulting from inoculation of organisms from the outside, via trauma, eye surgery, or as an extension of keratitis (corneal infection). In such cases, the aqueous humor may be seeded first before extension into the vitreous. The remaining cases are endogenous, resulting from bacteremic or fungemic seeding of the eye. In endogenous endophthalmitis, organisms usually seed the highly vascular choroid first then extend anteriorly into the vitreous.</p><p>Most cases of endophthalmitis are due to bacteria and present acutely. Acute bacterial endophthalmitis is a vision-threatening condition and must be managed as an emergency. The clinical outcome depends upon both the virulence of the infecting organism and the speed with which appropriate therapy is initiated.</p><p>Bacterial endophthalmitis can be divided into several categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute postcataract surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pseudophakic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postintravitreal injection (eg, after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] injections)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleb related</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posttraumatic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endogenous</p><p/><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis will be reviewed here. Fungal endophthalmitis is discussed separately.

This complication occurs within six weeks of cataract surgery, with 75 percent of cases presenting in the first postoperative week.</p><p>Series from the 1990s noted an incidence of endophthalmitis of 0.1 to 0.2 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>], whereas a nationwide prospective study in Sweden from 2002 to 2004 found a somewhat lower incidence of 0.05 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Despite the low rate, endophthalmitis represents an important clinical problem since over two million cataract operations are performed annually in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vitreous is much more susceptible than the aqueous humor to infection by exogenously introduced bacteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57690 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Cataract surgery, which is performed through the anterior chamber, often results in transient bacterial contamination of the aqueous by the patient's conjunctival flora.</p><p>Several studies have shown that bacteria can be isolated from the anterior chamber at the end of cataract surgery in 7 to 43 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The organism burden in the aqueous is usually low, as demonstrated by quantitative cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. None of the study patients developed endophthalmitis, suggesting that the immune system is usually able to clear a small inoculum of relatively avirulent organisms.</p><p>If a communication with the vitreous is inadvertently created during surgery (eg, break in the posterior lens capsule), the risk of endophthalmitis is much higher (14 times higher in one report) than in patients without a vitreous communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>].</p><p>Additional risk factors were evaluated in a retrospective case-control series of 57 patients with postcataract endophthalmitis and 220 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Implantation of an intraocular lens without a heparinized surface, immunosuppressive therapy, and wound abnormality were risk factors for infection by logistic regression analysis. Risk factors noted in other studies include diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], wound dehiscence or leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], age &ge;85 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and lens implants made of polypropylene (Prolene) instead of polymethyl methacrylate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Advances in surgery, such as phacoemulsification and foldable synthetic intraocular lenses, have allowed incisions so small that they are considered self-sealing. These &quot;sutureless&quot; incisions are now primarily made through the cornea (&quot;clear cornea incision&quot;), which may increase the risk of postoperative endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. There is evidence that clear corneal incisions gape intermittently during the first few days after cataract surgery. This may allow external colonizing flora to enter the eye and account for the increased risk of endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of symptoms occurs within one week of surgery in 75 percent of cases. Patients usually give a 12 to 24 hour history of decreasing vision and eye &quot;ache&quot; (they may deny eye &quot;pain&quot;). Patients feel otherwise well and are afebrile.</p><p>On physical examination, findings are confined to the affected eye. The lids often appear normal, although they may be swollen. The conjunctiva may be injected or edematous (conjunctival chemosis), although these findings can also represent residual postoperative changes. Visual acuity is decreased, and a hypopyon (layering of white blood cells in the anterior chamber) is often present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59911\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59911 \">picture 1</a>). The view of the retina is usually hazy, and, in 80 percent of patients, no retinal vessels can be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Slit lamp examination reveals intraocular white blood cells and protein (called &quot;cells&quot; and &quot;flare,&quot; respectively, by ophthalmologists).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major entity in the differential diagnosis of endophthalmitis is sterile postoperative inflammation. This can result from various causes, including a reaction to retained native lens fragments, extensive iris manipulation, or prolonged and complicated surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The sterile inflammation can mimic early endophthalmitis, although the manifestations are typically greatest on the first postoperative day, whereas bacterial endophthalmitis usually develops on day two or later. However, timing of the onset of symptoms or findings cannot be relied upon to differentiate these entities. Sterile inflammation must be a diagnosis of exclusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory findings are usually normal. Only one-third of patients with endophthalmitis have a white blood cell count greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually normal. An ultrasound of the eye (&quot;B-scan&quot;) usually shows increased echogenicity of the vitreous due to intraocular inflammation. This test can be helpful when the view of the vitreous is obscured by abnormalities in the anterior segment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endophthalmitis is a clinical diagnosis that is confirmed by positive aqueous or vitreous culture. However, a negative culture does not exclude the diagnosis.</p><p>The ophthalmologist can aspirate the aqueous (0.1 mL sample) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vitreous (0.2 to 0.3 mL) with a needle in the office or perform a pars plana vitrectomy in the operating room. A vitrectomy entails the use of a vitrector, an instrument inserted into the vitreous that simultaneously cuts and aspirates some of the 4 mL of gel-like vitreous into a canister. During this process, another catheter irrigates the vitreous with saline. By the end of the case, the vitrectomy canister contains 50 to 100 mL of dilute vitreous washings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59512 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Vitrectomy has the highest yield for a positive culture (90 percent of specimens), whereas only 75 percent of vitreous aspirate specimens are positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. An aqueous aspirate has the lowest yield for a positive culture. In cases with positive vitreous cultures, simultaneous aqueous cultures are positive in only 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Aspirates should be cultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, anaerobic media, meat broth, and Sabouraud agar. One drop should be placed on a slide for Gram stain. Gram stain is positive in approximately 45 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>If a vitrectomy is performed, 3 mL of the vitreous washings should be aspirated from the canister, centrifuged, and the pellet smeared on a slide for Gram stain. The remainder of the canister contents should be vacuum filtered through a 0.45 micron filter; the filter paper should then be cut up and placed on the media listed above.</p><p>It is not yet clear what role molecular diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), will have in the diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis. These methods may amplify bacteria that are conjunctival contaminants and lead to false-positive results. The value of PCR was evaluated in a study that used eubacterial primers to examine aqueous and vitreous samples from endophthalmitis cases and noninfectious controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. PCR was positive in all 20 culture-positive cases, but also in one of the 20 controls. The use of PCR to diagnose endophthalmitis is being evaluated in a large multicenter European study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteriology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since coagulase-negative staphylococci are the predominant organisms colonizing the surface of the eye, and since most cases of postcataract endophthalmitis are due to the patient's own conjunctival flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], it is not surprising that coagulase-negative staphylococci are the major pathogens in postcataract endophthalmitis. The best microbiologic data have been provided by the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS), a multicenter, National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored prospective study of 420 patients with postcataract endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thirty-one percent of patients had negative or equivocal cultures. Organisms isolated in the confirmed culture-positive group included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulase-negative staphylococci &ndash; 70 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> &ndash; 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Streptococci &ndash; 9 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other gram-positive organisms &ndash; 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram-negative organisms &ndash; 6 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute endophthalmitis is a medical emergency. The most important component of treatment of postcataract endophthalmitis is direct injection of antibiotics into the vitreous. Vitrectomy is important in severe cases. The role of adjunctive systemic antibiotics is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17914123\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravitreal antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ophthalmologist first obtains a vitreous sample for culture and then injects antibiotics into the vitreous. Intravitreal antibiotics can be injected either as an office procedure (vitreous aspiration and antibiotic injection, also called &quot;tap and inject&quot;) or in the operating room following vitrectomy (a debridement procedure of the vitreous).</p><p>The empiric intravitreal antibiotics used are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> 1 mg plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> 2.25 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> 0.4 mg. Each agent is diluted in 0.1 mL of sterile water or saline. Ceftazidime is usually preferred over amikacin because of the small risk of macular infarction with injected aminoglycosides. Antibiotic concentrations in the vitreous decline rapidly following injection, so most last only 24 to 48 hours. Thus, one injection of antibiotics may not maintain levels in the vitreous long enough to kill all bacteria. A repeat injection of vancomycin or ceftazidime may be indicated after 48 hours if there is persistent or worsening intraocular inflammation; a second injection of amikacin is avoided given concerns for retinal toxicity. The choice of antibiotic for repeat intravitreal injection is based on the culture result.</p><p>One case of hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis (HORV) following intravitreal injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> for postoperative endophthalmitis has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This case was reported along with 22 other patients (35 eyes) who developed HORV 1 to 21 days after prophylactic intracameral vancomycin for uncomplicated cataract surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The syndrome has been termed vancomycin-associated HORV, appears to be very rare, and is thought to represent a delayed immune reaction to the vancomycin. All cases, except for the one post-endophthalmitis case, have been associated with intracameral vancomycin as prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-vasculitis-associated-with-primary-ocular-disorders#H275848171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal vasculitis associated with primary ocular disorders&quot;, section on 'Hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17914148\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitrectomy is an important component of treatment in eyes with severe infection. Vitrectomy debrides the inflamed vitreous, similar to incision and drainage of an abscess. Vitrectomy leads to better visual outcomes in patients who present with severe vision loss. Whether vitrectomy should also be used in less severe cases is unclear. Similarly, the role of adjunctive oral or intravenous antibiotics in treating exogenous endophthalmitis is unclear.</p><p>The Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study was a multicenter trial that evaluated the role of vitrectomy and the value of adjunctive systemic antibiotics in treating postcataract endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This study changed the practice of treating postcataract endophthalmitis. However, flaws in study design led to controversy regarding the interpretation of some of the results. Four hundred and twenty patients with postcataract endophthalmitis were randomly assigned to four treatment arms (2x2 design): vitrectomy versus vitreous &quot;tap&quot; (aspirate or biopsy) and systemic antibiotics versus none [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The systemic antibiotics used were intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>. All patients received intravitreal antibiotics and all patients assigned to the vitrectomy group received a vitrectomy in the operating room under local anesthesia.</p><p>It is important to note that the vitreous &quot;tap&quot; group in the EVS was not homogeneous. Although a vitreous &quot;tap&quot; is understood by ophthalmologists to mean needle aspiration of the vitreous (an office procedure using topical anesthesia), the &quot;tap&quot; group included patients who received the usual needle aspiration of the vitreous, but also those who received a vitreous biopsy. Two-thirds of the patients had a vitreous &quot;biopsy,&quot; which was really a &quot;mini-vitrectomy&quot; and was performed with a vitrector in the operating room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The EVS authors concluded that there was no difference in visual outcome between the vitrectomy and &quot;tap&quot; groups, except in patients who presented with the worst vision (light perception only). In these patients, vitrectomy was superior and significantly decreased the chance of severe visual loss compared with vitreous &quot;tap&quot; (20 versus 47 percent). In patients who presented with hand motion or better vision, the authors concluded that vitreous &quot;tap&quot; was sufficient. However, objections have been raised to this conclusion, since the comparison was really vitrectomy versus mini-vitrectomy in the majority of patients. The question remains whether patients who present with hand motion or better vision, especially those who present with a rapidly worsening course, might also benefit from vitrectomy (plus intravitreal antibiotics) rather than intravitreal antibiotics alone.</p><p>The EVS demonstrated that vitrectomy sterilizes the vitreous more quickly than intravitreal antibiotics alone. Approximately 10 percent of each group had a second procedure and vitreous culture during the first week due to persistent inflammation. Of these patients, vitreous cultures were persistently positive more often in the &quot;tap&quot; group than the vitrectomy group (71 versus 13 percent), even though both groups had received the same intravitreal antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Therefore, a vitrectomy should be considered for patients with endophthalmitis who received only an initial &quot;tap and inject&quot; on presentation but are failing to improve by 48 hours (or 24 hours in severe cases), since these patients may have persistent infection.</p><p>A subsequent US study attempted to survey ophthalmologists who had treated 1213 endophthalmitis cases in five states between 2003 and 2004 (cases identified by Medicare claims) but received responses for only 719 cases (59 percent) and included only 615 cases (51 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The study concluded that vitrectomy offered no benefit, but its retrospective nature and poor survey response rate confound interpretation of the data. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17914227\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjunctive systemic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic antibiotics alone are not effective in treating bacterial endophthalmitis. Whether systemic antibiotics provide any benefit as adjunctive therapy to intravitreal antibiotics is unknown. Systemic antibiotics that cross the blood-eye barrier may prolong intravitreal antibiotic concentrations achieved following intravitreal antibiotic injection. This may be helpful in killing bacteria in the vitreous. However, there are no studies that have adequately evaluated this. The EVS concluded that adjunctive systemic antibiotics did not improve visual outcome and were not necessary to treat postcataract endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, staphylococci accounted for 80 percent of the study isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but the systemic antibiotics used in the study (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>) have poor activity against staphylococci. In addition, amikacin does not cross the blood-eye barrier, so it is ineffective in treating endophthalmitis. It has been suggested the EVS might have demonstrated a benefit with adjunctive systemic antibiotics had it used a more effective regimen (eg, one that included intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Since the EVS, only retrospective reviews of adjunctive systemic antibiotics have been published. A study from western Australia that reviewed 213 cases of postcataract endophthalmitis from 1980 to 2000 found that patients who received various adjunctive oral antibiotics had better visual outcomes compared with those who did not receive adjunctive antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from this study given the lack of a uniform antibiotic regimen and the retrospective study design. Another study reviewed 72 cases of postcataract endophthalmitis between 2000 and 2009 treated with intravitreal injection of antibiotics (excluding patients treated with initial vitrectomy in addition to intravitreal antibiotics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. All patients received an oral fluoroquinolone for 10 days after intravitreal injection of antibiotics; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> was used between 2000 and 2004 (in 48 patients) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> was used between 2005 and 2009 (in 24 patients). There were no significant differences in patient or surgical characteristics between the two groups. After controlling for potentially confounding factors such as ciprofloxacin resistance, moxifloxacin use was significantly associated with a good visual outcome <span class=\"nowrap\">(20/40</span> or better; adjusted odds ratio 4.07, 95% CI 1.11-14.9).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend the following approach to therapy for patients with postcataract bacterial endophthalmitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cultures of the vitreous should be obtained by needle aspiration or vitrectomy as soon as endophthalmitis is suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics should be injected into the vitreous as soon as endophthalmitis is suspected and vitreous cultures are obtained. Intravitreal antibiotics are the most important component of endophthalmitis therapy. Empiric intravitreal antibiotics are usually given when the etiology is unknown, and these include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> 1 mg plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> 2.25 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a> 0.4 mg.

The outcome of postcataract endophthalmitis depends on the virulence of the pathogen: the worst outcomes are seen in cases due to streptococci of any type and the best outcomes occur in cases due to coagulase-negative staphylococci or cases that are culture negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC PSEUDOPHAKIC ENDOPHTHALMITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pseudophakic-related endophthalmitis is a rare complication of cataract surgery. During cataract surgery, most of the opacified native lens (cataract) is removed, leaving behind some residual native lens and the posterior portion of the lens capsule. An artificial intraocular lens (IOL) is placed in front of this in the posterior chamber, the space between the lens and iris. &quot;Pseudophakic&quot; refers to the intraocular lens. Chronic pseudophakic endophthalmitis is usually caused by <em>Cutibacterium acnes</em>. A few cases have been caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci and diphtheroids. This infection is characterized by low-grade intraocular inflammation that may persist for months. It is often misdiagnosed as noninfectious iritis and typically improves with topical corticosteroid therapy but flares each time corticosteroids are stopped. It may be months before the correct diagnosis is made.</p><p>Symptoms include decreased vision in nearly all patients and eye pain (usually mild) in approximately half of patients. Eye examination with a slit lamp reveals white blood cells in the anterior chamber and, in nearly all patients, a characteristic white plaque in the posterior lens capsule. A hypopyon and white blood cells in the anterior vitreous (anterior vitritis) are also seen in some patients.</p><p>For years, this process was thought to be a reaction to the remaining native lens tissue and was called toxic lens syndrome or phacoanaphylactic endophthalmitis. That the inflammation typically decreased with topical corticosteroid therapy added support to this misdiagnosis. Vitreous culture was negative or grew only <em>C. acnes</em>, initially thought to be a contaminant. Subsequent Gram stain and electron microscopy studies of the removed lens capsule showed small gram-positive rods, consistent with <em>C. acnes</em>, adherent to the capsular remnants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis is often difficult and is based on clinical suspicion supported by cultures of the aqueous or posterior lens capsule. However, cultures of the aqueous are often negative, even in cases where subsequent electron microscopy of the removed lens or lens capsule demonstrates organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Anaerobic cultures should be included if possible. The highest yield for culture is usually by sampling the white plaque in the posterior lens capsule, but this can only be obtained by surgery (removal of the intraocular lens and posterior lens capsule). Aspirate of the aqueous can be performed in an outpatient ophthalmology procedure room using a topical anesthetic.</p><p>Treatment requires at least vitrectomy and intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, although 50 percent of cases recur with this treatment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Removing part of the lens capsule (partial capsulectomy), in addition to vitrectomy and intravitreal vancomycin, reduced the recurrence rate in one study to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, in another study, this treatment was associated with a 44 percent recurrence rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Exchanging the IOL for a new one improved outcomes considerably. The combination of total capsulectomy, IOL exchange or removal, vitrectomy, and intravitreal antibiotics cured all cases in both studies. This was true whether this treatment was used as initial therapy or as treatment of recurrence after other therapy had failed. Systemic antimicrobial therapy is <strong>not</strong> indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8356152\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-INTRAVITREAL INJECTION ENDOPHTHALMITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neovascular, or &quot;wet&quot; macular degeneration, accounts for about 10 percent of cases of macular degeneration. Regular (usually monthly) injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medications into the vitreous are often used to treat wet macular degeneration. Each injection carries a risk of endophthalmitis similar to that of cataract surgery. A study using a Medicare database of 41,000 injections found the risk of postinjection endophthalmitis to be 0.09 percent per injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Since these injections are usually repeated monthly for many months, there is a substantial cumulative risk of postinjection endophthalmitis over time. In many centers, post-anti-VEGF injection endophthalmitis is seen more often than postcataract endophthalmitis. </p><p>Corticosteroids may be injected intravitreally for a variety of reasons, and these injections may carry a higher rate of post-injection endophthalmitis than anti-VEGF injections. A study utilizing a de-identified medical claims database from a large private US insurer found an endophthalmitis rate of 0.02 percent after 387,714 anti-VEGF injections (ie, over fourfold lower than the rate in the Medicare database study above), but an endophthalmitis rate of 0.13 percent after 18,666 corticosteroid injections, suggesting that steroid injections carry a higher risk of post-injection endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, a significant limitation of the study was that culture results were not available, so a comparison of culture-positive endophthalmitis rates was not possible. Cases of post-injection sterile intraocular inflammation mimicking culture-negative endophthalmitis were therefore counted in the study, and this would affect interpretation of the results. Sterile inflammation appears to occur more often after corticosteroid than anti-VEGF injections. Two other studies of intravitreal corticosteroids reported that sterile inflammation occurred after 1.1 to 2.7 percent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], rates much higher than those usually reported after anti-VEGF injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The bacteriology of postinjection endophthalmitis is similar to that of postcataract endophthalmitis, except that the proportion of cases due to viridans streptococci is much higher (30 percent versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Bacteriology'</a> above). This may be due to the fact that these injections occur in an office setting rather than the operating room. Masks are usually not worn, and patient and medical personnel often converse before and during the procedure. Speaking transmits oral flora bacteria into the air, and these organisms can contaminate the ocular surface; wearing a mask or avoiding talking reduces the risk of contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a multicenter study from France involving over 300,000 intravitreal injections, all ophthalmologists wore surgical gowns and hats, sterile gloves, and face masks, and the endophthalmitis rate was 0.021 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].&nbsp;Only 43 percent of cases were culture-positive, and of those, coagulase-negative staphylococci caused 78 percent and streptococci only 4 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">BLEB-RELATED ENDOPHTHALMITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A filtering bleb is used to treat severe glaucoma that has failed medical management. It is a surgically created defect in the sclera, covered only by conjunctiva, which allows excess aqueous humor to leak out of the anterior chamber and be absorbed into the systemic circulation. It is usually placed in the superior portion of the eye and, when the upper lid is raised, it may be seen as a small bump in the sclera. A bleb can also rarely occur as a complication of other types of eye surgery.</p><p>A bleb may become infected (blebitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82722 \">picture 2</a>), and bacteria may enter the eye, resulting in endophthalmitis. The onset of endophthalmitis is usually abrupt and typically occurs months to years following surgery. In a retrospective study of late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis, infection developed suddenly an average of two years postoperatively (range one month to eight years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The incidence of endophthalmitis after bleb surgery in various studies depends on the duration of follow-up and ranges from 0.06 to 13.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/2,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,45,46</a>]. One study used a Kaplan-Meier method to calculate incidence following bleb surgery, based on retrospective data on 239 eyes in 198 patients. The probability of developing endophthalmitis was 1.3 percent per patient-year, with a five-year probability of 7.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Patients with bleb-related endophthalmitis present with sudden onset of eye pain and decreased vision. The eye is often red with purulence over the bleb, although bleb-related endophthalmitis may occur without any signs of blebitis.</p><p>The clinical diagnosis of endophthalmitis is confirmed by vitreous cultures, although vitreous cultures were negative in 45 percent of cases in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Cultures of the infected bleb should also be obtained. Most studies of late-onset endophthalmitis report that 50 percent of culture-positive cases are due to streptococci (viridans streptococci or <em>S. pneumoniae</em>). <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> are other major pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. In contrast, one study found that streptococci caused only about 20 percent of cases, whereas <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis </em>caused approximately 30 percent each [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Cases of late-onset endophthalmitis due to <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em> or gram-negative bacilli other than <em>H. influenzae</em> or <em>M. catarrhalis</em> (eg, <em>Serratia</em>) have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], although these cases are unusual. Early onset bleb-related endophthalmitis, developing within four to six weeks of surgery, is uncommon, and all four culture-positive cases were caused by <em>S. epidermidis</em> in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The outcome of bleb-related endophthalmitis is typically poor, with only 13 percent of 32 patients in one study achieving <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> or better visual acuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Almost one-half of patients in this study were left with minimal vision <span class=\"nowrap\">(5/200</span> or worse), including 10 patients (31 percent) who lost all vision in the infected eye.</p><p>No prospective study has determined optimal therapy. Although the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS) is often cited for treatment approaches to all types of endophthalmitis, this study was of postcataract endophthalmitis only.

Intravitreal antibiotics may be repeated after 48 hours if marked vitreous inflammation persists, although repeat injections of aminoglycosides should be avoided due to concern for toxicity (macular infarction).

Endophthalmitis is much more likely to occur after lacerating injury with a metal object than after injury from glass or blunt trauma. The risk of endophthalmitis is also increased by the presence of retained intraocular foreign bodies, delay in repair of more than 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], and disruption of the lens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>].</p><p><em>Bacillus cereus</em> is one of the major pathogens in most studies and causes a fulminant endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. <em>B. cereus</em> endophthalmitis is characterized by abrupt onset of symptoms 12 to 24 hours after eye injury, and a ring corneal infiltrate. Most eyes lose all vision even with prompt treatment. Other causes of posttraumatic endophthalmitis include coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and gram-negative bacilli such as <em>Klebsiella</em> and <em>Pseudomonas</em> and molds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p>Because of the fulminant nature of posttraumatic endophthalmitis, we advocate the same aggressive treatment as described above for bleb-related endophthalmitis. To prevent endophthalmitis after open globe (penetrating) eye trauma, we recommend two days of systemic prophylactic antibiotics (eg, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> plus either intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>) after the penetrating eye injury.

In the United States, endocarditis is a major cause of endogenous endophthalmitis, causing 40 percent of cases in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, in Taiwan, Singapore, and other East Asian nations, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> is the major cause of endophthalmitis associated with liver abscess, accounting for up to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Half of patients in one series reported no systemic symptoms and over half saw an ophthalmologist first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In another series, fewer than 20 percent of patients had fever on presentation, and 40 percent had an unremarkable general physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Patients who do not have systemic symptoms may initially be misdiagnosed as having noninfectious uveitis. Endophthalmitis should be considered in any patient complaining of decreased vision or eye pain in the setting of possible bacteremia or injection drug use.</p><p>The diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis is established by clinical findings consistent with endophthalmitis (eg, vitritis, hypopyon) in the setting of positive blood cultures or by positive vitreous or aqueous cultures in patients presenting with endophthalmitis but who do not have a history of recent eye trauma or surgery. Blood cultures are positive in 75 percent of those tested, as are vitreous cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>The microbiology of endogenous endophthalmitis varies with the patient population. In North America and Europe, streptococci (<em>S. pneumoniae, S. milleri</em> group, group A, group B) cause 30 to 50 percent of cases, <em>S. aureus</em> causes 25 percent, and gram-negative bacilli cause 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-endophthalmitis/abstract/59,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,61</a>].

The duration of systemic antibiotics should be determined by the need to treat the underlying source of bacteremia (eg, six weeks in many cases of endocarditis). Systemic antibiotics alone will not effectively treat endophthalmitis, however, and all patients with endogenous endophthalmitis require intravitreal antibiotic injection. Vitrectomy plus intravitreal antibiotic injection is indicated in most cases, rather than intravitreal antibiotic injection alone, because of the virulent nature of most of the pathogens involved. Vitrectomy debrides the vitreous and leads to better visual outcome in severe cases of endophthalmitis. If the eye worsens over the next 24 to 48 hours, a second intravitreal antibiotic injection should be given. A third injection may also be given if there is still no improvement after a similar time interval or if cultures from the second vitreous sample were positive. The basis for this approach is discussed above.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial endophthalmitis can be divided into several categories:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute postcataract surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic pseudophakic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Postinjection (eg, after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] medications)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bleb related</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Posttraumatic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endogenous (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365247985\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute postcataract endophthalmitis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute postcataract endophthalmitis is the most common form of endophthalmitis and, in the United States, is almost always due to bacteria. Approximately 95 percent of cases are caused by gram-positive bacteria, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci (70 percent). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Bacteriology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important component of treatment is direct injection of antibiotics into the vitreous. For severe cases, immediate vitrectomy (followed by intravitreal injection of antibiotics) is also essential. Specific recommendations are reviewed above. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2139528\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic pseudophakic endophthalmitis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pseudophakic-related endophthalmitis is a rare complication of cataract surgery; &quot;pseudophakic&quot; refers to the intraocular lens. Chronic pseudophakic endophthalmitis is usually caused by <em>Cutibacterium acnes</em>. Treatment requires at least vitrectomy and intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, although 50 percent of cases recur with this treatment alone. Removal of the residual lens capsule and exchange or removal of the intraocular lens may also be necessary for cure. Systemic antibiotics are not indicated. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Chronic pseudophakic endophthalmitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8356158\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-intravitreal injection endophthalmitis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endophthalmitis may occur after an intravitreal injection of medications to treat &quot;wet&quot; age-related macular degeneration. The incidence is approximately 0.1 percent per injection; since injections are typically given monthly for many months, the cumulative risk is substantial. The bacteriology is similar to postcataract endophthalmitis except that the incidence of viridans streptococci is higher. This may be due to the fact that these injections are performed in the office setting and masks are not usually worn. Having patient and physician (and anyone in the room) either wear masks or completely refrain from talking before and during the procedure may decrease ocular surface contamination with oral flora bacteria, such as viridans streptococci. This in turn may decrease the rate of postinjection endophthalmitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365248000\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleb-related endophthalmitis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A filtering bleb is a surgically created defect in the sclera that is used to treat severe glaucoma that has failed medical management. Bleb-related endophthalmitis can be caused by a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but streptococci, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis </em>are major pathogens. For treatment, we recommend a three-pronged approach that includes vitrectomy, intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>, and a systemic antibiotic that achieves good intravitreal concentrations and treats the most likely pathogens (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Bleb-related endophthalmitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365248008\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttraumatic endophthalmitis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posttraumatic endophthalmitis occurs after penetrating trauma to the globe of the eye in 3 to 10 percent of cases. <em>Bacillus cereus </em>is one of the major pathogens in most studies and causes a fulminant endophthalmitis. Because of the fulminant nature of posttraumatic endophthalmitis, we recommend immediate vitrectomy, intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>, and a systemic antibiotic that achieves good intravitreal concentrations. For initial empiric treatment, the systemic antibiotic chosen should cover <em>B. cereus</em>. To prevent endophthalmitis after eye trauma, we recommend initial systemic prophylactic antibiotics (eg, intravenous vancomycin plus either intravenous ceftazidime or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> for 48 hours). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Posttraumatic endophthalmitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365248016\"><span class=\"h2\">Endogenous endophthalmitis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is rare in the United States and results from bacterial seeding of the eye during bacteremia. In North America and Europe, streptococci (<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>S. milleri </em>group, group A, group B) cause 30 to 50 percent of cases, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> causes 25 percent, and gram-negative bacilli cause 30 percent. In Asia, gram-negative bacilli (especially <em>Klebsiella</em>) cause the majority of cases. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of endogenous endophthalmitis includes intravitreal and systemic antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics alone will not effectively treat endophthalmitis, however, and all patients with endogenous endophthalmitis require intravitreal antibiotic injection. Vitrectomy plus intravitreal antibiotic injection is indicated in most cases, rather than intravitreal antibiotic injection alone, because of the virulent nature of most of the pathogens involved.
