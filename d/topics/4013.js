Hypothyroidism is less prominent clinically and better tolerated when there is a gradual loss of thyroid function (as in most cases of primary hypothyroidism) than when it develops acutely after thyroidectomy or abrupt withdrawal of exogenous thyroid hormone.</p><p>The typical clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may be modified by factors such as coexisting nonthyroidal illness. Furthermore, when hypothyroidism is caused by hypothalamic-pituitary disease, the manifestations of associated endocrine deficiencies such as hypogonadism and adrenal insufficiency may mask the manifestations of hypothyroidism. Finally, when hypothyroidism follows treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism, some manifestations of Graves' disease, such as ophthalmopathy and vitiligo, may persist throughout the patient's life.</p><p>This topic will review the major clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism. The diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and goiter are discussed separately.

Pernicious anemia occurs in 10 percent of patients with hypothyroidism caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Such patients present with a macrocytic anemia with marrow megaloblastosis. However, occasional patients without anemia may display macrocytosis without marrow megaloblastosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In patients with iron deficiency anemia and hypothyroidism, combined therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> and oral iron supplements results in correction of the anemia, which may be refractory to treatment with iron alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of note, levothyroxine and iron supplements should be taken at separate times as oral iron may interfere with absorption of thyroid hormone.

Thyroid hormone regulation of genes coding for specific myocardial enzymes involved in myocardial contractility and relaxation is responsible for the decrease in contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The mechanism underlying the decrease in heart rate is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-effects-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular effects of hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reduced cardiac output probably contributes to decreased exercise capacity and shortness of breath during exercise, two common complaints in patients with hypothyroidism. However, symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure are usually absent in patients who have no other cardiac disease. By contrast, heart failure or angina may worsen when hypothyroidism develops in patients with heart disease. In such patients, T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>) replacement should be administered cautiously, beginning with a low initial dose (eg, 25 mcg) and then increasing in small increments every one or two months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other abnormalities contributing to cardiovascular disease that may occur in hypothyroid patients are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial effusion, which only rarely compromises ventricular function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension, because of an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. In normotensive patients, blood pressure increases are small (eg, maximal blood pressure less than <span class=\"nowrap\">150/100</span> mmHg). The blood pressure of patients with established hypertension, however, may increase further with the development of hypothyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercholesterolemia, which is caused by a decrease in the rate of cholesterol metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Coronary artery revascularization is occasionally necessary in patients with hypothyroidism. Studies have shown that it is safe to operate without T4 replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. T4 raises myocardial and peripheral oxygen consumption, requiring increased cardiac output and cardiac work. These changes can exacerbate established coronary artery disease.

Hypoventilation occurs because of respiratory muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and reduced pulmonary responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although respiratory muscle function is restored by T4 replacement, normalization of gas exchange may not occur, particularly in obese patients.

When euthyroid patients who already have constipation become hypothyroid, their constipation worsens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In occasional patients, marked ileus may be confused with intestinal obstruction. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may also contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Other gastrointestinal problems that can occur in hypothyroidism are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased taste sensation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric atrophy due to the presence of antiparietal cell antibodies.

In a study of 171 premenopausal women with hypothyroidism, 77 percent had normal cycles, 16 percent had oligo- or amenorrhea, and 7 percent had hypermenorrhea-menorrhagia; the respective frequencies in 214 normal women were 92 percent, 7 percent, and 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Among the women with hypothyroidism who had abnormal cycles, the abnormalities persisted despite T4 therapy in almost half.</p><p>These menstrual changes result in decreased fertility. If pregnancy does occur, there is an increased likelihood for early abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Hyperprolactinemia may occur and is occasionally sufficiently severe to cause amenorrhea or galactorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The serum sex hormone-binding globulin concentration may be low in hypothyroidism. This will lower serum total but not free sex hormone concentrations, a change that can be misleading in the evaluation of gonadal function. However, some men with hypothyroidism have low serum free testosterone concentrations but normal serum luteinizing hormone concentrations, suggesting a direct effect of hypothyroidism on the hypothalamus or pituitary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; their serum free testosterone concentrations rise with T4 treatment.</p><p>Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and delayed ejaculation are found in 64 percent of hypothyroid men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

While usually occurring in the setting of other clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism, they may be the presenting feature and can cause significant disability. Most of these complications are partially or fully responsive to thyroid replacement. The more common disorders are discussed in detail separately.

When hypothyroidism is caused by hypothalamic-pituitary disease, the manifestations of associated endocrine deficiencies such as hypogonadism and adrenal insufficiency may mask the manifestations of hypothyroidism.
