The organism was initially discovered in 1911 and for many years was considered to be a harmless yeast. Studies in the 1970s demonstrated that <em>Blastocystis </em>spp are protozoans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. <em>Blastocystis </em>spp are the most common eukaryotic parasites found in human stool specimens, but there is considerable controversy regarding whether they represent a commensal organism or a true pathogen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpathogenic-enteric-protozoa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpathogenic enteric protozoa&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Blastocystis</em> spp have been observed worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The organism resides in the colon and cecum of children and adults. The mode of transmission is not fully understood; fecal-oral transmission has been postulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some authors have suggested that contaminated water may also be a source of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. <em>Blastocystis</em> spp have also been found in animals including pigs, monkeys, rodents, and poultry. There seems to be poor host specificity; transmission occurs from human to human and between humans and animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <em>Blastocystis</em> infections are more common among individuals with occupational exposure to animals, supporting the potential for zoonotic transmission.</p><p>The prevalence of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp varies between countries and between communities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In general, the estimated prevalence of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp is higher in developing countries than developed countries (30 to 50 percent versus 5 to 10 percent, respectively). This may be related to poor hygiene, animal exposure, and consumption of contaminated food or water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one study from Senegal, 100 percent of 93 fecal samples were positive for <em>Blastocystis</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a study from Canada, 8 percent of stool samples submitted to a reference laboratory were positive for <em>Blastocystis</em> spp; when <em>Blastocystis</em> was the sole organism identified, 76 percent of subjects continued to harbor the parasite two months after initial detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p><em>Blastocystis</em> spp are also commonly found in the stool of returned travelers from developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/6,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13-15</a>]. In one study of nearly 2000 stool specimens from travelers and expatriates in Nepal, the prevalence of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp was 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=travelers-diarrhea-microbiology-epidemiology-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Travelers' diarrhea: Microbiology, epidemiology, and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-fever-in-the-returning-traveler\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of fever in the returning traveler&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Blastocystis</em> spp demonstrate marked morphologic variability and measure between 5 and 40 mcm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73525\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73525 \">picture 1</a>). The organism lacks a cell wall but contains mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and smooth and rough endoplasmic reticula typical of protozoa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It reproduces asexually, usually by binary fission. It grows only under anaerobic conditions in culture, and it is highly susceptible to changes in temperature and in environmental tonicity.</p><p>Four different forms have been described: vacuolar, granular, ameboid, and cystic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74028\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74028 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/4,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18,19</a>]. It is unknown whether transmission occurs more frequently during a particular stage or stages. The vacuolar form has a characteristic large central vacuole-like body that compresses the cytoplasm and nuclei to the periphery of the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The vacuolar and cystic forms have been observed most frequently in stool samples. The ameboid stage is most frequently observed in old cultures or after antibiotic administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some have suggested that the ameboid form of the organism is more likely to be associated with clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The granular form is rarely seen in fresh stool.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic variability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extreme genetic diversity has been described among <em>Blastocystis</em> isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>]. There are at least 17 different subtypes, at least 9 of which have been identified in humans. As a result, <em>Blastocystis</em> in humans is referred to as <em>Blastocystis</em> spp rather than <em>Blastocystis hominis</em> (the previously used term for <em>Blastocystis</em> in humans). This genetic and species diversity may account for the disparities of previous data in assessing the morphology, life cycle, and pathogenic role of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp.</p><p>Subtype 3 is the most frequently isolated genotype in epidemiologic surveys and is probably the only species of human origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Subtypes 1, 2, and 4 are the next most commonly isolated subtypes in humans; subtypes ST5 to ST9 are found only rarely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Subtype 1 probably originates from mammals, subtype 2 is mainly from primates and pigs, subtype 4 is from rodents, subtype 5 seems to originate from cattle and pigs, and subtypes 6 and 7 are from birds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some subtypes have a particular geographic distribution, such as avian subtypes ST6 and ST7, which are more frequently found in Asia and the Middle East [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Infection with multiple subtypes has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been significant debate regarding whether <em>Blastocystis</em> spp are intestinal commensals or true pathogens.</p><p>Some several studies have suggested a pathogenic role for <em>Blastocystis</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/6,13,14,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14,25-28</a>], while other studies have shown no correlation between <em>Blastocystis</em> spp and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/12,17,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17,29-31</a>].</p><p>Potential postulated pathogenic mechanisms observed in vitro include apoptosis, degradation of tight junction proteins resulting in increased intestinal permeability, and immunomodulatory effects (induction of proinflammatory cytokines and downregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In one study including 105 healthy adults, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected <em>Blastocystis</em> in 56 percent of individuals and was noted to be present over 6 to 10 years in some cases, suggesting <em>Blastocystis</em> may be a member of the normal human gastrointestinal microbiome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>A number of issues contribute to the controversy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of the reports that have suggested a pathogenic role for <em>Blastocystis</em> spp have been case reports and uncontrolled or retrospective series. There are no properly controlled prospective studies about pathogenicity or the effect of specific therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Criteria are lacking for labeling a specimen as &quot;positive&quot; for <em>Blastocystis</em> spp; diagnostic methods differ, and increasing use of PCR on stool specimens is contributing to a rise in positive test results even among asymptomatic individuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heterogeneity of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp strains, accompanied by variable virulence, might account for differences in pathogenicity. However, evidence remains inconclusive; most studies show no definite correlation between subtype or genotypes and pathogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/34-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-41</a>]. Emerging evidence suggests that subtype 1 and perhaps subtype 3 are most likely to be associated with symptoms, although subtype 3 isolates are not always associated with symptomatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/1,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,42,43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged, irregular shedding of the organism can occur. One study showed that the shedding from day to day ranged from 0 to 17 parasites per 40x microscopic field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. One study described observation of <em>Blastocystis </em>spp two months after first observation in 75 percent of individuals in which it was the sole organism detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Many reports of <em>Blastocystis </em>spp could reflect prior infection with residual chronic carriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/12,14,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some data suggest <em>Blastocystis</em> spp are a stable component of intestinal microbiota and may be present more commonly in healthy individuals than in patients with infectious, functional, or inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Data and tools differentiating asymptomatic colonization from infection are not yet available.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Quantitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some authors have suggested that <em>Blastocystis</em> spp are more likely to be pathogenic if &gt;5 organisms per oil immersion field are detected and that, in lower quantities, the organisms should be disregarded as a potential cause of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. However, others have found no association between parasite concentrations and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/6,12,14,16,29,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,14,16,29,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Copathogenicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Blastocystis</em> spp are often found in association with other potential pathogens; reports have suggested that the majority of patients with <em>Blastocystis</em> spp in their stools have an alternative etiology identified on further examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>It is sometimes inferred that identification of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp in a stool specimen suggests another unidentified pathogen. As an example, one study examined up to six samples from 32 patients with stool specimens positive for <em>Blastocystis</em> spp; another pathogen was identified in 84 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Initiation of treatment for the other pathogen led to resolution of symptoms despite the persistence of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp in follow-up stool specimens. However, another study of patients with diarrhea in Nepal showed that <em>Blastocystis </em>spp did not serve this marker function for other enteric pathogens, which were detected in 68 and 71 percent of patients with and without <em>Blastocystis</em> spp, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>An alternative explanation that has been suggested for the association between <em>Blastocystis</em> spp and other pathogens is that the parasite may be easier to identify in nonformed, watery stools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/16,17,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,48</a>]. It is also possible that an increase in symbiotic bacterial flora during diarrhea might enhance the growth of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There is also some evidence to support the hypothesis that <em>Blastocystis</em> might be linked to the changes in the gut microbiome, leading to intestinal flora imbalance, although the data are inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Carrier state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large number of asymptomatic individuals with stools positive for <em>Blastocystis</em> spp suggests either nonpathogenicity or the existence of a carrier state. Other protozoa such as <em>Giardia</em> are often found in asymptomatic patients but are pathogens when associated with appropriate clinical symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giardiasis-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giardiasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is possible that individuals with immunity due to prior exposure may be more likely to have an asymptomatic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/5,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,52</a>]. Alternatively, pathologic effects might depend upon host factors such as lowered immunity or on disturbances of gastrointestinal function from other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Symptoms have been described in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, including patients with HIV and transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/27,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,53,54</a>]. Although there are case reports of greater prevalence and pathogenicity in immunosuppressed patients, such as those with HIV and transplant recipients, more severe symptoms in immunosuppressed individuals have not been consistently seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17218354\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms that have been associated with identification of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp in stool include watery diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, abdominal cramps, bloating, flatulence, urticaria, and fatigue. Both acute diarrhea and chronic diarrhea have been reported. Fever is usually absent.</p><p>Some studies have suggested a possible link between <em>Blastocystis </em>spp and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although findings have been inconsistent across studies and a causal relationship has not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/51,58-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,58-66</a>]. A meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies investigating whether <em>Blastocystis</em> carriage could be linked to IBS found that patients with IBS had a relative risk of 2.3 for <em>Blastocystis</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. An association between <em>Blastocystis</em> spp and urticaria (acute and chronic) has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>].</p><p>Disseminated infection is rare; two case reports have described identification of the organism in synovial fluid and peritoneal fluid, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. In another report, a child with appendicular peritonitis was found to have <em>Blastocystis </em>organisms in the stool, appendix, peritoneal fluid, and recto-uterine pouch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Blastocystis </em>spp are identified by examination of stool specimen(s) by light microscopy of stained smears or wet mounts. Microscopic identification can be complicated by the variety of forms of the organism that appear in stool specimens, difficulties in finding it in wet mounts, and disruption of the organism with stool concentration techniques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73525\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73525 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74028\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74028 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Commonly used microscopic methods include a formol ethyl acetate concentration technique permanent stained smears (usually trichrome stained). Fecal leukocytes are generally absent.</p><p>Endoscopy usually shows a macroscopically normal-appearing mucosa, and histopathology generally does not demonstrate intestinal inflammation or mucosal invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/55,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,72,73</a>]. Not all studies exclude patients who have other pathogens found, so results can be difficult to interpret.</p><p>A stool culture method is available but is not performed routinely even though it may be more sensitive than microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting serum antibodies to <em>Blastocystis</em> spp has been developed but is also not routinely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Polymerase chain reaction techniques with excellent sensitivity have also been developed, with increasing widespread availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blastocystis-species/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].

Symptomatic patients should have a concentrated stool specimen examined to look for another potential pathogen and should have noninfectious causes of symptoms excluded. If no other pathogen or etiology is identified, it is reasonable to administer therapy for <em>Blastocystis</em> spp with observation for a clinical response, which may be due to eradication of <em>Blastocystis </em>spp or elimination of some other undetected pathogen.

There has been considerable controversy regarding whether <em>Blastocystis</em> spp represent a commensal organism or a true pathogen. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Copathogenicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Blastocystis </em>spp have been observed worldwide; in general, the estimated prevalence of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp is higher in developing than developed countries. The mode of transmission is not fully understood; fecal-oral transmission has been postulated. <em>Blastocystis </em>spp have also been found in animals, and <em>Blastocystis</em> spp are more commonly observed in the stool of individuals with occupational exposure to animals. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Blastocystis</em> spp demonstrate marked morphologic variability. They measure between 5 and 40 mcm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73525\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73525 \">picture 1</a>), and four different forms have been described: vacuolar, granular, ameboid, and cystic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74028\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74028 \">figure 1</a>). Extensive genetic diversity has been described among <em>Blastocystis</em> isolates; nine different subtypes have been identified in humans. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Blastocystis</em> spp are often found in association with other potential pathogens; reports have suggested that the majority of patients with <em>Blastocystis</em> spp in their stools have an alternative etiology identified on further examination. The number of organisms does not necessarily correlate with symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Copathogenicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that have been associated with identification of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp include diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, abdominal cramps, bloating, flatulence, urticaria, and fatigue. Watery diarrhea is usually described. Both acute diarrhea and chronic diarrhea have been reported. Fever is usually absent. (See <a href=\"#H17218354\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis can be made by examination of stool specimen(s) by light microscopy of stained smears or wet mounts. Endoscopy usually shows a macroscopically normal-appearing mucosa, and histopathology generally does not demonstrate intestinal inflammation or mucosal invasion. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, including multiplex PCR on stool, is increasingly being used. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic patients found to have <em>Blastocystis </em>spp on stool examination do not require treatment. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic patients should have a concentrated stool specimen examined to look for other potential pathogens and have noninfectious causes excluded. If no other pathogen or etiology is identified, we suggest administering antimicrobial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>); if clinical response is observed, it may be due to elimination of some other undetected pathogen rather than eradication of <em>Blastocystis</em> spp. We suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (750 mg three times daily for 5 to 10 days) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinidazole</a> (2 g once) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>); alternative agents including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paromomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paromomycin</a> are discussed above.
