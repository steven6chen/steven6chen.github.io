Such reductions in prevalence are generally temporary; mass drug administration interrupts parasite life cycles but does not halt them completely, and the risk for reinfection is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Areas with high prevalence of helminth infection require a number of public health measures beyond preventive treatment, including safe drinking water, basic sanitation, and health education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Issues related to population deworming are discussed here; issues related to the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of individual parasitic infections are discussed separately.

Population deworming may be effective in reducing the prevalence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; the degree of benefit depends on patient characteristics, regional parasite species, and burden of infection.</p><p>The data on efficacy for population deworming is mixed; overall, the evidence demonstrates that children with helminth infections have diminished growth rates compared with uninfected children and that population deworming can help mitigate this issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. The greatest benefit of deworming appears to be among young children who undergo screening prior to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that, overall, mass treatment is not beneficial at a population level, but the WHO continues to recommend this approach since studies suggest that the children who are infected do benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Targeting testing and treatment would be most beneficial, but this approach is too costly in many regions.</p><p>Studies performed in India during the 1990s suggested that deworming of malnourished children one to five years of age was associated with average weight gain of nearly one kilogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and targeting worming of this age group has been advocated based on high prevalence of geohelminth infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Another study among Ugandan children one to seven years of age treated with deworming pills also concluded an association between deworming and weight gain, although the analysis did not reflect that the children were randomized in geographic clusters rather than individually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Subsequently, a meta-analysis including 42 trials noted no association between deworming and child cognition, school attendance, or school performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Evidence for improvement in weight, hemoglobin level, and cognition was greatest among children screened for helminth infection prior to treatment. Thereafter, the largest single trial addressing population deworming was published in 2013; it included 1 million preschool children in north India treated every six months for five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This trial noted no effect on weight gain or mortality; decline in the levels of worm infestation was observed, and compliance with treatment was high. Although the majority of children had a relatively light burden of infection, these studies were corroborated in rural China also in light infection intensity with no improvement on nutrition after deworming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>].</p><p>Repeat analysis of a previous study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] showing favorable outcomes with deworming projects in Kenya demonstrated agreement with reductions in worm infections but did not demonstrate a significant increase in school attendance and noted only a modest improvement in nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The repeat analysis used the original data but documented discrepancies that reduced the statistical significance of deworming benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>The efficacy for population deworming among pregnant women is also mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Some studies have noted an association between deworming of pregnant women (together with iron and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation) and improved neonatal outcome with respect to increased birth weight and reduced infant mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. However, another study including more than 2000 women in Uganda with low-intensity helminth infection noted no overall benefit of anthelminthics during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and there was an increased risk of eczema among newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A 2008 review noted data are insufficient to confirm the benefits of deworming on anemia in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. One study has noted an association between helminth infection in pregnancy and malaria in offspring, suggesting that helminth infection during pregnancy may increase the burden of childhood malaria morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Preliminary studies in Peru showed a relative infant improvement in growth for treated mothers infected with soil-transmitted helminths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>It has been hypothesized that immune responses evoked by helminth infection may influence clinical susceptibility to malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. One randomized trial among 2436 children in Kenya noted that repeated deworming does not alter risk of clinical malaria or malaria parasitemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10826579\"><span class=\"h1\">PARASITE TARGETS FOR DEWORMING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For circumstances in which deworming is felt to be warranted, reasonable target parasite species are listed below; these include intestinal helminths and schistosomiasis.

Infection is transmitted via contact with fresh water containing infectious larvae. In regions with a relatively high burden of disease, mass drug administration alone may not be sufficient to control the prevalence of schistosomiasis; complementary prevention measures (including improving water sanitation and eradicating snail species from fresh water sources) may be needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mass-drug-administration-for-control-of-parasitic-infections/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].
