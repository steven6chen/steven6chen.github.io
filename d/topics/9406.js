Since the approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> for the treatment of CD in 1998, CD has been viewed as an excellent proving ground for anti-inflammatory biologics.</p><p>Despite increasing available therapies, the approved therapies have limited efficacy, and there continues to be concern related to their safety. Thus, a large unmet need exists for the treatment of CD. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mesalamine-mesalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mesalamine</a>, though used widely in CD, has a minor role with little data supportive of a significant benefit, if any, for the treatment of CD. Glucocorticoids, while clinically useful, do not completely control the disease in many patients and have no role for maintenance. While some patients respond to the available anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent, many fail to respond or lose response over time. Thus, newer approaches are being evaluated.</p><p>The dramatic advances in mucosal immunology have revealed a broad set of new targets to resolve the inflammation and symptoms of the disease. The prevailing understanding of CD suggests that the intestinal inflammation is initiated by an aberrant innate immune response, which eventuates in a T-cell driven process, characterized by a T-helper cell 1 type cytokine profile. Many new treatments focus on inhibiting, suppressing, or altering T-cell differentiation. With the identification of a T-cell subset, Th17, which may be responsible for much of the inflammatory process and production of inflammatory cytokines, a new set of therapeutic antibodies are in early phase of testing. The importance of Treg (a T-cell subset that regulates other T cells) has also opened other potential avenues for influencing activated T cells such as targeting SMAD7. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development#H1232221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;, section on 'Th17 cells'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to efforts to manipulate T cells, T-cell products, or inflammatory pathways, other therapeutics are being investigated that take very different theoretical approaches. Examples include the administration or cytokines to stimulate innate immunity, or the use of prebiotics, complex carbohydrates to alter the gut flora. With the approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vedolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vedolizumab</a>, the approach of selective adhesion molecule antagonist is also a focus of considerable effort for new therapies for CD.</p><p>This topic review will discuss experimental treatments for CD. None of the treatments that will be discussed is currently approved for routine clinical application. Furthermore, because many of these agents are in early stages of development, information regarding their efficacy and safety is derived largely from unpublished sources of data.</p><p>Conventional treatments for CD (such as 6-mercaptopurine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>) and an overview of the medical management of CD are discussed in separate topic reviews.

The intestinal mucosa persists in a state of controlled inflammation where proinflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12) are counterbalanced by anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, and IL-13). Because inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a state of dysregulated inflammation, drugs that can augment the anti-inflammatory response have the potential to downregulate inflammation and thereby improve the disease. While the demarcation of Th1 and Th2 types of disease in humans is less clear than in murine models, CD continues to be viewed as a Th1 disease, with interferon and IL-12 as dominant cytokines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-TNF therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Infliximab</a>, a monoclonal antibody with high specificity for and affinity to TNF-alpha, is highly effective in the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active CD and patients with fistulizing CD, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.

Furthermore, it is unclear whether the observed benefit was due to treatment of mycobacteria or to a nonspecific effect of the drugs, some of which have antibacterial effects on enteric flora. Another meta-analysis that included eight trials reached similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-in-the-medical-management-of-crohn-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. A subsequent placebo-controlled trial involving 213 patients found no significant benefit at two years from combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifabutin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifabutin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clofazimine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-in-the-medical-management-of-crohn-disease/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Despite these results, it remains unclear whether there are subsets of patients who might benefit from antituberculosis treatment. Consequently, phase 3 trials are underway for a proprietary combination therapy of clarithromycin, rifabutin, and clofazimine.

Helminths decrease immune responsiveness and reduce inflammation in animal models providing a rationale for trials in humans. Pilot open-label studies have suggested that ingestion of the ova of <em>Trichuris suis</em> improved symptoms in patients with CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-in-the-medical-management-of-crohn-disease/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

Rates of combined (clinical and radiologic) remission at 24 weeks were significantly higher in patients treated with Cx601 as compared with placebo (50 versus 34 percent). The incidence of anal abscess and proctalgia, the most frequent serious treatment-related adverse events, were slightly higher in the placebo group. Additional studies with long-term follow-up are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of Cx601 and its mechanism of action. Of note, the trial excluded patients with more than two internal and three external openings, rectovaginal or abdominal fistulas, and those with previous surgery other than drainage and seton placement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4393319\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukopheresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of devices are being studied that remove a subset of leukocytes by passing a patient's blood through extracorporeal filters.

Many investigational treatments focus on inhibiting, suppressing or altering T-cell differentiation. Other investigational approaches focus on different aspects of the immune system. (See <a href=\"#H4393207\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intestinal mucosa persists in a state of controlled inflammation; proinflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12) are counterbalanced by anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-4, IL-10, IL-11, and IL-13). Inflammatory bowel disease represents a state of dysregulated inflammation. Drugs that can augment the anti-inflammatory response have the potential to downregulate inflammation and thereby improve the disease. (See <a href=\"#H4393214\" class=\"local\">'Proinflammatory cytokine inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesion molecules are involved in leukocyte migration and recruitment to sites of inflammation. Blockage of leukocyte migration has been proposed as a means of down-regulating inflammation.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"#H4393242\" class=\"local\">'Leukocyte adhesion inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other therapeutics under investigation take different theoretical approaches. Examples include the administration of growth hormone to regulate intestinal permeability, the use of helminths to restore T-cell regulation, and the use of prebiotics to alter the gut flora.
