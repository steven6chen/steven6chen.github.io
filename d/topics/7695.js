Genes are basically the body's recipe book. They tell your cells how to make different proteins, and they give your body instructions about how you should look and how your body should work. Unfortunately, genes can sometimes have &quot;mutations,&quot; mistakes in the recipes that change the way your body makes proteins. These mutations can sometimes put you at risk for disease.</p><p>There are genetic tests that look for specific mutations that are linked to lots of different diseases. This article is about mutations that increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer specifically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21044230\"><span class=\"h1\">Which genes affect a person's risk of breast and ovarian cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several genes that affect a person's risk of breast or ovarian cancer. The two genes most often associated with both breast and ovarian cancer risk are called <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>, but experts are learning about other genes that increase the risk of breast cancer (with or without an increase in ovarian cancer risk).</p><p>Genes are passed down in families, so women who have family members with breast or ovarian cancer sometimes have genetic tests to find out if they carry abnormal versions of genes. By having these tests, women can find out whether they need to take special steps to protect themselves from cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21044237\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I have a genetic test for breast and ovarian cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors recommend genetic testing only for women who have a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer.</p><p>Testing might make sense for you if you fit any of these descriptions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have 2 or more close relatives with breast or ovarian cancer, especially if 1 or more of the relatives was diagnosed with cancer before she or he turned 50. (Close family members include your mother, sister, or daughter, and can include men with breast cancer, such as your father, brother, or son.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a close family member with more than one cancer, such as cancer in both breasts, or cancer in the breast and the ovary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have family members from different generations with breast or ovarian cancer. (For example, your grandmother, mother, and sister, all with cancer.) Family history on your father's side is as important as your mother's side.</p><p/><p>Keep in mind, though, that having a strong family history of a disease does not always mean you have abnormal genes. Most women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer do <strong>not</strong> have an abnormal gene.</p><p>If you are thinking about genetic testing because a family member has cancer, ask if she or he has been tested or is willing to be tested first. If the person with cancer does not have the mutation, it is less likely that you do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21044244\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do before I get tested?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before you get tested, talk with a genetic counselor or your doctor. A genetic counselor is a person who can help you understand what the results of the test could mean for you and your family, and what costs might be involved with getting tested. He or she can also help you deal with the feelings you have about being at risk for cancer and can help you understand your results. The results are not always clear cut.</p><p>You can find a list of trained genetic counselors by going online to <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/genetics/directory&amp;token=+4cBCd4hrat9fnIyIQ2cmPgObQOgGVD0T1YhcVPgxtuH7h05L+NLXc0ZpiaDwtyusz4QBBCyxQcIgNk5bd/jGg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16187\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/genetics/directory</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21044251\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I test positive for a genetic mutation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you test positive, try to stay calm. Finding out you carry a mutation can be scary. But there are ways to lower the chances that you will get cancer.</p><p>Ask your doctor and your genetic counselor what your results mean for you. Then ask what you can do to lower your chances of getting cancer. If you are a woman, this table shows the lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer for a woman with a <em>BRCA</em> mutation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57666 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>If you test positive for any genetic mutation that might increase your cancer risk, tell your family about the results. It affects their health as well as yours. Some family members might also want to get tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21044258\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I lower the chances that I will get cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are some things you can do to lower your risk. Doctors have learned a lot about this by studying people with a <em>BRCA</em> mutation, and these options may apply to people with other mutations, too:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting screened for breast and ovarian cancer often. This will not keep you from getting cancer, but it will increase the odds that you will find it early, when it is easier to treat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having your breasts and ovaries removed. To lower your ovarian cancer risk as much as possible, experts suggest that the ovaries be removed as soon as you are done having children, and by age 40 if you have a <em>BRCA1</em> mutation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines that help prevent cancer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combining some or all of these choices</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21044265\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my insurance cover genetic testing?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the US, most health insurance companies cover most of the costs. But your doctor or genetic counselor might need to write a letter to the insurance company to explain why you need testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21044272\"><span class=\"h1\">Can the results of my test keep me from getting health insurance?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. In the US there is a law that prevents companies from using a person's genetic tests to make decisions about insurance coverage or employment.</p><p>The law means that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Employers can't deny you a job or fire you because of the results of genetic tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health insurers can't use genetic test results to deny you coverage or set your insurance rates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Employers and insurers can't force you to have genetic tests</p><p/><p>However, it is important to know that the law does <strong>not</strong> protect someone with a mutation from getting long-term disability or life insurance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21044399\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-reconstruction-after-mastectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast reconstruction after mastectomy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-guide-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breast cancer guide to diagnosis and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medications-for-the-prevention-of-breast-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Medications for the prevention of breast cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
