Both are part of a spectrum of neoplastic diseases known as the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFT), which also includes the more-differentiated peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET; previously called peripheral neuroepithelioma and Askin's tumor of the chest wall) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. PNET can also present either in bone or soft tissue. Because these tumors share similar histological and immunohistochemical characteristics and unique nonrandom chromosomal translocations, they are considered to have a common origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>In addition to their immunohistochemical and cytogenetic similarities, the EFT share important clinical features. These include a peak incidence between the age of 10 and 20 (70 percent of affected patients are under the age of 20), a tendency towards early dissemination to the lungs, bone, and bone marrow, and responsiveness to chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT). Advances in multidisciplinary management over the past 30 years have resulted in a marked improvement in long-term survival. In data derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, five-year survival rates for patients with Ewing sarcoma rose from 36 to 56 percent during the periods 1975 to 1984 and 1985 to 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Here we will discuss the management of the EFT. The epidemiology, pathology, molecular genetics, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of these tumors, surgical principles, indications for limb-sparing surgery, and indications for RT are discussed elsewhere. In addition, central nervous system (supratentorial) PNET tumors and undifferentiated sarcomas lacking classic Ewing sarcoma chromosomal translocations (so-called Ewing-like sarcomas) are biologically distinct from Ewing sarcoma and peripheral PNET. Management of these tumors is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-genetics-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular genetics of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-brain-tumors#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL TREATMENT PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the fact that fewer than 25 percent of patients have overt metastases at the time of diagnosis, EFT is a systemic disease. Because of the high relapse rate (80 to 90 percent) in patients undergoing local therapy alone, it is surmised that the majority of patients have subclinical metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, even in the absence of overt metastases.</p><p>Chemotherapy can successfully eradicate these deposits, and modern treatment plans all include chemotherapy, usually administered prior to and following local treatment. For patients with localized disease, the addition of several months of intensive multiagent chemotherapy to local therapy has had a dramatic impact on survival, and reported 5- and 10-year survival rates are now approximately 70 and 50 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/7-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-16</a>].</p><p>A subset of patients with advanced disease may be cured by multimodality therapy, although the long-term survival rates are clearly lower than for patients with localized disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Approaching a patient who has metastatic EFT with noncurative intent is rarely, if ever, appropriate since it is not possible to predict a priori which patients will be cured. Because of these issues, clinicians experienced in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma must direct the surgery and radiation therapy (RT), and coordination with the <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/pediatric</span> oncologist is essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/11,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of adults with EFT should be guided by the same general principles as are used for younger individuals.</p><p>Multiple studies have consistently demonstrated that older age is an adverse prognostic factor in Ewing sarcoma. Some studies have defined &quot;older&quot; patients as being those over the age of 15 at initial diagnosis, while others have used a cutpoint of 18 years. It is not clear if the worse prognosis in older individuals is due to biological differences or differences in treatment regimens (ie, regimens used in pediatric versus those used in adult medical oncology). Adults who are treated with modern adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for localized EFT may do as well as children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. </p><p>Fewer than 5 percent of cases of EFT arise in adults over the age of 40. There are no clinical trials that address treatment in adults; the vast majority of published studies have specifically excluded older individuals. The available information on treatment and prognosis is limited to seven single-institution series of patients over the age of 15 who were treated for EFT, and a retrospective analysis of data on patients with Ewing sarcoma reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute, which included 383 patients diagnosed at age 40 or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/20,22-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-30</a>]. The largest retrospective series of 102 patients treated between 1977 and 2005 showed an overall survival of 69 percent and an event-free survival of 52 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The more recently treated cohort (treated between 1993 and 2007) had better outcomes (five-year overall and event-free survival of 73 and 60 percent, respectively). This cohort routinely had the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, similar to pediatric treatment protocols, and the authors concluded that their survival rates were similar to those of children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT FOR LOCALIZED DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most modern treatment plans utilize initial (induction or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy followed by local treatment and additional chemotherapy. Reduction of local tumor volume is accomplished in the majority of patients, and this can facilitate resection. This is particularly important with regard to limb-sparing procedures for extremity lesions, but it may also be important for rib, chest wall, and vertebral primaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. Initially, chemotherapy was used in the adjuvant setting to control metastatic disease, but it is now administered prior to local therapy (neoadjuvant therapy) to improve local control as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Since most treatment failures are attributable to systemic metastatic disease, local therapy considerations should never compromise the administration of effective systemic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although patients with extraosseous Ewing sarcoma (EES) have been treated in the past on protocols for rhabdomyosarcoma and have a similar response to multimodality therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], both EES and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) respond to the same chemotherapy regimens as osseous Ewing sarcoma, and patients with these tumors should be treated similarly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. More recent data suggest that patients with EES have slightly superior outcomes compared with patients with osseous Ewing sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Chemotherapy treatment has evolved, largely due to the efforts of several cooperative groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first Intergroup Ewing sarcoma study (IESS-I), the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and actinomycin D (VDCA or VACA) was associated with a significantly better five-year relapse-free survival than vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) alone or VAC plus adjuvant bilateral pulmonary irradiation (60 versus 24 versus 44 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> dose intensity during the early months of therapy further improved response, and in the second Intergroup study (IESS-II), the five-year relapse-free survival rates using intermittent high-dose four-drug therapy improved to 73 percent for non-pelvic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Because of concerns about limiting the dose intensity of doxorubicin in regimens containing actinomycin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], actinomycin D was omitted from most trials thereafter, with no adverse impact on long-term outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adding alternating cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">(I/E)</span> to a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (VDC) backbone <span class=\"nowrap\">(VDC/IE)</span> provides further benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/14,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,42-44</a>]. In a randomized phase III clinical trial (the IESS-III study), the addition of <span class=\"nowrap\">I/E</span> to VDCA was associated with significantly better five-year relapse-free survival compared with VDCA alone (69 versus 54 percent, respectively) in patients with localized (nonmetastatic) disease but not in those with metastatic EFT or PNET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p>As a result of these data, current standard chemotherapy for EFT in the United States includes <span class=\"nowrap\">VDC/IE&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]</span>. Typically, four to six cycles of chemotherapy are given before local therapy in the absence of disease progression followed by local treatment, and then additional cycles of the same treatments are given postoperatively for a total of 14 to 17 cycles. Relief of pain, decrease in tumor size, fall in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, radiologic improvement, and evidence of necrosis in the resected specimen are all evidence of the antitumor effect of the prescribed regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose intense chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sensitivity of EFT to alkylating agents, which have a steep dose-response curve, has prompted the evaluation of dose intense regimens. In a randomized phase III clinical trial conducted by the Children's Oncology Group (COG), dose escalation did not improve outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed localized disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Furthermore, concerns for an increased risk of secondary malignancies in patients receiving dose intense therapy have tempered enthusiasm for this approach. </p><p>Another approach to intensifying therapy is with interval compression, in which chemotherapy cycles are administered every 14 days instead of every 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A phase III trial by COG randomized patients with localized EFT to receive <span class=\"nowrap\">VDC/IE</span> every 21 or 14 days. This trial demonstrated a significant event-free survival (EFS) benefit for interval-compressed <span class=\"nowrap\">VDC/IE</span> given every 14 days, as compared with the same chemotherapy given at 21-day intervals (five-year EFS 73 versus 65 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The toxicity of both regimens was similar. The results of this trial established interval-compressed therapy with alternating cycles of <span class=\"nowrap\">VDC/IE</span> as the preferred North American regimen for front-line treatment of children with localized EFT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110260 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Local treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local control for EFT can be achieved by surgery, radiation, or both. The choice of radiation therapy (RT) or surgery usually represents a tradeoff between functional result and the risk of a secondary radiation-induced malignancy. As such, it should be decided through consideration of patient characteristics, the potential harm and benefit of the treatment options, and patient preference. In most cases of extremity EFT of bone, limb-salvage resections and reconstructions similar to those used for osteosarcomas have been used most frequently if it is anticipated that a wide margin can be achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who lack a function-preserving surgical option because of tumor location (such as the periacetabular region of the pelvis) or extent may be offered RT as an alternative. However, surgery is preferred for potentially resectable lesions and for those arising in dispensable bones (eg, fibula, rib, small lesions of the hands or feet) for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It avoids the risk of secondary radiation-induced sarcomas.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;, section on 'Reconstruction techniques'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Although there are no randomized trials comparing surgery with RT for local control, multiple retrospective series and a systematic review suggest superior local control and, in some cases, EFS for surgery compared with RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/19,48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,48-51</a>]. However, selection bias accounts for at least some of these results (ie, smaller, more favorably situated peripheral tumors or those that respond significantly to chemotherapy are more likely to be resected, while larger, axial lesions are radiated). The difference in local control between RT and surgery has been abrogated in some series when age and primary tumor site were controlled for [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. Radiation dose and proper field planning are also important factors in local control. The role of RT in the local management of Ewing sarcoma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy for Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For primary tumors of the spine, complete surgical resection with negative margins is rarely feasible. Instead, definitive RT is usually the preferred mode of local control in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. For the rare patients who are treated with surgery, the majority will require postoperative RT to achieve local control. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with pelvic primaries have a high complication rate if treated surgically and poorer function if the acetabulum is resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], but some studies suggest superior survival with surgical resection. Local control of pelvic primaries must be individualized. </p><p>The surgical principles that apply to resection of the primary tumor and reconstruction are similar to those in patients with osteosarcoma and are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-sarcomas-preoperative-evaluation-histologic-classification-and-principles-of-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management&quot;</a>). However, there are three main differences between EFT and osteosarcoma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EFT are radiosensitive, while osteosarcoma is much less so.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EFT tend to occur in a younger population, where skeletal immaturity and concern for radiation-induced growth inhibition must be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EFT tend to arise in different areas of the long bones than osteosarcoma (the diaphysis compared with metaphysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76662\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76662 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50795 \">figure 2</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT is usually avoided in patients without residual disease (ie, resected with negative margins) to avoid exposing them to the risk of a radiation-induced malignancy. However, RT is an essential component of therapy for patients undergoing resection if the surgical margins are inadequate, although effective chemotherapy can also reduce the risk of local failure in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>].

However, aggressive multimodality therapy can relieve pain, prolong the progression-free interval, and cure some patients of their disease. In a review of 13 different series in which patients with metastatic EFT were predominantly treated with chemotherapy, five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival rates averaged 25 (range 9 to 55) and 33 (range 14 to 61) percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/7,11,58-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,58-68</a>]. The small numbers of patients in each series and the heterogeneity in location and extent of metastatic disease probably account for these wide variations in outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Disease extent'</a>.)</p><p>In particular, the site of metastatic disease is an important variable. For patients with isolated lung and pleural metastases, EFS rates up to 40 percent are reported with multimodality therapy; for metastases involving bone or bone marrow, EFS rates fall to 10 to 20 percent and, for combined sites, to less than 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Because it can be difficult to predict which patients with metastatic disease will be long-term relapse-free survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], treatment should be administered with curative intent. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General treatment principles'</a> above.)</p><p>Several issues are pertinent to patients with metastatic EFT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the optimal initial chemotherapy regimen?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does dose intensification or interval compression provide benefit in the initial treatment phase?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a role for high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue (termed autologous transplant) as consolidation after initial therapy?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is radiation therapy (RT) to sites of metastatic involvement of any benefit?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How should control of the primary site be approached?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with disseminated disease at diagnosis often respond well to the same type of systemic chemotherapy as is used for localized disease. Fewer randomized trials have been conducted in this population as it accounts for only 25 to 30 percent of patients with Ewing sarcoma. Therefore, there are fewer definitive conclusions that can be garnered from the published literature regarding a standard regimen. Whenever possible, patients with newly diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma should be prioritized for enrollment in open clinical trials evaluating novel approaches.

Most of the available data supporting radiation in this setting are from nonrandomized series, and patient selection factors confound interpretation of the data. Nevertheless, low-dose bilateral whole lung irradiation (12 to 18 Gy in daily 1.5 to 2.0 Gy fractions) may provide added disease control in the lungs without significant pulmonary toxicity and is usually recommended after chemotherapy. This topic is discussed in detail elsewhere.

For selected patients, resection of the primary tumor may be reconsidered if chemotherapy results in significant volume reduction, particularly if areas of small-volume metastatic disease are also amenable to surgical resection. On the other hand, RT, which is more often considered in patients with metastatic disease, will usually provide adequate local control with acceptable morbidity. If substantial amounts of bone marrow will need to be included in the radiation treatment volume, then radiating the primary tumor may occur first, followed by metastatic site radiation, delayed until the end of systemic therapy to avoid interfering with chemotherapy.

For this reason, it is advisable that patients be followed for the potential of late relapse indefinitely.

Other prognostic factors for death in patients with recurrent Ewing sarcoma include recurrence at combined local and distant sites, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms at the primary site or elsewhere should raise concern and be appropriately investigated. Patients with a suspected recurrence should undergo evaluation both of the primary site and for the presence of metastatic disease before a treatment plan is formulated. The majority of patients with a local recurrence have either gross or microscopic metastatic disease.</p><p>The documentation of a local recurrence can be difficult. In patients with metallic endoprostheses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) evaluation can be distorted by metal artifact. The interpretation of irradiated areas on imaging studies can be challenging because of the changes in bone caused by the radiation. Soft tissue masses may represent residual fibrosis rather than recurrent tumor. The evaluation of intraosseous sites is even more difficult since the response to prior therapy and the variability in reossification complicate the interpretation of radiographic studies. Progressive cortical destruction or increasing radiolucent areas suggest local recurrence, as do bone scans that demonstrate increased radiotracer uptake. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be useful to assess the likelihood of recurrence at a site that is suspicious on cross-sectional radiographic imaging. Ultrasound can also be useful to assess for soft tissue masses around an endoprosthesis. The decision to biopsy a site of suspected recurrent local or metastatic disease depends upon patient history and the level of evidence from imaging studies. Open bone biopsies can be associated with local morbidity (ie, wound complications and bone fracture), and needle biopsies may suffice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the prognosis for patients with recurrent disease is poor, some patients can be successfully salvaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dose intense chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local control for EFT can be achieved by surgery, radiation therapy (RT), or both. The choice of RT or surgery usually represents a tradeoff between functional result and the risk of a secondary radiation-induced malignancy. As such, it should be decided through consideration of patient characteristics, potential harm and benefit of the treatment options, and patient preference. For most patients with nonmetastatic disease, surgical resection is preferred if it is anticipated that a complete resection with negative margins can be achieved and a functional reconstruction is possible. Patients who lack a function-preserving surgical option because of tumor location or extent may be offered RT as an alternative to resection. Surgery is also preferred for lesions arising in dispensable bones (eg, fibula, rib, small lesions of the hands or feet). A combination of radiation and surgery is reserved for cases in which negative margins cannot be achieved while still preserving function. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Local treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy for Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant RT'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Following local treatment, chemotherapy is usually continued (the same alternating <span class=\"nowrap\">VDC/IE</span> regimen), typically for several months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110260 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with clinically detectable metastatic disease at initial presentation also require multimodality therapy. Patients with advanced disease typically should be approached with potentially curative treatment. Up to 40 percent of patients with limited pulmonary metastatic disease who undergo intensive chemotherapy and pulmonary resection with or without RT may be long-term survivors. The prognosis for other subsets of patients with advanced disease is less favorable. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment for metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with pulmonary metastases, we suggest a multimodality approach that includes chemotherapy and supplemental low-dose whole lung irradiation, with surgical resection considered for lung metastases that do not resolve with chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-for-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy for Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary metastases'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is no conclusive evidence that high-dose therapy with hematopoietic stem cell infusion is beneficial for patients with metastatic EFT, and we do not recommend this approach outside of the context of a clinical trial. Most patients with advanced or recurrent disease need new approaches to improve outcomes, and participation in clinical trials should be encouraged. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of relapses occur within two years of initial diagnosis, but late relapse is not uncommon. For all EFT of bone or soft tissue, there are no prospective data that address the appropriate schedule or selection of tests for surveillance after initial treatment for localized disease. Consensus-based guidelines from the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=Uq9WYRsg9p/PSM9vt3rBGtHa7uSejixwk2tJVlS5LMeu0awaX/Er3fekhDozpt3zew+Yt0LRtO7qp5BoCEEM5YoFu3K3VNa+mIo9yk7LJGM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7740\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> and from the <a href=\"http://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/&amp;token=S16MTPPY6cpS0A68kxrRsQOkLnEIm8+QaMhQyNKCcl+JTIC9BC9aNpypysLPfb9F&amp;TOPIC_ID=7740\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Children's Oncology Group (COG)</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68393\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68393 \">table 2</a>) recommend physical examination, a complete blood count, chest imaging, and local imaging of the primary site every three months for two years, every six months for years 3 to 5, and annually thereafter. Long-term follow-up (lifelong) is needed following therapy because disease relapse, treatment-related complications, and second malignancies all occur beyond five years after treatment is initiated. (See <a href=\"#H24921961\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the prognosis for patients with recurrent disease is poor, some patients can be successfully salvaged. The sites of recurrence, prior treatment, and relapse-free interval affect the remaining treatment choices. Most patients with recurrent disease will receive systemic therapy prior to attempts at additional local control measures. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The survival of patients with Ewing sarcoma has improved steadily since the 1970; however, long-term survivors have considerable burden of the late effects of their therapy. These include second malignancy, pathologic fractures, other radiation-associated complications (wound complications, pulmonary fibrosis, neuropathy, limb leg discrepancy, femoral head necrosis), and chemotherapy-related complications (second malignancy, reduced fertility, renal insufficiency, and cardiomyopathy).
