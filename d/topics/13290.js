It happens when tissues that support the organs in the lower belly relax. These tissues are sometimes called the &quot;pelvic floor.&quot; When they relax too much, the organs drop down and press against or bulge into the vagina.</p><p>If the bladder bulges into the vagina, doctors call this problem &quot;cystocele.&quot; If the rectum bulges into the vagina, they call it &quot;rectocele.&quot; Uterine prolapse means the uterus has bulged into the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53393 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Some things can increase a woman's risk of having pelvic organ prolapse. They include pregnancy, obesity, and older age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24722773\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women with this problem have no symptoms. But some women with pelvic organ prolapse have symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fullness or pressure in the pelvis or vagina </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An aching feeling in the pelvis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bulge in the vagina or coming out of the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaking urine when they laugh, cough, or sneeze</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needing to urinate all of a sudden</p><p/><p>When they use the toilet, some women need to press on the bulge in the vagina with a finger to get out all their urine or to finish a bowel movement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24722788\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for pelvic organ prolapse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will be able to tell if you have it by doing a pelvic exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24722803\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some women feel better if they do pelvic muscle exercises. These exercises strengthen the muscles that control the flow of urine and bowel movements. They are also known as &quot;Kegel&quot; exercises. Your nurse or doctor can teach you how to do them or refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24722818\"><span class=\"h1\">How is pelvic organ prolapse treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have no symptoms or who are not bothered by their symptoms do not need treatment. For women with symptoms that bother them, doctors suggest different treatments, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic floor muscle exercises &ndash; Patients work with a physical therapist for 8 to 12 weeks to strengthen the pelvic muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A vaginal pessary &ndash; This device fits inside a woman's vagina to support the bladder and push it back into place. Pessaries come in different shapes and sizes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; A surgeon can move dropped organs back where they belong and strengthen the tissues that keep them in place. Women should have this type of surgery only if they are done having children.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24722833\"><span class=\"h1\">Can pelvic organ prolapse be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of pelvic organ prolapse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight if you are overweight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get treated for constipation if you are constipated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid activities that require you to lift heavy things</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24722848\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-muscle-kegel-exercises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pelvic muscle (Kegel) exercises (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-floor-muscle-exercises-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
