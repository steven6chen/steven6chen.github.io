Some (eg, combined hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma) represent collision of two different tumors or may result from malignant transformation of hepatic progenitor cells with differentiation along two different cell lineages. Secondary liver tumors (ie, metastases from a non-liver primary site) are the most frequent malignant liver tumor, outnumbering primary malignant liver tumors by a large margin (30 to 1 in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]), particularly in patients without underlying liver disease.</p><p>Several premalignant lesions that arise in the liver have been extensively studied in order to better understand both hepatocarcinogenesis and cholangiocarcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Premalignant hepatocellular lesions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysplastic foci, characterized by cytological small cell change </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysplastic nodules, encompassing low-grade dysplastic nodules and high-grade dysplastic nodules</p><p/><p>Premalignant biliary lesions are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary intraepithelial neoplasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraductal papillary neoplasm of bile duct</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucinous cystic neoplasm (also known as cystadenoma and its malignant counterpart cystadenocarcinoma)</p><p/><p>This topic review will cover the pathologic appearance of malignant liver tumors, including invasive and premalignant lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97463\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97463 \">table 1</a>).

HCC commonly develops in patients with chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cirrhosis itself is the greatest single risk factor for the development of HCC. The incidence of HCC varies geographically according to the different levels of exposure to specific risk factors, such as chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection, exposure to aflatoxin (in developing countries), and alcohol abuse and smoking (in developed countries). Other factors that increase the risk of HCC are fatty liver disease, hereditary hemochromatosis, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Up to 30 percent of HCCs in non-cirrhotic liver appear to arise from hepatic adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-adenoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic adenoma&quot;, section on 'Risk of malignant transformation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048093856\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) classification categorizes HCC, fibrolamellar carcinoma, and hepatoblastoma (epithelial variant) under the category of hepatocellular epithelial tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma and mixed epithelial-mesenchymal hepatoblastoma are classified under malignancies of mixed origin category. (See <a href=\"#H1048093975\" class=\"local\">'Hepatoblastoma'</a> below and <a href=\"#H73346145\" class=\"local\">'Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to general WHO tumor type classification, other pathologic descriptions of HCC are often used as well; they are based upon degree of differentiation (Edmonson-Steiner grading: well differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated, and undifferentiated), morphological pattern (trabecular, solid, pseudoglandular, scirrhous, inflammatory, steatohepatitic), or cell type (clear cell, small cell, spindle cell, giant cell).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048093863\"><span class=\"h2\">Gross pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HCC may form a large solitary circumscribed nodule with or without adjacent smaller satellite nodules. In the presence of cirrhosis, HCC may be multinodular within one lobe, which consists of multiple nodules scattered throughout the liver, or may infiltrate the liver diffusely without forming circumscribed nodules (ie, nodular, diffuse, expansive, infiltrative, multifocal, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], but none has proven useful for prognostication or guiding therapy.</p><p>HCCs are usually soft, tan to yellow, often bile-stained, and show areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. Large vessel vascular invasion can be identified on gross examination, and the frequency increases with tumor size. The portal vein and hepatic veins as well as the vena cava may be involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97326\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97326 \">picture 1</a>). Invasion of major bile ducts is an uncommon finding, but when present, it can cause biliary obstruction.</p><p>Small tumors (&lt;5 cm if solitary, or up to three nodules, each smaller than 3 cm) have a better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], while the presence of satellite nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and major vessel invasion are adverse features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. For patients undergoing tumor resection, the main predictor of poor outcome is incomplete resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The degree of differentiation reflects the resemblance of tumor cells to normal hepatocytes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well-differentiated HCCs are often small (&lt;2 cm) and composed of cells with mild atypia, arranged in a thin trabecular pattern with rare pseudoglandular structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97328\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97328 \">picture 2</a>). The tumor cells are typically polygonal with granular and eosinophilic cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97328\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97328 \">picture 2</a>). The tumor cells may secrete bile, an exclusive feature of HCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97329\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97329 \">picture 3</a>), and contain fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97330\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97330 \">picture 4</a>), glycogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97331\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97331 \">picture 5</a>), Mallory-Denk hyalins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97332\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97332 \">picture 6</a>), hyalin globules, or fibrinogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97334\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97334 \">picture 7</a>) mimicking or in exaggeration of normal hepatocyte function. A large amount of cytoplasmic fat <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glycogen causes a clear cell appearance, which may be difficult to distinguish from metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most often the tumor grows in a trabecular pattern, with cords of cells separated by vascular sinusoids that are lined by endothelial cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97335\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97335 \">picture 8</a>), mimicking the cell plates and sinusoids of normal liver. The microtrabecular pattern consists of a thin cord of cells, and the macrotrabecular pattern is formed by a thick cord of cells. Expansion of the trabeculae may compress the sinusoids and form a solid or compact pattern of growth. Occasional dilated bile canaliculi, often containing bile and producing a pseudoglandular pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97336\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97336 \">picture 9</a>), may be seen in the centers of trabeculae. Connective tissue stroma is typically sparse, and reticulin fibers are significantly reduced or absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderately-differentiated HCCs are usually larger tumors (&gt;3 cm), and they are composed of polygonal tumor cells in thick trabecular pattern with frequent pseudoglandular pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97337\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97337 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorly-differentiated HCCs are composed of pleomorphic tumor cells in a solid or compact growth pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97338\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97338 \">picture 11</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2409297\"><span class=\"h4\">Variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several less common histologic subtypes of HCC, including scirrhous, spindle cell, giant cell, inflammatory lymphoepithelioma-like, undifferentiated, and small cell variants:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The scirrhous variant is morphologically composed of tumor cells in a background of dense fibrous stroma rather than the sinusoids that are typical for HCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97344\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97344 \">picture 12</a>). This HCC subtype should be differentiated from cholangiocarcinoma, which typically shows abundant dense desmoplastic fibrous stroma. (See <a href=\"#H1048093912\" class=\"local\">'Cholangiocarcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spindle cell variant mimics metastatic sarcoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97345\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97345 \">picture 13</a>), but extensive sampling may yield polygonal hepatoid cells that are diagnostic of HCC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The giant cell variant is considered to be a poorly-differentiated form of HCC and is composed of large multinucleated giant cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97346\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97346 \">picture 14</a>) It should be differentiated from metastatic giant cell carcinoma from other organs.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-lung-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of lung malignancies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrapulmonary-small-cell-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrapulmonary small cell cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Extensive sampling of these uncommon HCC variants may demonstrate minor areas of typical HCC. In addition, these special HCC subtypes may lose HCC-specific antigenicity usually seen in conventional HCC and may not stain with the usual immunohistochemical reagents. (See <a href=\"#H73345470\" class=\"local\">'Immunohistochemistry'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048093877\"><span class=\"h3\">Dysplastic focus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysplastic focus is an expansile focus of hepatocytes with cytologic changes indicative of dysplasia and measuring less than 1 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Dysplasia as a premalignant change in hepatocarcinogenesis takes the form of small cell change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], which is cytologically recognized as hepatocytes with decreased cytoplasmic volume, cytoplasmic basophilia, mild nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromasia, and increased nuclear cytoplasmic ratio (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97355\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97355 \">picture 15</a>). According to the original definition, dysplastic focus measured &lt;1 mm in diameter, but this arbitrary size criterion was related to the fact that the microscopic lesions were usually contained within a single cirrhotic nodule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A dysplastic focus is often free of iron deposition (ie, iron-free focus) in a liver with hemochromatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Unlike small cell change, large cell change (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97357\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97357 \">picture 16</a>) is not directly related to hepatocarcinogenesis (in other words it is not a premalignant lesion), but it has been linked to cellular senescence and it is more prevalent in cirrhotic livers with HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Large cell transformation is an important independent risk factor for the subsequent development of HCC, and its presence may be used to identify a subgroup of patients at high risk for HCC requiring more intensive screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048093884\"><span class=\"h3\">Dysplastic nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysplastic nodules are considered preneoplastic lesions, supported by the accumulation of evidence that points to the existence of a sequence of events in dysplastic nodules that precedes the emergence of HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. The evolution of dysplastic nodules into early carcinoma includes induction of an arterial blood supply and stromal invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. They are usually (but not exclusively) detected in cirrhotic livers. On cut surface, dysplastic nodules bulge and differ from the surrounding cirrhotic liver.</p><p>Dysplastic nodules are classified into low-grade dysplastic nodules (LGDNs) and high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDNs) based upon cytologic and architectural atypia as seen on microscopic examination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In LGDN, the hepatocytes rarely show a clonal population, and there is minimal nuclear atypia and only a slight increase in the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. Large cell change is often present, but mitotic figures are absent. Without obvious clonal population, the distinction between LGDN and a large regenerative nodule is difficult and does not carry any practical consequences as long as the nodules lack the features of HGDN.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HGDN shows cytologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> architectural atypia but is insufficient for the diagnosis of HCC. Small cell change and architectural atypia, such as thick plates (up to three cells thick) and occasional pseudoglandular structures, are common in HGDN. In needle biopsies, the differential diagnosis between HGDN and well-differentiated HCC may be difficult or impossible. The vascular supply of dysplastic nodules is altered, particularly in HGDN, where unpaired arteries can occasionally be found with increase of sinusoidal capillarization beyond the vicinity of portal tracts as demonstrated by immunostaining for CD31 or CD34. (See <a href=\"#H73345470\" class=\"local\">'Immunohistochemistry'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A combination of glypican-3 (GPC3), heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70), and glutamine synthetase immunostaining may aid the distinction between HGDNs and HCCs. (See <a href=\"#H73345470\" class=\"local\">'Immunohistochemistry'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048093891\"><span class=\"h3\">Small and early hepatocellular carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small HCCs up to 2 cm in diameter are classified into distinctly nodular type and vaguely nodular type. Distinctly nodular HCCs (also known as progressed HCCs) are mostly moderately differentiated, lack portal tracts, and show evidence of microvascular invasion. Vaguely nodular HCCs (also known as early HCCs or small HCC with indistinct margins) retain the basic architecture of the background cirrhotic liver, and the neoplastic cells grow in and replace the nonneoplastic liver cords. The small neoplastic cells (reminiscent of small cell change) are arranged in irregular, thin trabeculae with pseudoglandular structures or fatty changes. They grow around preexisting portal tracts <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invade the portal tracts (stromal invasion). A fibrous capsule is lacking, and the tumor contains &quot;entrapped&quot; portal tracts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97360\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97360 \">picture 17</a>).</p><p>Most vaguely nodular HCCs are well-differentiated HCCs. Most of these nodules are clinically hypovascular because of the insufficient development of unpaired tumor arteries and incomplete sinusoidal capillarization. Distinctly nodular HCC or progressed HCC is biologically more advanced and usually of higher grade, and there are typical HCC features and well-developed unpaired tumor arteries, which facilitate their detection by contrast enhanced imaging methods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Small nodules with a &quot;nodule-in-nodule&quot; appearance are either HGDN with a subnodule of HCC, or a well-differentiated HCC with a subnodule of moderately-differentiated HCC. The former is commonly completely hypovascular, but the latter is usually detected as a hypovascular nodule containing a hypervascular focus on contrast images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Stromal invasion, as an important criterion of a carcinoma, is easier to identify in distinctly nodular HCC but is obscured in the vaguely nodular type. The absence of cytokeratin (CK)7-positive duct staining is a feature of areas of stromal invasion in small HCC and can be helpful in distinguishing small HCCs from minimally invasive HCCs of the vaguely nodular type, and overtly invasive HCCs of the distinctly nodular type.

In well-differentiated and moderately-differentiated tumors, the trabeculae are lined directly by CD34 or CD31-positive endothelial cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97339\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97339 \">picture 18</a>). The presence of bile canaliculi may be highlighted by polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (pCEA) or CD10 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97340\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97340 \">picture 19</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The canalicular pattern of staining for pCEA or CD10 indicates hepatocellular differentiation and is diagnostic of HCC. The tumor cells may also contain alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or alpha-1-antitrypsin or fibrinogen that can be demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining. However, high serum levels of the tumor marker AFP do not correlate with positive AFP immunostaining. AFP immunostaining is positive in less than 40 percent of HCCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

This is in contrast to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which rarely occurs in children younger than five years old. The incidence of hepatoblastoma in boys is twice that in girls. Syndromes with an increased incidence of hepatoblastoma include Beckwith Wiedmann syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 21, Acardia syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome (a type of craniofacial microsomia), type 1a glycogen storage disease (von Gierke disease), and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

The epithelial component always predominates and consists of two types of cells: &quot;embryonal&quot;-type cells, which are small, basophilic, darkly stained with uniform, hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm, arranged in sheets, ribbons, rosettes, acini, or tubules; and &quot;fetal&quot;-type cells, resembling hepatocytes with central round to oval nuclei and abundant granular or clear cytoplasm depending on the amount of glycogen or fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97394\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97394 \">picture 31</a>). The cells are larger, eosinophilic, and lighter stained than the embryonal-type cells and arranged in trabeculae or plates. They are separated by sinusoids and may form bile canaliculi. The variation of darker and lighter-stained cells is characteristic of hepatoblastoma. Extramedullary hematopoiesis is often present in the sinusoids. When the biopsy specimen is small and contains only fetal-type cells, the distinction from well-differentiated HCC may be difficult.</p><p>The presence of a mesenchymal component, most commonly osteoid tissue and rarely cartilage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97394\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97394 \">picture 31</a>), rhabdomyoblasts, or neural elements, rules out HCC. AFP is almost always demonstrable in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell component by immunohistochemical staining.</p><p>Approximately 2 percent of hepatoblastomas are composed of small cell undifferentiated cells (small cell undifferentiated hepatoblastoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>], resembling a neuroblastoma or other small blue cell tumor.

The entire liver is frequently involved. The tumor is composed of pleomorphic spindle or epithelioid cells, often with bizarre or multinucleated forms; mitoses are evident (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97398\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97398 \">picture 33</a>). Better-differentiated areas may show large cavernous spaces that are lined by atypical endothelial cells.

(See <a href=\"#H1048093835\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common primary liver malignant tumor is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC may form a large solitary circumscribed nodule with or without adjacent smaller satellite nodules. In the presence of cirrhosis, HCC may be multinodular within one lobe, or consist of multiple nodules scattered throughout the liver, or may infiltrate the liver diffusely without forming circumscribed nodules. The cells of HCC resemble hepatocytes in function, cytologic features, and growth patterns. The degree of differentiation reflects the resemblance of tumor cells to normal hepatocytes. Immunohistochemically, most well to moderately well-differentiated HCCs are positive for hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar1), arginase-1, cytoplasmic thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), glutamine synthetase, glypican-3 (GPC3), and cytokeratins (CK) 8 and 18. (See <a href=\"#H1048093849\" class=\"local\">'Hepatocellular carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrolamellar carcinoma differs clinically, histologically, and molecularly from conventional HCC. It affects younger individuals, is often not associated with elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and has a better prognosis than conventional HCC. The immunohistochemical profile is similar to that of HCC, such as positive staining for HepPar1, and GPC3. However, immunostains for CK7, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and CD68 are positive in fibrolamellar carcinoma only. (See <a href=\"#H1048093898\" class=\"local\">'Fibrolamellar carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholangiocarcinomas (CCs) are primary cancers arising from bile duct epithelium that may occur anywhere along the biliary tree from small bile ducts and bile ductules in the liver (intrahepatic CC) to large hilar and extrahepatic bile ducts (extrahepatic CC). Immunohistochemistry can be very helpful for the differential diagnosis, which includes primary HCC and metastatic adenocarcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97387 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1048093912\" class=\"local\">'Cholangiocarcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CCC) is a subtype of intrahepatic CC that is thought to originate from a hepatocyte progenitor cell that can give rise to tumors with a whole range of phenotypes that have varying hepatocellular and cholangiocellular differentiation characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H1048093933\" class=\"local\">'Cholangiolocellular carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Combined or mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma is a tumor with intimately mixed elements of both HCC and CC; it must be distinguished from separate HCC and CC arising in the same liver lobe (which may be separated or intermixed [&quot;collision&quot; tumors]). They are classified, staged, and treated as intrahepatic CCs. (See <a href=\"#H73346145\" class=\"local\">'Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are three precursors to CC: intraductal papillary neoplasm of bile duct (IPMN), the rare intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm of bile duct (ITPN), and the much more common biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN), which are divided into low- and high-grade types. When an invasive carcinoma is present, it should be separately designated and staged as CC. (See <a href=\"#H150450565\" class=\"local\">'Precursor (intraductal) lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver (MCN) encompasses cystic tumors previously referred to biliary cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma. However, the term cystadenocarcinoma has been used to designate high-grade MCN, and MCN with an invasive component. The terms &quot;MCN with high-grade dysplasia&quot; and &quot;MCN with an associated invasive carcinoma&quot; are preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-malignant-liver-tumors/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1048093954\" class=\"local\">'Mucinous cystic neoplasms (biliary cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy in early childhood.

In both cases, immunostaining is positive for vascular markers such as the ERG transcription factor, CD31, CD34, and Factor VIII antigen.
