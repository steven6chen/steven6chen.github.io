Renal tubular dysgenesis can be caused by renal hypoperfusion in the first trimester due to twin-twin syndrome, prenatal exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), mutations in genes associated with the renin-angiotensin system (see <a href=\"#H2363623125\" class=\"local\">'Renal tubular dysgenesis'</a> below), or be caused by severe liver disease due to congenital hemochromatosis.
