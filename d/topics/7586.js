Cases of GHB dependence and withdrawal have been reported in the United States (US), Canada, Europe, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/1-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-15</a>]. </p><p>The Texas Department of State Health Services has reported a steady increase in the number of patients admitted for treatment of GHB dependence, from 2 in 1998 to a peak of 113 in 2008 and 91 in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. According to this report, GHB dependent users were slightly older than other users of club drugs (average age 29 to 32 years), often had a history of injection drug use, and frequently had primary dependency problems with amphetamines or methamphetamines. Users also reported using GHB&rsquo;s sedative effects to counteract the stimulant effects of methamphetamine, and vice versa. Combined data from Texas and the California Poison Control System (CPCS) suggest that GHB dependence is more common among men and occurs in a wide age range (17 to 60 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. According to CPCS data, common reasons for starting to use GHB are bodybuilding and treatment of insomnia. </p><p>Although total exposures declined over the course of the CPCS study, the proportion of patients with severe outcomes from GHB withdrawal increased from 10 of 130 cases in 1999 to 2001 to 10 of 37 cases in 2002 to 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Of 167 total cases, 80 (48 percent) were admitted to a hospital for treatment of withdrawal. The median hospital stay was three days, with 27 of 80 (34 percent) admitted for five or more days. A review of 38 cases of withdrawal from GHB reported a mean duration of nine days (range 3 to 15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Questionnaire data collected from 52 patients with a history of GHB dependency lasting from 1.5 to 6 years found that 26 (50 percent) had a combined 57 ED presentations for acute overdose or associated trauma, 49 (94 percent) reported experiencing multiple episodes of overdose involving loss of consciousness, and eighteen (35 percent) had sustained injuries from falls, including 18 head and facial injuries requiring medical treatment, 7 extremity fractures, and 14 extremity sprains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/1,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19</a>].

Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4 butanediol (BD) are analogs or precursors of GHB which, when ingested, are rapidly metabolized to GHB, with the same clinical effects. All three compounds, GHB, GBL and BD, are used as dietary &ldquo;supplements&rdquo; for purported health benefits, including bodybuilding and treatment of insomnia, anxiety, and alcohol dependence. Tolerance, psychological and physical dependence, and withdrawal have been reported among individuals using GHB, GBL, and BD for both recreational purposes and purported health benefits. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/1-8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8,20</a>]. </p><p>GHB is also used as a therapeutic agent in the United States and Europe. In the US, GHB is available as Xyrem (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium oxybate</a>), which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive daytime sleepiness. In Europe, GHB is available as Xyrem, as Alcover, which has been studied for treatment of alcohol and drug dependence, and as Somsanit, which has been approved as an anaesthetic. Craving, abuse, dependence, and withdrawal have been reported in therapeutic trials in which <span class=\"nowrap\">GHB/Alcover</span> was administered under close supervision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>], as well as among patients treated with Xyrem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY, CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY, AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pharmacology, cellular toxicology, and kinetics of gamma hydroxybutyrate are discussed separately; aspects of these that are directly related to dependence and withdrawal are briefly discussed immediately below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) intoxication&quot;, section on 'Pharmacology and cellular toxicology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-intoxication#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) intoxication&quot;, section on 'Kinetics'</a>.)</p><p>In brief, GHB exerts agonist effects on GHB-specific receptors and on GABA-B receptors resulting in neuroinhibition. Similar to frequent ethanol and benzodiazepine use, chronic GHB use is believed to lead to tolerance associated with down-regulation of inhibitory GABA and GHB receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/2,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26-28</a>]. Subsequent decreased GHB consumption results in decreased GABA- and GHB-mediated neuroinhibition, resulting in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission (glutamate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> and dopamine systems) and the onset of a withdrawal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>].</p><p>Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4 butanediol (BD) are GHB analogs that are rapidly metabolized to GHB after ingestion, with the same toxic and recreational effects. Addicts use the three compounds interchangeably. GHB tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal develop subsequent to chronic BD and GBL use and manifest with the same symptomatology as GHB dependence and withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/5,6,20,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,20,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2404171514\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR GHB DEPENDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of GHB for bodybuilding or to treat insomnia may increase the risk for dependence.

In one such study, 44 percent of individuals who began using GHB for purported health benefits subsequently used the drug to treat insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Cases of GHB abuse and dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], severe withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] have been reported among patients prescribed Xyrem for insomnia.

Many individuals who are dependent on GHB take doses throughout the day and night to prevent the onset of withdrawal and therefore are at increased risk of GHB toxicity, sudden loss of consciousness, and falls and other trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/10,19,20,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19,20,41</a>].

Initial symptoms of GHB withdrawal most often include anxiety, tremor, diaphoresis, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, and insomnia. Within 24 hours symptoms may progress to severe withdrawal, with refractory agitation, hallucinations, delusions, and delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The symptom course is often unpredictable: apparent initial improvement may be followed by dramatic deterioration or the recurrence of symptoms, including hallucinations, delirium, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/2,5,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,44,45</a>]. </p><p>Profound insomnia is common among patients with GHB withdrawal and has been reported to play a key role in ongoing use and relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/10,18,31,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18,31,46</a>]. Severe insomnia, occurring prior to presentation and persisting for several days after hospitalization, despite the administration of antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>) and benzodiazepines, can occur and may exacerbate psychosis and delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/4,6,32,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,32,45</a>].</p><p>Significant variability has been noted in the presentation and treatment response of patients withdrawing from GHB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/18,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,47</a>].

Without obtaining a clear history of GHB abuse and discontinuation, the clinician must evaluate the patient for other, more common causes of agitated delirium, for which the differential diagnosis is broad. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of note, the autonomic disturbances associated with GHB withdrawal are typically mild when compared with withdrawal or acute intoxication syndromes associated with other sedative-hypnotic agents, alcohol, or sympathomimetic agents. Conversely, agitation and delirium are often prolonged with GHB withdrawal.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of GHB withdrawal includes other sedative-hypnotic or alcohol withdrawal syndromes, acute GHB intoxication, acute intoxication with sympathomimetics (including drugs of abuse, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a>, ma huang, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a>), anticholinergic syndrome, hypoglycemia, seizure disorder, serotonin syndrome, thyroid storm, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, head injury, CNS infection (encephalitis, meningitis), and any of the medical etiologies of altered mental status, as well as functional psychosis.

The results of such testing often require 7 to 10 days, precluding their use in acute management. Furthermore, the rapid disappearance of GHB in the blood (four to six hours) means that blood concentrations are likely to be negative, unless the patient presents with acute intoxication and progresses directly into withdrawal. While confirmation of GHB in urine may confirm GHB ingestion and support the diagnosis, it is unlikely to be positive if the urine specimen is collected longer than 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Laboratory confirmation is unnecessary for the diagnosis of GHB withdrawal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">General evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GHB withdrawal is a clinical diagnosis; no laboratory tests are necessary.

Intravenous diazepam can be titrated, but is more likely to result in respiratory depression than oral diazepam. Barbiturates such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentobarbital</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> can also be used. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Propofol</a> has been used successfully used in refractory cases.

Patients with extreme agitation may require more frequent and larger doses. Very large doses may be given, provided respiratory status is closely monitored and tracheal intubation can be performed immediately if necessary. Massive doses of diazepam may be needed: in one case, dosing equivalents of 2655 mg of diazepam were administered over 90 hours for control of severe GHB withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Although loading doses (oral or IV) may not decrease the likelihood of withdrawal delirium, they reduce the severity of delirium and control agitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Once adequately loaded, patients generally need smaller additional amounts to control symptoms.

There is no advantage to these agents over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>. </p><p>Although symptom-triggered therapy protocols, similar to those used in the treatment of alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, have not been validated for GHB withdrawal, we believe this is a reasonable approach and concur with the use of rapidly escalated doses until control of agitation or delirium is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/60,61,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61,63-65</a>].

In such cases, an alternative sedative should be used. As an example, if 200 mg of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> over 30 minutes fails to achieve control of agitation, it is reasonable to add a barbiturate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Barbiturates'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Propofol'</a> below.)</p><p>Once acute withdrawal symptoms are controlled, benzodiazepine treatment may be continued over several weeks in severe cases, with the dose gradually tapered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A general guideline for tapering is to reduce the daily dose approximately 10 percent per week. If symptoms recur, the previous week's dose is given.

There are several reports of patients treated for GHB withdrawal with low doses of benzodiazepines and then discharged who have required readmission within 24 to 48 hours after representing in florid withdrawal and requiring chemical and physical restraints for prolonged periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. </p><p>Nevertheless, on occasion, supervised out-patient detoxification may be necessary. Economic realities render some patients unable to pay for inpatient therapy, while others are unwilling to undergo in-patient detoxification. Supervised out-patient treatment is safer than unsupervised self-treatment, which has proven fatal in some instances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Literature describing out-patient GHB detoxification is limited. In one case series, out-patient treatment of GBL-dependent patients was offered only to those patients who: (1) had a responsible adult at home capable of providing help; (2) were able to attend clinic for daily monitoring and dosage adjustment during the first two to three days of treatment; and (3) were not dependent on other drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Management focused on preventing delirium by initiating treatment immediately at the first sign of withdrawal. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diazepam</a> was titrated to symptom control; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> was also given. Monitoring was performed with daily clinic appointments for three days followed by weekly appointments for four weeks. Although 15 of 17 patients completed out-patient treatment, study authors found outpatient management of withdrawal to be difficult due to erratic patient response to phone calls and missed clinic appointments. They also noted that many patients experienced post-withdrawal anxiety, panic attacks, depression, insomnia, and social withdrawal, with symptoms lasting weeks to months. </p><p>One other outpatient protocol has been reported for the treatment of patients with mild GHB withdrawal (ie, no psychotic symptoms and vital signs that normalize rapidly with treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gamma-hydroxybutyrate-ghb-withdrawal-and-dependence/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

GHB use can lead to severe dependence. Cessation can lead to withdrawal, which may be lethal. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of GHB withdrawal symptoms occurs rapidly, typically within one to six hours of cessation or decrease. Initial symptoms include anxiety, tremor, diaphoresis, tachycardia, vomiting, and insomnia. Insomnia can be profound. Within 24 hours symptoms may progress to severe withdrawal, with refractory agitation, hallucinations, delusions, and delirium. Delirium may develop rapidly and persist as long as 14 days. Symptom course often progresses unpredictably. Autonomic instability, if present, is usually mild to moderate. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features of withdrawal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe and refractory agitation increases the risk of hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of GHB withdrawal is made clinically based on the presence of typical symptoms in an individual with a known history of prolonged or habitual GHB abuse. Without such a history, the clinician must evaluate the patient for other, more common causes of agitated delirium, for which the differential diagnosis is broad. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No laboratory tests are necessary to diagnosis GHB withdrawal. Tests are obtained on the basis of the history and examination to investigate alternative diagnoses or complications. In patients experiencing GHB withdrawal, we generally obtain the following studies: basic electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, creatine kinase, and a complete blood count. Coingestants are common among GHB abusers so it is reasonable to perform the basic studies done on all potentially poisoned patients, including fingerstick glucose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and salicylate levels, electrocardiogram, and a pregnancy test in women of childbearing age. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of GHB withdrawal is primarily supportive, with administration of sedatives to control agitation, delirium, hyperthermia, and seizures, and careful monitoring for respiratory depression and potential complications. We suggest clinicians use long-acting benzodiazepines for the control of symptoms due to GHB withdrawal (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 10 mg IV every 5 to 10 minutes and titrate to restfulness. Patients with extreme agitation may require more frequent and larger doses. Very large doses may be administered, provided respiratory status is closely monitored and tracheal intubation can be performed immediately if necessary. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Benzodiazepines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> and other neuroleptic agents <strong>not</strong> be used in the treatment of GHB withdrawal (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Such agents are ineffective for symptom control and increase the risk for major adverse reactions. (See <a href=\"#H1749616768\" class=\"local\">'Antipsychotic medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course of withdrawal is unpredictable, even with optimal treatment. For this reason, patients with mild withdrawal are treated in an in-patient setting, while patients with severe withdrawal require admission to an intensive care unit. Management of withdrawal and dependency is reviewed in detail in the text.
