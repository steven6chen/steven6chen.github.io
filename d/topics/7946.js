Most of the time, H. pylori infection does not lead to any problems or cause any symptoms. But in some people, H. pylori infection leads to problems that can cause symptoms. These problems can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open sores, which are called &quot;ulcers,&quot; on the lining of a person's stomach or duodenum &ndash; The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach cancer</p><p/><p>These conditions can sometimes cause pain or discomfort in the upper belly, nausea, or vomiting.</p><p>Doctors do not know why H. pylori infection leads to problems in some people and not others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480480758\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of H. pylori infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with H. pylori infection have no symptoms. But people who have ulcers can have symptoms that are caused by the ulcers. Common symptoms of ulcers can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or discomfort in the upper belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling full after eating a small amount of food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeling hungry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark or black-colored bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling more tired than usual</p><p/><p>Not all ulcers are caused by H. pylori infection. For example, people can get ulcers from taking certain pain-relieving medicines. But if you have the symptoms listed above, let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480480765\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for H. pylori infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can do different tests to diagnose H. pylori infection. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breath tests &ndash; These tests measure substances in a person's breath after he or she has been given a special liquid to drink.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests that check a sample of a bowel movement for H. pylori infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor takes a small piece of tissue from the lining of the stomach. Then he or she looks at the tissue under a microscope. A doctor can do a biopsy during a procedure called an endoscopy. An endoscopy is a procedure that lets a doctor look at the inside lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480480772\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I be tested for H. pylori infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should be tested for H. pylori infection if you have symptoms and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an ulcer in the stomach or duodenum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have had ulcers in the past</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have had stomach cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you need to be on anti-inflammatory medication or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> for a long time</p><p/><p>Doctors also sometimes test people with symptoms who have never had an ulcer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480480779\"><span class=\"h1\">How is H. pylori infection treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>H. pylori infection is treated with medicines. Most people need to take 3 or more medicines for 2 weeks. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to reduce the amount of acid that the stomach makes &ndash; This can help cure the infection and help ulcers heal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different types of antibiotics</p><p/><p>People who are diagnosed with H. pylori infection should get treated, because treatment can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help ulcers heal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep ulcers from coming back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the chance that an ulcer will get worse or lead to cancer</p><p/><p>It is important to follow all your doctors' instructions about taking your medicines. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any side effects or problems with your medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480480786\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, most people have follow-up tests to check that the H. pylori infection has gone away. Follow-up tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breath tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests that check a sample of a bowel movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper endoscopy with biopsy</p><p/><p>Most of the time, H. pylori infection is cured with treatment. But sometimes, H. pylori infection is not cured with treatment. People who still have H. pylori infection after being treated might need to take more medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1480480793\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peptic ulcers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Helicobacter pylori infection and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Peptic ulcer disease (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
