Because of this, the PT is changed to a standard number, called the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Your INR value tells your doctor if your blood is clotting too much or too little. This is true even if you get the test done in different lab (if you are traveling, for example).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556655733\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do I need a PT/INR test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You need regular <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> tests if you take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> (sample brand names: Coumadin, Jantoven). This medicine helps prevent dangerous blood clots. Doctors prescribe it to people who might get blood clots or who have had a blood clot in the past.</p><p>If you are <strong>not</strong> taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a>, your doctor might do a <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> test if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are going to have surgery and the doctor is concerned about unexpected bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your have symptoms of a bleeding problem, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your urine or bowel movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have very heavy menstrual periods</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a condition that could affect how your blood clots, such as liver disease</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556655748\"><span class=\"h1\">If I take warfarin, how often do I need a PT/INR test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will get a <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> test before you begin taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a>, and then again after about 3 doses of warfarin. </p><p>Your doctor will then adjust your <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> dose to get your <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> to the right level. For most people that means an INR between 2 and 3. You might need <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> tests every few days for a while, to make sure you're taking the right dose of warfarin. Once your test result stays the same for at least 1 to 2 weeks, you can probably get tests just once a month. You might have a <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> test more often if something changes, such as if you get sick, start a new medicine that affects your <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR,</span> or have any bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556655765\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do a PT/INR test at home?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you will be taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> for a long time, you might be able to use a home monitor to test your <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> at home. Talk to your doctor about whether you could use a home monitor.</p><p>PT home testing machines are about the size of a small book. You use the machine to test a drop of blood from your finger. The readout on the machine shows your <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> value.</p><p>You then report the number to your doctor, who will tell you if you should change your <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> dose. This is called &quot;self-monitoring.&quot; Some people might be able to learn how to adjust their own warfarin dose. This is called &quot;self-management.&quot; Self-management is only for people who have been trained by a doctor or nurse and have shown that they know how to change their dose. Do <strong>not</strong> try self-management without the OK of your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H556655782\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-warfarin-coumadin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Warfarin (Coumadin) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-coumadin-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Warfarin (Coumadin) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
