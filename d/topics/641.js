In patients with secondary MN, cessation of the offending drug or effective treatment of the underlying disease is usually associated with improvement in the nephrotic syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Untreated patients with idiopathic MN have an appreciable incidence of partial or complete remission over a period of three to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Thus, while almost all patients with idiopathic MN should receive nonimmunosuppressive therapies (eg, angiotensin inhibition, other antihypertensive drugs to achieve the goal blood pressure, salt restriction and diuretics for control of edema and statins for hyperlipidemia), immunosuppressive therapy should be limited to patients who are at high risk for progression of disease.</p><p>The identification of patients who are at risk for progression of disease and the indications for the treatment of MN are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The primary regimens used to treat idiopathic MN include a cytotoxic drug (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or, less often, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>) plus glucocorticoids or calcineurin inhibitors with or without glucocorticoids. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> is also occasionally used. The therapy of idiopathic MN with these agents is discussed elsewhere.

There was no difference between the percentages of patients who achieved complete or partial remission; (64 percent of the group that received MMF and 67 percent of the group that received chlorambucil). At the end of follow-up (only nine months after end of therapy), there were no differences in patients with treatment resistance (four versus three) or relapse (two versus one).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second randomized open-label trial in 21 patients, MMF was as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Eleven patients received MMF (2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> for six months) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> for 12 weeks); 10 patients received cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids in an alternating monthly schedule for six months. Remission rate was similar (64 percent versus 80 percent), and there were no relapses during a follow-up of 17 months.</p><p/><p>Similar findings were noted in a nonrandomized study of 64 patients with membranous nephropathy (MN) and renal insufficiency (median baseline serum creatinine concentration was 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [159 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thirty-two patients were treated with MMF (1 g twice daily for 12 months) and compared with 32 historic control patients who had received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> at a dose of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. Both groups also received glucocorticoids. The partial remission rate at 12 months was not significantly different (66 versus 72 percent). However, during follow-up (median of 23 months), treatment resistance was significantly higher in the MMF group (five versus zero patients), as was the incidence of relapse (12 versus 4 patients).</p><p>In contrast to the above evidence of benefit, another randomized trial of 36 patients found that MMF monotherapy was ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. All patients had normal kidney function and were of moderate risk for progression with protein excretion ranging from 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. All received the same conservative therapy including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), statins, low-salt and low-protein diet, and diuretics, and 19 patients received MMF (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> in addition to conservative therapy. At 12 months, there was no difference between the two groups in the frequency of complete or partial remission of proteinuria (37 versus 41 percent with conservative therapy alone) or in renal function. Adverse side effects were observed in 4 patients (20 percent) who were treated with MMF.</p><p>It is not clear why this study did not replicate the benefit noted in the two prior randomized and the large observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. One difference is that patients were treated with MMF alone rather than in combination with glucocorticoids as in the previous studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistant disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A second issue is the efficacy of MMF in patients who have failed previous treatments with glucocorticoids, cytotoxic agents, and calcineurin inhibitors. Data are limited to anecdotes and small observational studies on this issue. No randomized controlled trials have been performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixteen patients with idiopathic MN, of whom 15, 5, and 7 had failed glucocorticoids, cytotoxic agents, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, respectively, were treated with MMF for approximately eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. MMF was given at 500 to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> with seven patients receiving the full dose. Concomitant glucocorticoid therapy was given to only five patients. At six months, proteinuria decreased to one-half of initial levels in six patients, with partial remissions in another two. Most patients had evidence of renal dysfunction, and with treatment there were no significant changes in the serum creatinine concentration. MMF was well-tolerated without the induction of serious side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective report, MMF therapy was evaluated in 17 patients with MN who had one or more of the following: dependence upon glucocorticoids with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or cytotoxic agents; resistance or intolerance to glucocorticoids or cyclosporine; suboptimal response to cyclosporine; or increasing renal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Treatment duration and follow-up were four months to two years. Ten of the 17 patients received MMF 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> 11 of whom also received glucocorticoids. Proteinuria significantly decreased, with the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio falling from 7.8 to 2.3 among the 15 nephrotic patients. In addition, 14 of 15 patients with either glucocorticoid or cyclosporine dependence were able to successfully withdraw from either agent. There were no significant changes in the median serum creatinine concentration, and renal function improved in three out of six patients with renal insufficiency at baseline. MMF dependency was observed in four patients, and therapy had to be discontinued in three because of erosive gastritis, pneumonia, and squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p/><p>In summary, insufficient data support the use of MMF with glucocorticoids as initial therapy in idiopathic MN. However, MMF may be a therapeutic option for some patients with MN who have either relapsed after treatment with cytotoxic agents or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, or are unable to tolerate these regimens. There is also limited support for the use of MMF in patients who are resistant to cytotoxic agents or cyclosporine.</p><p>Drawbacks to the use of MMF include the associated side effects, variable efficacy, and, in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], a high rate of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The effects of MMF in patients with MN need to be studied further in larger prospective trials that have sufficient follow-up to examine renal survival outcomes. These trials should evaluate whether or not treatment with MMF can be improved by targeting serum MMF levels, which might lead to the use of higher MMF doses than the currently advised dose (ie, 1 g twice daily combined with glucocorticoids for 6 to 12 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66597592\"><span class=\"h2\">Synthetic ACTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several uncontrolled reports of synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) improving proteinuria in patients with membranous nephropathy (MN). Although the mechanism of action remains unknown, there are experimental animal data supporting a direct effect on the melanocortin receptors of the podocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. This was further examined in a randomized trial of 32 nephrotic patients with treatment-na&iuml;ve, recent-onset MN in whom one year of therapy with ACTH was associated with complete or partial remission in 87 percent of patients (compared with 93 percent in the standard [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>] therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Other studies have evaluated the efficacy of synthetic ACTH in patients with MN who have a higher risk of disease progression. In one study of nine patients with MN, including three patients with relapsing disease and six patients with an insufficient response to previous immunosuppressive therapy, one year of synthetic ACTH (1 mg intramuscularly weekly) produced a complete or partial remission in four patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In three of these four patients, remission occurred after 36 months of follow-up. Another study included 20 patients with MN who were considered to have a high risk for disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-agents-in-the-treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Synthetic ACTH (1 g twice weekly) was given for nine months. Compared with a historical control group who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, 11 of the 20 patients developed a complete or partial remission (55 versus 95 percent with cyclophosphamide). Remission persisted in only seven patients (35 percent). The authors concluded that ACTH was less effective than cyclophosphamide, and its superiority over placebo remained undetermined. </p><p>Synthetic ACTH as a depot preparation is typically used at a starting dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week,</span> increasing to 1 mg twice weekly, with tapering after six to nine months. Mild cushingoid effects may be observed, about equivalent to those seen with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose of 15 to 20 mg per day.

Treatment was given in doses of 40 or 80 units, injected subcutaneously twice weekly for a period of 12 to 24 weeks. At one year, two patients were in complete remission, and 10 patients were in partial remission (response rate of 60 percent). The per-protocol analysis suggested that the response rate was slightly higher in patients who received the higher dose (69 percent).

MN is most often idiopathic but may also be caused by a variety of drugs and underlying diseases. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary regimens used to treat idiopathic MN include cytotoxic drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>, or calcineurin inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>) both given with glucocorticoids. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> is also occasionally used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF), given with glucocorticoids, may be as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> in inducing remission of proteinuria but is associated with a high rate of relapse. MMF may be a therapeutic option for some patients with MN who have either relapsed after treatment with cytotoxic agents or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, or are unable to tolerate these regimens, although there are no data on the long-term effect of MMF on renal survival. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Resistant disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has been associated with complete or partial remission in some patients with idiopathic MN. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies have suggested a limited benefit of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> among patients with MN.
