Such patients are at increased risk for serious morbidity and mortality, including cognitive disorders, depression, physical trauma, and sudden death in epilepsy. The goals of treatment for individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy are to render the patient seizure free, avoid treatment-related adverse effects, and allow the individual to become a participating and productive member of society.</p><p>Most individuals who will respond favorably to antiseizure drugs are successfully managed within the first two years of treatment. Patients who do not respond favorably to two antiseizure drugs used appropriately are likely to have drug-resistant epilepsy and should be investigated for surgery and other alternative forms of treatment.</p><p>Surgical therapy is an important and underutilized treatment in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Surgical procedures for epilepsy range from focal resection of the epileptogenic cortex (antero-mesial temporal lobe and other focal cortical resections) to interventions that remove or isolate the cortex of a grossly diseased hemisphere (functional hemispherectomy, anterior corpus callosotomy, multiple subpial transections). The latter procedures are most often performed in children and are not discussed further here. In general, only complete resection of the epileptogenic brain region offers the chance of long-term seizure freedom.</p><p>This topic will discuss the surgical treatment of drug-resistant focal epilepsy in adults utilizing focal cortical resection. Epilepsy surgery in children and other aspects of epilepsy management and treatment in adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of drug-resistant epilepsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-refractory-seizures-and-prognosis#H1539302193\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in children: Refractory seizures and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Epilepsy surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7378479\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL CANDIDATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal cortical resection is a consideration in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy if the seizures emanate from a region that can be removed with minimal risk of disabling neurologic or cognitive dysfunction.</p><p>The localization of seizure onset, underlying surgical pathology, and seizure type(s) are important determinants of surgical candidacy and outcomes. The most favorable candidates are those with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-identified lesions that represent both the pathologic process underlying the epileptogenic brain tissue and the location of seizure onset. Such MRI findings, together with concordant electroencephalography (EEG) data, are pivotal in selecting operative candidates and determining the strategy for the surgical procedure. (See <a href=\"#H7379259\" class=\"local\">'Surgical evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>In adults, there are three major types of seizure disorders that may be remedied with focal cortical resective surgery:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with localization of the epileptogenic zone in the amygdala and hippocampus are the most common candidates for effective surgical therapy. As discussed below, substantial observational data and a single completed randomized trial support the superiority of surgical therapy compared with continued antiseizure medication for patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. (See <a href=\"#H7379271\" class=\"local\">'Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lesional epilepsy due to focal structural pathology, such as a low-grade glial tumor, cavernous malformation, or malformation of cortical development (MCD) with medically refractory seizures, may also be good surgical candidates. There are important differences in the likelihood of surgical success depending on the specific pathologic finding, however. For example, operative outcomes are distinctly less favorable in individuals with focal cortical dysplasia and other MCDs. (See <a href=\"#H7379284\" class=\"local\">'Lesional epilepsy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and a normal brain MRI are more challenging, but some of these patients are nonetheless good surgical candidates. Localization of the epileptic brain tissue in these patients often requires long-term intracranial EEG monitoring in addition to functional and metabolic brain imaging. (See <a href=\"#H7379278\" class=\"local\">'Neocortical epilepsy with normal brain MRI'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Patients who are usually not surgical candidates for focal cortical resection include individuals with bilateral or multifocal seizure onset, those with significant medical comorbidities that preclude the surgery, and patients with generalized-onset epilepsy. Patients in whom the site of seizure onset and initial seizure propagation is intimately associated with functional cortex may also not be appropriate candidates for resective surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7379259\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the surgical evaluation are to identify the epileptogenic zone, determine the extent to which it can be resected, and avoid operative morbidity, especially injury to eloquent cortex. Standard components of the surgical evaluation are discussed below.</p><p>In general, decisions about the potential effectiveness of focal cortical resection rely most heavily on the concordance of clinical seizure semiology, ictal and interictal scalp electroencephalography (EEG) findings, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) typically play a confirmative role in cases of questionable structural lesions or in patients with multiple lesions or a normal MRI. Neuropsychologic testing and functional localization techniques are used to help localize the epileptogenic zone and determine the safety of the proposed procedure, for example by estimating cognitive reserve in the contralateral hemisphere.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957579\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive evaluation is essential in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Patients should be referred to neurologists who have subspecialty expertise in epilepsy and are based at a comprehensive epilepsy center that has the necessary multidisciplinary resources and personnel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of drug-resistant epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The history and neurologic examination are critical to confirm the diagnosis and characterize seizure semiology and clinical localization. Particular emphasis should be placed on the presence of multiple or differing seizure semiologies, which may raise concern for multiple epileptogenic zones.</p><p>Comorbid psychiatric disease (eg, anxiety or depression) is common in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and has been associated with worse postsurgical seizure outcomes. While the presence of a psychiatric disorder does not preclude surgery, presurgical psychiatric evaluation and psychosocial assessment are advised in order to mitigate potential complications postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7379333\" class=\"local\">'Psychologic sequelae'</a> below.)</p><p>At most epilepsy centers, each patient's diagnostic evaluation is discussed at a surgical epilepsy consensus conference prior to epilepsy surgery in order to discuss the surgical treatment plan, as well as to review potential alternative treatment options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957567\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropsychologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuropsychologic studies are performed to evaluate the presence of verbal or nonverbal learning and memory deficits. The rationale for these studies as part of a presurgical epilepsy evaluation is threefold:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To lateralize or localize functional alterations that may assist in identifying the region of seizure onset</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To counsel the patient regarding the likely memory outcome following cortical resective surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To provide a baseline determination of cognitive performance before surgery that can be compared with a postoperative examination</p><p/><p>Neuropsychologic studies may be of highest diagnostic yield in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy.</p><p>Intellectual disability has traditionally been a relative contraindication to temporal lobectomy because it implies bilateral and potentially diffuse rather than focal brain pathology. In some studies, low intelligence quotient (IQ) has been associated with lower postoperative seizure remission rates and increased risk of postoperative cognitive sequelae. However, intellectual disability may not be an independent predictor of surgical outcome, and some patients may still benefit from epilepsy surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957471\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine and video-EEG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine EEG recording with standard activating procedure and long-term scalp-recorded video-EEG monitoring are essential to confirm and localize the site of seizure onset in individuals with focal epilepsy. Additional scalp-recorded EEG electrodes, including anterior or inferior temporal electrodes, are often placed to increase the diagnostic yield of the neurophysiologic studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electroencephalography (EEG) in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Special electrode placement'</a>.)</p><p>Interictal and ictal EEG patterns are utilized for surgical localization. Using computer-assisted video-EEG in an inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit, habitual seizures are recorded to determine the correlation between ictal semiology and EEG findings. The peri-ictal neurologic examination provides an additional functional assessment that can assist in lateralizing and localizing the epileptogenic zone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957477\"><span class=\"h2\">High-resolution brain MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients undergoing surgical evaluation should have a high-resolution brain MRI with sequences optimized for visualization of the hippocampus and gray-white matter junction. The MRI should include coronal or oblique-coronal T1- and T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Postcontrast T1-weighted images are not useful in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis but should be included in the evaluation of suspected tumors or vascular anomalies. High field strength (3-Tesla) MRI is preferred for maximal sensitivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-in-the-evaluation-of-seizures-and-epilepsy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging in the evaluation of seizures and epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Epilepsy protocol for MRI'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis (also called mesial temporal sclerosis), the most common imaging alteration is hippocampal atrophy with a signal intensity change that reflects gliosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77659\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77659 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69972\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69972 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. FLAIR sequences increase the sensitivity of MRI to indicate a signal change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Loss of internal structure of the hippocampus may also be seen. An MRI finding of mesial temporal lobe sclerosis is predictive of better seizure and neurocognitive outcomes following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>High-resolution structural MRI also has a high diagnostic yield in patients with tumors or vascular malformations. The latter are often best visualized on gradient-echo sequences, which are sensitive for blood products. Typical imaging features of tumors and vascular malformations are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular malformations of the central nervous system&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brain-arteriovenous-malformations#H8887936\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brain arteriovenous malformations&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with focal cortical dysplasia, MRI findings may be subtle and include mild cortical thickening, a prominent deep sulcus, a cortical signal intensity change, blurring of the gray-white junction, or aberrant cortical architecture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65171\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65171 \">image 3</a>). Thin-section 3D volumetric MRI and reformatted 1.5 mm 3D spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) sequences are particularly useful, since it is difficult to resolve volume-averaged normal cortical infolding from true abnormalities if the spatial resolution of the images is coarser than 1.5 mm. Higher field strength (eg, 3-Tesla) also aids in detecting cortical dysplasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2958132\"><span class=\"h3\">Advanced MRI techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitative MRI techniques have limited diagnostic value over and above visual inspection but may provide useful prognostic information. MRI-based volumetric studies of the hippocampal formation can objectively determine the degree of hippocampal volume loss in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis using a standardized protocol; results are compared with age-matched normal controls to assign abnormal values. A unilateral reduction in hippocampal volume is a reliable indicator of the epileptogenic temporal lobe in patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients with bilateral hippocampal atrophy or hippocampal atrophy contralateral to the site of seizure onset are more likely to experience adverse cognitive outcomes following temporal lobe surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957483\"><span class=\"h2\">FDG-PET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of interictal cerebral glucose metabolism using [18F]-2-deoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) is a sensitive functional neuroimaging technique in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Unilateral temporal lobe hypometabolism on FDG-PET (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75459\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75459 \">image 4</a>) correlates strongly with the temporal lobe of seizure origin and is predictive of seizure freedom following epilepsy surgery, independent of structural MRI findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. FDG-PET can also be clinically useful in patients with extratemporal regions of seizure onset. This includes individuals with focal cortical dysplasia who may have an unremarkable MRI study. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-in-the-evaluation-of-seizures-and-epilepsy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging in the evaluation of seizures and epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Positron emission tomography'</a>.)</p><p>FDG-PET and MRI coregistration increases the diagnostic yield of preoperative imaging and may improve surgical outcome in patients with negative MRI studies and focal cortical dysplasia. In such patients, <span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/MRI</span> demonstrates a hypometabolic zone indicative of the site of focal cortical dysplasia and the region of seizure onset. This modality is highly sensitive in detecting focal cortical dysplasia type II (Taylor-type) in patients with a normal brain MRI, and it may improve outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H2957658\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957542\"><span class=\"h2\">Ictal SPECT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ictal SPECT studies are used to map increased cerebral blood flow during seizures to assist in localizing the epileptogenic zone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97084\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97084 \">image 5</a>). While not technically feasible at all institutions due to logistic constraints of ictal tracer injection, SPECT is particularly useful in patients with a conflicting noninvasive epilepsy evaluation with regard to localization of the epileptic brain tissue. SPECT findings can also influence the diagnostic strategy for placement of intracranial EEG electrodes. (See <a href=\"#H2957605\" class=\"local\">'Seizure localization'</a> below.)</p><p>SPECT studies involve cerebral blood flow imaging using radiopharmaceuticals, most often either technetium-99m-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO) or 99mTc-bicisate, that have a rapid first-pass brain extraction with maximum uptake being achieved within 30 to 60 seconds of an intravenous injection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-in-the-evaluation-of-seizures-and-epilepsy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging in the evaluation of seizures and epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Single-photon emission computed tomography'</a>.)</p><p>Subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM) is a modification of the ictal SPECT technique that superimposes ictal and interictal SPECT images and brain MRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97084\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97084 \">image 5</a>). SISCOM has been used in patients with normal MRI studies, those with multifocal EEG or MRI abnormalities, and individuals with intractable epilepsy who are being considered for reoperation. In a series of 51 patients undergoing surgical evaluation, SISCOM had a significantly higher rate of localization (88 versus 39 percent), better interobserver agreement, and better predictive value for surgical outcome compared with visual inspection of interictal and ictal images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Some of the limitations of visual inspection may be overcome by statistic parametric mapping methods, which permit better localization of the focal hyperperfusion abnormality concordant with the epileptogenic zone in patients with both temporal lobe and extratemporal epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957554\"><span class=\"h2\">Speech and language localization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In selected patients, eloquent cortex involved with speech and language function must be well defined before temporal lobe and frontal lobe resections in order to minimize operative morbidity. The standard method for determining critical areas of functional cortex is intraoperative electrical cortical stimulation. If necessary, this can be carried out<strong> </strong>intraoperatively in awake patients, or extraoperatively using implanted subdural electrodes for long-term intracranial EEG monitoring.</p><p>Preoperatively, functional MRI and the intracarotid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amobarbital</a> procedure (also called the Wada test) are two methods used to assess language localization and predict postoperative language and memory outcomes. Functional MRI is generally preferred over intracarotid amobarbital given its superior safety profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional MRI is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique that is capable of language localization as well as lateralization of language processes. In many epilepsy centers, this has largely replaced intracarotid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amobarbital</a> procedures. Functional MRI can also be used to assess sensory and motor eloquent cortices and as an alternative or adjunct to the Wada test in predicting neurocognitive sequelae after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/11-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-19</a>].

Discordance rates may be slightly higher in patients with extratemporal foci and larger lesions. In one study that measured language outcomes after anterior temporal lobectomy in patients with discordant functional MRI and Wada testing preoperatively, functional MRI provided a more accurate prediction of language outcome in 7 of 10 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, some patients cannot complete functional MRI, or have inconclusive results, and still require preoperative Wada testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Amobarbital or another anesthetic is injected into the internal carotid artery, temporarily suppressing function on that side while language and memory tests are performed. Neuropsychologic testing after intracarotid injection of amobarbital allows for assessment of language and memory function in each hemisphere independently. While complications are reported in up to 11 percent of patients, serious adverse events (stroke, carotid dissection, localized bleeding, and infection) occur in less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other anesthetic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methohexital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methohexital</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> have been investigated as alternatives to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amobarbital</a>, which has not been consistently available.

Approximately three-quarters of the patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings consistent with hippocampal sclerosis, 10 to 15 percent had structural lesions such as tumors or vascular malformations, and approximately 15 percent had normal MRI scans. Patients were randomly assigned to surgery or continued antiseizure drug treatment. At one year, the cumulative proportion of patients who were free of seizures that impaired awareness was significantly greater in the surgery group than the medical group (58 versus 8 percent). Quality-of-life ratings were also higher in the postsurgical group.</p><p>A second randomized, controlled study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of early surgery versus continued medical management in patients who had failed two antiseizure drug trials, but the trial was stopped early because of slow enrollment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

There are also increased concerns regarding clinically functional cortex.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of neocortical epilepsy depend on the area of cortex involved. Seizures arising from functional cortex can be localized based on neurologic symptoms that occur at seizure onset or during the postictal state. Compared with mesial temporal lobe seizures, lateral temporal neocortical seizures are more likely to manifest as experiential auras and less likely to manifest as epigastric auras and contralateral dystonia. Frontal lobe seizures tend to be shorter and more frequent than temporal lobe seizures, with manifestations varying from motionless staring to violent automatisms. Frontal lobe seizures are often confined to sleep. Parietal and occipital seizures typically have complex sensory symptoms such as visual hallucinations of objects or scenes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Neocortical epilepsy'</a>.)</p><p>Despite these general principles, extrahippocampal focal seizures often have varied clinical semiology and can be difficult to localize with scalp-recorded ictal EEG studies. In addition, ictal behaviors may relate to seizure propagation and provide few clues regarding the site of actual seizure onset. Another challenge to clinical localization in neocortical epilepsy is that seizures may be tonic-clonic without a clinically recognized focal seizure, or the focal seizure may be very brief or subtle, such as a brief stare with arrest of activity or hypermotor activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2957605\"><span class=\"h3\">Seizure localization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to adequately localize seizures and tailor resections to spare eloquent cortex, the surgical evaluation in patients with neocortical epilepsy often includes functional or metabolic imaging and long-term intracranial EEG monitoring.</p><p>Before invasive EEG recordings, patients usually undergo functional neuroimaging to include PET <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in an attempt to better localize the epileptogenic zone and direct intracranial electrode placement. The diagnostic yield of PET and SPECT in patients with neocortical epilepsy depends on multiple factors, including the underlying pathology, localization of the epileptogenic zone, and the specific neuroimaging technique. PET or SPECT studies may permit an anterior temporal lobe resection in patients with unilateral temporal lobe scalp-recorded seizures and negative brain MRI scans. Individuals with extratemporal seizures and normal brain MRIs almost invariably require intracranial EEG recordings or functional mapping for surgical localization, or both.</p><p>The strategy for intracranial EEG recordings often includes a combination of subdural strips or grids of electrodes and depth electrodes. Depth electrodes are implanted stereotactically by a neurosurgical team using brain imaging for localization. In two retrospective series of more than 400 patients, the major complication rate of invasive monitoring was 7 to 9 percent; the majority of these complications were either intracranial hemorrhage or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Use of subdural electrodes may pose higher risk than use of depth electrodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].</p><p>Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is another invasive technique that is being increasingly used to evaluate patients with nonlesional drug-resistant focal epilepsy being considered for surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. SEEG may be preferred in individuals with epileptogenic zones that are difficult to evaluate with subdural grid recordings, such as the insula, the depth of sulci, and mesial regions of cerebral cortex. In selected patients being considered for focal cortical resection, the effectiveness and safety of SEEG compares favorably with other methodologies for intracranial EEG recording [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>], with a pooled complication rate of 1.3 percent across multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>In some cases, patients who undergo a full surgical evaluation for nonlesional epilepsy, including intracranial EEG monitoring, are deemed poor candidates for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Low-grade, slowly growing tumors are most commonly associated with a chronic seizure disorder. Gangliogliomas and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNET) together account for approximately three-quarters of all tumors found in adults undergoing epilepsy surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other examples include pilocytic astrocytoma, gangliocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma.</p><p>Imaging features common to all these tumors include typically small size, location at or near a cortical surface, sharply defined borders, little or no surrounding edema, and, with the exception of pilocytic astrocytoma, little or no contrast enhancement. In a series of 133 patients from one institution who underwent operations for extratemporal epilepsy, tumors were identified in 28 percent of cases. These included, in order of decreasing frequency, astrocytoma, ganglioglioma, DNET, glioneuronal hamartoma, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

A review of 29 relevant studies found seizure-freedom rates ranging from 58 to 100 percent (median 86 percent) with a median follow-up of four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The median age at the time of surgery was 18 years. Among 12 studies that reported rates of antiseizure drug discontinuation, approximately half of seizure-free patients were off all antiseizure drugs. The most commonly identified predictors of seizure freedom were younger age at the time of surgery, shorter duration of epilepsy, and complete resection. In a separate study that included 79 patients with DNET with long-term follow-up, the rate of long-term seizure freedom was 42 percent at 10 years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7379297\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular malformations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations are the most common vascular lesions found in patients with focal epilepsy.

Limited data suggest that use of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with display of optic radiation tractography during surgery, where available, may help to minimize risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p>VFDs can improve somewhat from the initial postoperative defect, and driving restrictions based upon this deficit should be reevaluated up to one to two years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].

Risk factors include a personal or family history of psychiatric disease, poor family and psychosocial support, and certain personality traits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/1,120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,120,121</a>].

Long remissions can occur after a relapse; however, these remissions are associated with a poorer outcome than an equivalent period of complete seizure remission immediately following surgery. Similarly, some patients will relapse after an extended period of remission, but these patients usually do not become medically intractable. Patients who develop recurrent intractability are usually identifiable within several months after surgery.</p><p>Patients and families understandably hope that antiseizure drugs can be tapered and withdrawn after surgery. The rationale for reducing antiseizure drugs includes avoidance of drug interactions and dose-related adverse effects, as well as concerns regarding teratogenesis. Patients often believe that medication is unnecessary if they have had &quot;successful&quot; surgery, and thus perceive continued use of antiseizure drugs as an unwanted reminder of a disease process that is no longer an active issue for them.</p><p>There are no prospective, randomized data evaluating discontinuation of antiseizure drugs following epilepsy surgery. A review of six retrospective studies including 611 children and adults followed for one to six years postoperatively noted the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean seizure recurrence rate was 34 percent after planned discontinuation of antiseizure drugs in patients who were seizure free after epilepsy surgery (most often temporal lobe surgery).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The seizure recurrence rate increased during years one to three of follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 90 percent of adults who had recurrent seizures regained control with reinstitution of previous antiseizure drug therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of recurrent seizures was not affected by the duration of postoperative antiseizure drug treatment, suggesting that there is no value to treating for a specified period of time before attempting to stop therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No factors were identified that predicted the risk of relapse after tapering antiseizure drugs, despite looking at factors such as duration of epilepsy, age at onset of epilepsy, and preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, it is not clear whether any of these factors would be predictive of relapse in a prospective, randomized study.</p><p/><p>There are compelling reasons for patients to be considered for antiseizure drug taper and withdrawal following epilepsy surgery. These include antiseizure drug adverse effects, potential drug interactions, cost of therapy, and pregnancy-related considerations. Such factors are weighed against the risk of recurrent seizures, which may affect legal driving status. In practice, most individuals are not considered for antiseizure drug withdrawal unless they are seizure free for at least one year following surgery. Those with auras or seizure activity following surgery should probably remain on antiseizure drug therapy unless they are seizure free for two to five years.</p><p>There is controversy regarding the utility of electroencephalography (EEG) postoperatively to predict the likelihood of seizure recurrence with drug discontinuation. The emergence of epileptiform activity during the drug taper may be associated with an increased risk of seizure activity. We typically determine an antiseizure drug level and perform an EEG prior to antiseizure drug taper and withdrawal. When the decision is made to taper, an antiseizure drug is usually withdrawn over several weeks. Long tapering schedules (eg, a year or longer) have not been shown to be beneficial.</p><p>Most, but not all, individuals who have seizure activity associated with antiseizure drug termination will become seizure free again with reinstitution of medical treatment. Even if all antiseizure drugs cannot be tapered, many patients are successfully tapered to antiseizure drug monotherapy, which may minimize adverse effects, cost of therapy, and potential drug interactions. The goal of surgery remains to render the patient seizure free, with or without continued antiseizure drug treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7379345\"><span class=\"h1\">TRENDS IN EPILEPSY SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite a large and growing body of evidence supporting the benefit of epilepsy surgery in carefully selected patients with drug refractory epilepsy, surgery remains underutilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/126-131\" class=\"abstract_t\">126-131</a>]. A population-based study utilizing the United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample found that there were 6653 resective surgeries from 1990 to 2008, and there was no growth trend over this time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. By contrast, a similar study examining pediatric epilepsy surgery trends in the United States found that rates of epilepsy surgery incrementally rose from 1997 to 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p>At the same time, there is evidence that the patient population undergoing surgical treatment at large epilepsy centers has changed. In several studies, the absolute number of anterior temporal lobe resections, as well as the percentage of epilepsy surgeries comprising anterior temporal resections, has decreased over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/133-135\" class=\"abstract_t\">133-135</a>]. The reasons for decreased utilization of the most common operative procedure for epilepsy are not clear. At many epilepsy centers, an increasing number of patients referred for consideration of surgery have negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, multifocal seizures, or indeterminate outpatient diagnostic evaluations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2917500880\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of drug-resistant epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical evaluation is recommended for patients with refractory focal seizures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The most favorable candidates are those with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-identified lesions that correlate with the electrophysiologic localization of seizure onset. (See <a href=\"#H7378479\" class=\"local\">'Surgical candidates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of the surgical evaluation are to identify the epileptogenic zone fully and avoid operative morbidity associated with a focal cortical resection. Standard components of the surgical evaluation include detailed neurologic history and examination, neuropsychologic testing, routine electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with standard activating procedures, inpatient long-term video-EEG monitoring in an epilepsy monitoring unit, high-resolution brain MRI, and functional and metabolic imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Preoperative formal speech and language testing and visual field examinations are also performed in selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H7379259\" class=\"local\">'Surgical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adult patients, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to mesial temporal sclerosis is the most frequently encountered surgically remediable epileptic syndrome. The most common surgical procedure is an anterior temporal resection in which the temporal pole is removed along with the hippocampus and part of the amygdala. The best surgical candidates are those patients with focal, unilateral brain lesions (eg, mesial temporal sclerosis, tumor, or vascular malformation) that correlate with focal-onset seizures localizing to the ipsilateral temporal lobe. (See <a href=\"#H7379271\" class=\"local\">'Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with focal seizures of neocortical origin and normal brain MRI scans may also be candidates for epilepsy surgery, but management is often more challenging because of difficulty lateralizing and localizing the epileptogenic zone, difficulty defining the extent of brain tissue that must be resected for seizure freedom, and concerns regarding functional cortex. (See <a href=\"#H7379278\" class=\"local\">'Neocortical epilepsy with normal brain MRI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-grade primary brain tumors, vascular malformations, and malformations of cortical development (MCDs) are other causes of refractory focal epilepsy. Resection of the epileptogenic brain region often results in improved seizure control. Outcomes are typically better for patients with tumors and vascular malformations than for patients with focal cortical dysplasia. (See <a href=\"#H7379284\" class=\"local\">'Lesional epilepsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epilepsy surgery is associated with low rates of morbidity and mortality when performed at specialized centers. The most common adverse effects related to epilepsy surgery are cognitive impairment and visual field defects (VFDs).
