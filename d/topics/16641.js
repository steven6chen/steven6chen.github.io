Emergent abdominal surgical exploration is indicated for the hemodynamically unstable trauma patient who has a positive focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST exam) or diagnostic peritoneal <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/lavage</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(DPA/DPL)</span> to control life-threatening hemorrhage, which may be due to an injured spleen.

However, observational management requires adequate resources, and if unavailable, initial surgical management should be considered depending on the patient's medical comorbidities.

The spleen is surrounded by a fibrous capsule composed of collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle. The spleen is important for opsonization of encapsulated organisms. Splenic physiology is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;, section on 'Normal splenic function'</a>.)</p><p>The spleen is predominantly perfused by the splenic artery, which is a branch of the celiac trunk. Splenic blood flow is also derived from the short gastric arteries, which are branches of the left gastric artery. The splenic artery, which can be quite tortuous, traverses along the superior margin of the pancreas, supplying branches to it, before continuing to the spleen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68680\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68680 \">figure 2</a>). The splenic artery branches to form up to six major arteries before entering the splenic hilum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78584\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78584 \">figure 3</a>). Each branch runs in the transverse axis of the spleen, progressively branching to peripheral arterioles that open freely into the splenic pulp. The blood flows through the reticular tissue and is collected in the terminal venules, which join to form larger veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69582 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>The veins do not accompany the arteries within the spleen. At the hilum, up to six major veins unite to form the splenic vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78584\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78584 \">figure 3</a>). The splenic vein joins the superior mesenteric vein to form the portal vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68680\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68680 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Type and crossmatch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least 4 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs) should be available for transfusion in the event the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. A &quot;massive transfusion protocol&quot; should be immediately available for all hemodynamically unstable patients and include preparation of packed RBC, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or similar products (eg, PF24), and platelets. Some trauma patients may be candidates for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> within three hours of injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics are administered to prevent surgical site infection. For emergent trauma surgery, antibiotic selection is the same as for elective surgery with administration of a first-generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If there is concern for or confirmed enteric or colorectal contamination, anaerobic coverage with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> or, alternatively, a higher-generation cephalosporin is appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">urgent/emergent</span> nature of a trauma laparotomy precludes the ability to immunize the patient prior to possible splenectomy. In general, patients are immunized in the postoperative period if splenectomy is required.

Hypothermia adversely impacts enzyme kinetics, including those important for clotting, and therefore measures to impede heat loss should be instituted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These include elevating the operating room temperature (&gt;85&ordm;F [25&ordm;C]), administering warmed fluids through an appropriate infusion device, and using other warming devices, such as a warm water heating pad or forced air convective heating blanket (eg, Bair hugger).</p><p>The skin is prepared (eg, chlorhexidine-alcohol) from the suprasternal notch to the mid-thighs, encompassing the entire anterior and lateral surfaces of the abdomen and chest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H24969720\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Skin antisepsis'</a>.)</p><p>Autotransfusion devices may be used for red blood cell scavenging from extra-abdominal cavities (eg, pleural spaces) and combined with red cell scavenging devices in the operating room (eg, cell saver) provided gross peritoneal soilage from intestinal injury is absent. These techniques are part of a patient blood management program to minimize allogeneic exposure to nonautologous blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Blood salvage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An exploratory laparotomy should be performed whenever the spleen requires surgical intervention due to trauma. All intraperitoneal structures are inspected, and the retroperitoneum explored as needed, depending upon the zone of retroperitoneal injury (eg, mandatory exploration for central [zone 1] injuries) and whether the mechanism is blunt or penetrating.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A midline incision is performed because it is rapid and allows for complete visualization and mobilization of intraperitoneal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> retroperitoneal structures. While the flank and chevron incision are appropriate for elective splenic surgery, we avoid these incisions in managing the injured spleen because entry into the abdomen is slower and exposure is more limited compared with that of the midline approach.</p><p>The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and midline fascia (linea alba) are incised, leaving the peritoneum intact. Then, anesthesia personnel are informed and should be prepared for blood loss, which may occur once the tamponade of the closed abdomen is released during the opening of the peritoneum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Packing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after opening the peritoneum, the abdomen is packed in all four quadrants. Laparotomy pads are first packed in quadrants where active extravasation has been noted on preoperative imaging studies or where bleeding appears most significant. The left upper quadrant is packed by retracting the abdominal wall away from the spleen and placing laparotomy pads into the space between the diaphragm and spleen, and between the lateral abdominal wall and spleen. Additional packs are placed between the spleen and splenic flexure of the colon, and anterior to the spleen. This method creates a &quot;sandwich,&quot; compressing the spleen between the laparotomy pads, which helps tamponade any active bleeding.</p><p>In cases where a laparotomy pad count has not been performed prior to packing, and the abdomen is to be closed, a plain radiograph should be taken at the end of the operation to document whether or not any laparotomy pads have been left in place (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64696\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64696 \">image 1</a>). For those patients who are managed with an open abdomen approach (damage control laparotomy), a confirmatory radiograph should be obtained when the operating team believes that they have removed all of the laparotomy pads that were left in place for hemorrhage control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To explore the abdomen, the abdominal packs are deliberately removed in reverse order, and active bleeding is controlled as it is encountered before addressing any gastrointestinal contamination. The spleen can remain packed while addressing more urgent injuries, providing the packs adequately control the bleeding. Alternatively, if the spleen is suspected to be the sole or primary source of hemorrhage, it can be addressed first and the remaining packs can be left in place.</p><p>After more life-threatening injuries have been addressed, attention can be directed toward the left-upper quadrant. Adequate inspection of the spleen generally requires full mobilization from its attachments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Mobilization of the spleen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenic mobilization is performed by dividing the spleen's ligamentous attachments to the diaphragm, kidney, stomach, and colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52833\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52833 \">figure 5</a>). Once mobilization is complete, packs of laparotomy pads are placed behind and lateral to the spleen. During mobilization, bleeding from the spleen can be controlled by manually compressing the splenic vessels in the splenic hilum.</p><p>The lateral attachments (ie, splenophrenic and splenorenal ligaments) are divided first. This is best accomplished by placing the left hand up and over the diaphragmatic surface of the spleen, gradually and carefully rotating and elevating it medially while dissecting the plane between the pancreas and kidney (eg, Metzenbaum scissors, cautery, blunt dissection).</p><p>The gastrosplenic ligament is divided, and the short gastric vessels contained within it clamped, divided, and suture ligated. Suture ligation is important in managing the short gastric vessels because postoperative gastric distension can push off a simple tie and lead to postoperative bleeding. Care is also taken not to entrap the gastric wall in the suture, which can result in tissue necrosis and gastric perforation. The splenocolic ligament is divided to complete splenic mobilization.</p><p>Following mobilization, the spleen is inspected and an intraoperative splenic injury grade determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of splenic injury in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Splenic injury grading'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SPLENECTOMY VERSUS SALVAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to perform splenectomy versus splenic salvage (ie, splenorrhaphy, partial splenectomy) is made based upon the grade of injury, presence of associated injuries, patient's overall condition, and experience of the surgeon. The small future risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis needs to be balanced against the more significant risk of recurrent hemorrhage.</p><p>Splenectomy is a life-saving procedure when bleeding from the spleen is the cause of hemodynamic instability. Splenic salvage was extensively practiced in the 1980s and up to the mid-1990s; however, splenectomy is consistently more commonly used, likely because more lower-grade injuries in hemodynamically stable patients are managed nonoperatively. When considering splenic salvage, the surgeon must determine whether the patient can tolerate rebleeding and reoperation for the small, but real, risk of recurrent hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Splenectomy is often a more appropriate choice for patients with multiple injuries or comorbidities who may not tolerate a significant or recurrent episode of hypotension or a second surgical procedure.</p><p>Splenectomy is also more appropriate for patients requiring urgent surgical management of other significant injuries that preclude taking the extra time needed for splenic salvage. In the setting of damage control, delayed splenic salvage can be considered (within 24 to 48 hours) for low-grade splenic injuries, provided that the bleeding is controlled with packing. Splenectomy is the safest option, given that most patients who require damage-control surgery are on the brink of physiological collapse; are hypothermic, acidotic, coagulopathic; and will likely only poorly tolerate recurrent hemorrhage.</p><p>Splenectomy may also be the best option for surgeons whose institutional resources cannot support nonoperative management of splenic injury or who do not have adequate experience with splenic salvage. Lower-grade splenic injuries (I to III) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68648\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68648 \">image 2</a>) are the most conducive to splenic salvage techniques; however, the shift toward nonoperative management with angiographic embolization has decreased the number of patients who would be ideal candidates for operative splenic salvage techniques. As such, individual surgeon experience with splenic salvage has declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of splenic injury in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Splenic embolization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SPLENIC SALVAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of splenic salvage techniques published in journals and textbooks, though no formal comparisons have been made. The selection of specific techniques, materials, and sutures are dependent on individual surgeon experience and preference. Observational management, with or without splenic embolization, has made splenic salvage an infrequent procedure in surgical practice. Most patients who fail nonoperative management will require a splenectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Splenorrhaphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenorrhaphy refers to the suture repair of the spleen with or without splenic wrapping and is generally supplemented by electrocautery techniques for control of parenchymal hemorrhage.</p><p>Intraparenchymal bleeding is controlled first, followed by reapproximation of the splenic tissue and capsule when possible. Hemostasis can be achieved with topical hemostatic agents, electrocautery, or argon beam coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The choice depends upon availability and surgeon preference. A mass closure technique using absorbable sutures, with or without supporting pledgets, is used to reapproximate the splenic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. When reapproximation of the tissue is not feasible, due to tissue friability, a tongue of omentum can be laid into the open defect and sutured into place.</p><p>The spleen can be wrapped in an absorbable hemostatic mesh to facilitate tissue approximation and effect tamponade. The use of mesh does not appear to be associated with increased infection rates, even in patients who underwent mesh splenorrhaphy and concomitant bowel repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Splenic wrapping, however, can be time consuming, particularly in inexperienced hands, and has the potential to cause splenic ischemia if the wrapping is too tight at the hilum, or may allow recurrent hemorrhage if the wrap is too loose. Significant residual bleeding in spite of repair indicates the need for splenectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial splenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial splenectomy is a form of splenic salvage and refers to the removal of a portion of the spleen based upon its segmental blood supply. Partial splenectomy leaves behind a raw surface, which may have an unacceptably high risk of recurrent hemorrhage, especially in patients with coagulopathy and those at risk for high venous pressures (eg, portal vein injury, preexisting cirrhosis). Accordingly, partial splenectomy is an infrequently selected technique to manage splenic injury.</p><p>The hilar vessels supplying the irreparably damaged portion of spleen are ligated and divided. After the surface of the spleen demarcates into viable and nonviable portions, the nonviable portion is removed using a scalpel or electrocautery. The cut edge of the remaining spleen is managed with the splenorrhaphy techniques discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy of the spleen'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SPLENECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenectomy removes the entire spleen. Following mobilization, the splenic artery and vein at the hilum are isolated. Each vessel is, ideally, individually ligated and divided to prevent the potential development of an arteriovenous fistula.</p><p>Care is taken during the isolation and ligation of the hilar vessels to identify and avoid injury to the tail of the pancreas, which is adjacent to the splenic hilum.</p><p>Once the spleen is removed, the splenic bed is examined for bleeding. Because the region of the splenic bed is deep in the left upper quadrant, bleeding may not be easily visualized. One useful technique is to roll up a laparotomy pad, place it into the left upper quadrant, and slowly roll it toward the divided hilar vessels. Blood that appears on the pad indicates the location requiring further hemostasis.</p><p>The greater curvature of the stomach is reexamined to ensure control of the divided short gastric vessels. If there is any concern that a tie is encroaching on the gastric wall, that area of gastric wall can be inverted with sutures placed in a Lembert fashion.</p><p>We do not routinely use drains unless there is concern for another injury that might benefit from closed drainage (eg, known or suspected pancreatic injury, renal collecting system injury). (See <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Postsplenectomy sepsis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6820137\"><span class=\"h2\">Replantation of splenic tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If splenectomy for injury is deemed necessary, heterotopic autotransplantation of splenic tissue into omental pockets may provide some splenic function, although this has not been proven conclusively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. One study that compared the computed volume of splenic tissue identified using scintigraphy with red blood cell pit counts found that 20 to 30 cm<sup>3</sup> of implanted tissue was sufficient to provide return of some splenic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, the degree of clinical immunologic protection offered by this splenic tissue is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. </p><p>Deliberate autotransplantation of splenic tissue into omental pockets is a relatively simple procedure but requires a patient without severe concomitant injury who is hemodynamically stable and without acidosis, hypothermia, or coagulopathy. These conditions are rarely met, and thus, heterotopic autotransplantation is generally not performed in the setting of acute injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Autotransplantation, termed splenosis, is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Splenosis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">LAPAROSCOPIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open exploration remains the standard of care for surgical intervention. While the laparoscopic approach has been described in case reports and small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>], a laparoscopic approach to manage splenic injury should only be considered in select cases. As an example, a low-grade injury found during diagnostic laparoscopy for penetrating trauma with minimal-to-no hemorrhage in a hemodynamically stable patient may be amenable to laparoscopic repair or, if needed, laparoscopic splenectomy.</p><p>The laparoscopic approach is hampered by inadequate visualization due to ongoing hemorrhage and potential hypotension (ie, decreased venous return from pneumoperitoneum). Due to the general success of nonoperative management strategies, surgical intervention is more typically performed in patients who are hemodynamically unstable. Under these circumstances, laparoscopic exploration is contraindicated due to the potential for further hemodynamic compromise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the postoperative course following surgical management for splenic injury is dictated by the presence of associated injuries.</p><p>Serial hematocrits and platelet counts are obtained following splenic repair or splenorrhaphy to monitor for postoperative bleeding and thrombocytosis (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Thrombocytosis'</a> below). There is no optimal regimen; however, we check the hematocrit every eight hours for the first 24 hours. Patients who have undergone splenic repair should be monitored similarly to those who are undergoing nonoperative management.

A modest secondary reactive thrombocytosis following injury without splenectomy occurs in approximately 20 percent of patients and is due to increases in circulating thrombopoietin, interleukin-6, and other inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p>Following splenectomy, reactive thrombocytosis occurs in 75 to 82 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The platelet count commonly increases 30 to 100 percent following splenectomy, usually peaking between 7 and 20 days postoperatively, and then falling to normal levels over weeks to months, but sometimes over years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Counts exceeding <span class=\"nowrap\">1,000,000/microL</span> are not uncommon following splenectomy. In a retrospective review of patients with splenic trauma, the platelet count initially increased in all patients with thrombocytosis [platelet count &gt;500 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;500,000/microL],</span> occurring in 41 percent (64 of 156). Thrombocytosis was more likely following splenectomy compared with spleen-preserving strategies (odds ratio [OR] 7.58, 95% CI 2.26-25.45), independent of length of stay, injury grade, injury severity score, age, and transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Extreme thrombocytosis [platelet count &gt;1000 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1,000,000/microL]</span> was more likely following splenectomy compared with spleen-preserving strategies (OR 10.39, 95% CI 3.59-30.07), independent of length of stay. </p><p>Thrombocytosis may cause platelet aggregation, which may lead to vessel thrombosis that is not reliably predictable. Thrombocytosis alone is not usually sufficient to lead to clinically significant thrombosis. While most patients with secondary thrombocytosis do not require specific therapy, postoperative patients at high risk for venous thrombosis (eg, thrombophilia, cancer) who have concomitant thrombocytosis may be treated with antiplatelet therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>). Data are lacking on whether aspirin therapy yields a significant outcome benefit, and for which patient population. Therapy may be instituted when the platelet count exceeds <span class=\"nowrap\">1,000,000/microL,</span> if not contraindicated (eg, cerebral trauma). When extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1,000,000/microL)</span> is coupled with evidence of venous or arterial thrombosis, additional treatment may be required to treat symptoms. The management of patients with thrombophilia and acute thrombosis is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Thrombocytosis may increase the risk for venous or arterial thrombosis following splenectomy, though the relationship between thrombocytosis and thrombosis remains unclear.

Splenic preservation in patients with blunt splenic injury by operative or nonoperative management has been reported to lead to lower early infection rates (in adults) compared with splenectomy. As an example, one prospective study reported adult patients managed with observation, splenic repair, and splenectomy had postoperative infection rates of 5, 15, and 49 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. It is unclear whether the determining factor was the preservation of splenic tissue, or a reflection of injury severity allowing observation or requiring splenectomy. Pneumonia was the most common postoperative infection in all three groups, but not all infections were due to encapsulated organisms.</p><p>Intra-abdominal abscess complicates splenectomy in 3 to 13 percent of patients and is associated with concomitant intestinal tract injuries and the presence of splenic bed drains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Postsplenectomy sepsis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postsplenectomy sepsis is a fulminant and rapidly fatal illness due to encapsulated pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. The incidence of postsplenectomy sepsis associated with splenic injury appears to be lower than that for splenectomy performed for other indications. Autotransplantation of splenic tissue at the time of the injury (ie, splenosis) may provide a critical mass of splenic tissue to confer some degree of splenic immunocompetence to the patient, although this is not reliably established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].
