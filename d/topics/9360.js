Although never studied in randomized trials, observational studies have clearly demonstrated that intrauterine transfusion (IUT) of the severely anemic fetus improves survival. Universal use of prophylactic Rh(D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> has reduced the need for IUT dramatically; however, the procedure continues to be an essential modality for treatment of severe fetal anemia from a variety of causes, such as non-Rh(D) alloimmunization, parvovirus B19 infection, chronic fetomaternal hemorrhage, and homozygous alpha-thalassemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We consider pregnancies with severe fetal anemia at 18 to 35 weeks of gestation optimal candidates for IUT. We obtain fetal blood via percutaneous umbilical blood sampling for <span class=\"nowrap\">hematocrit/hemoglobin</span> determination when the fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity is greater than 1.50 multiples of the median and perform the first IUT if fetal hemoglobin is two standard deviations below the mean value for gestational age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53399 \">table 1</a>). Intervention at this moderately reduced hemoglobin level results in a better fetal outcome than waiting until development of severe anemia (hemoglobin level more than <span class=\"nowrap\">7&nbsp;g/dL&nbsp;below</span> the normal mean for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]) or hydrops (actual hemoglobin level &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A hematocrit less than 30 percent can also be used as the threshold for fetal transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The procedure is generally limited to pregnancies between 18 and 35 weeks of gestation because before 18 weeks the small size of the relevant anatomic structures causes technical challenges and after 35 weeks IUT is considered riskier than delivery followed by postnatal transfusion therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>For the rare patient with very early (&le;18 weeks) severe alloimmunization, plasma exchange and administration of intravenous immunoglobulin G may maintain the fetal hematocrit above life-threatening levels long enough to achieve a gestational age when IUT is technically feasible.

The requirement for a pre-donation hemoglobin above 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> will exclude many pregnant women as potential donors. We advise pregnant women who donate blood to consume a daily prenatal vitamin, as well as supplemental iron (325 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> twice daily) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> (1 mg daily).

Observational studies of women undergoing IUT have reported that about 25 percent produce additional RBC antibodies due to feto-maternal transfer of donor RBCs with foreign antigens or fetal blood with foreign paternal antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The risk is highest when the IUT necessitates passing a needle through the placenta. Matching the donor and mother for D, C, c, E, e, and K antigens does not eliminate the risk of new maternal antibody formation because differences in other minor antigens still exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The RBCs may have a longer half-life, which would decrease the total number of IUTs necessary for treatment. A study comparing 76 IUTs in which maternal RBCs was used to 213 IUTs in which donor RBCs were used reported the rate of decline of the fetal hematocrit between IUT procedures was significantly slower in fetuses that received maternal blood, although this difference was not evident until after 33 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Neonates that received maternal blood required fewer transfusions than neonates whose transfusion came from other donors. The authors hypothesized that the lower transfusion requirements were related to use of blood with a high proportion of young cells (with a longer half-life) as a result of increased maternal reticulocytosis after repeated maternal donations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of transmission of blood-borne viral infections may be lower, but this has not been studied.</p><p/><p>In contrast to blood donation from the usual blood donor, pregnant blood donors are placed in the left lateral recumbent position during the donation and the donated volume is replaced with isotonic intravenous fluids. Fetal monitoring during blood donation is unnecessary. A standard volume of 450 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 45 mL is withdrawn, as subsequent washing and packing will markedly reduce the final volume available for IUT. The donated unit can be separated into two smaller aliquots and refrigerated for up to 42 days; however, prolonged refrigeration compromises freshness. Blood can be frozen within six days of collection for future use. </p><p>A unit donated by the mother for her fetus undergoes additional processing compared with non-maternal donor units. It is washed several times to remove the problem antibody. Since the mother and fetus share human leukocyte antigens (HLA) at many loci, the possibility of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is higher than with use of an unrelated donor unit where HLA mismatch enables the recipient's immune system to destroy the donor lymphocytes. To avoid transfusion-associated GVHD, the unit is irradiated.</p><p>The use of maternal blood in the CMV-seropositive mother is controversial since dormant CMV can reside in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukoreduction is an effective mechanism for preventing the transmission of CMV. The known and possible risks and benefits of use of blood from CMV-seropositive mothers should be discussed with the mother in consultation with the blood bank service.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523785270\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal siblings as donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mother's siblings can be tested as potential red cell donors.

Some clinicians administer a prophylactic antibiotic such as a first generation cephalosporin (1 to 2 grams within one hour of the start of the procedure); no data are available on the value of antibiotic prophylaxis in this setting.

The various points of access for IUT have not been compared in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>We prefer intravascular fetal transfusion (IVT) to intraperitoneal transfusion (IPT) because of higher survival rates, particularly in hydropic fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. We target the umbilical vein because of ease of access and greater safety compared with other vascular sites. Umbilical artery puncture results in a higher incidence of bradycardia than umbilical vein puncture, probably due to spasm of the muscularis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Direct cardiac puncture is rarely performed because of a higher risk of severe complications, including fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p>Gestational age and fetal ascites are other considerations. IVT early in the second trimester (&lt;22 weeks) is technically challenging, particularly if the mother is obese. In these cases, use of IPT followed by IVT when technically feasible can be the best approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. IPT is less effective in fetal ascites due to poor absorption of the intraperitoneal blood; IVT should be performed in these cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541254579\"><span class=\"h3\">Umbilical vein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>North American centers typically target the umbilical vein at the placental end of the cord insertion, while many European centers target the intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein. Either target is reasonable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541254585\"><span class=\"h4\">Umbilical cord at placental insertion site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We puncture the umbilical vein in the portion of umbilical cord near its insertion into the placenta. Puncture of a free-floating middle segment of cord or the cord insertion proximate to the fetal umbilicus is undesirable because manipulation of the cord at these sites is more likely to result in fetal bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Free-floating midsegments of the umbilical cord have the additional problem of readily floating away from the needle when cord penetration is attempted. Cord movement is minimal where it is anchored by the placenta.</p><p>If the umbilical vein in the portion of umbilical cord near its insertion into the placenta is not accessible due to fetal position and posterior placentation, the intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein is a reasonable option when the fetus is appropriately positioned. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541254617\"><span class=\"h4\">Intrahepatic umbilical vein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion into the intrahepatic umbilical vein is an acceptable alternative to transfusion at the placental insertion site as long as the fetal spine is towards the maternal back to allow access to the liver. The procedure-related fetal loss rate appears to be similar to, or less than, that with puncture of the umbilical vein at placental insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/18,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22</a>]. </p><p>Two advantages of puncture of the intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein are (1) a low incidence of fetal bradycardia, probably due to absence of inadvertent umbilical artery puncture at this anatomical level, and (2) blood loss from the cord puncture site is compensated, at least in part, by its subsequent absorption from the peritoneal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>A disadvantage of the intrahepatic umbilical vein site is that it may be more painful for the fetus. The fetal stress hormones noradrenaline, cortisol, and beta-endorphin have been reported to increase with intrahepatic puncture, a response not seen with procedures at the placental insertion site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Another concern is that fetal movement during intrahepatic umbilical vein transfusion places the fetus at higher risk of organ trauma from a dislodged needle than when transfusion is performed at other sites. This can be avoided by administering a drug to induce fetal paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] or not holding the transfusion needle in a fixed position during the infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541254705\"><span class=\"h3\">Peritoneal cavity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPT provides indirect access to the fetal circulation. It utilizes the principle that fluid and cells in the peritoneal cavity are absorbed through the subdiaphragmatic lymphatics and thoracic duct. In the hydropic fetus, however, a functional blockage of the lymphatic system probably exists and prevents good absorption of red blood cells (RBCs). Thus, the procedure is least effective in those fetuses who are most severely anemic and in need of treatment. In a study of hydropic and nonhydropic fetuses matched for severity of disease, placental location, and gestational age at the first transfusion, IVT approximately doubled the survival rate in hydropic fetuses and increased survival by 13 percent in nonhydropic fetuses compared with IPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Given the higher rate of survival with IVT, it is the preferred method for transfusing the anemic fetus. However, IPT remains a viable option when fetal vascular access is difficult because of early gestational age or fetal position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541254739\"><span class=\"h3\">Combined approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author uses a combined approach (IVT followed by IPT) as this provides a more stable fetal hematocrit between procedures, presumably due to slow absorption of RBCs from the intraperitoneal reservoir. This allows a longer interval between procedures, so fewer IUTs are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Packed RBCs are administered by IVT to achieve a final fetal hematocrit of 35 to 40 percent, immediately followed by a standard IPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] (see <a href=\"#H541254705\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal cavity'</a> above). The decline in fetal hematocrit between procedures is markedly reduced with this approach when compared with IVT alone (0.1 versus 1 percent decline per day).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69347\"><span class=\"h2\">Calculating transfusion volume</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69378\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravascular transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of blood transfusion for IVT depends upon the initial fetal hematocrit, size of the fetus, the hematocrit of the transfused RBCs, and the target hematocrit. The acute correction of severe fetal anemia is associated with profound hemodynamic changes. For example, cardiac output falls markedly due to the acute increase in afterload, and viscosity markedly increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These abrupt hemodynamic changes are most stressful for fetuses at earlier gestational ages. Therefore, we use a lower target hematocrit for the first IUT in fetuses under 24 weeks than for older fetuses.</p><p>Fetal hematocrit normally increases linearly across gestation. The normal fetal hematocrit is 37&plusmn;4 percent at 17 weeks rising to 43&plusmn;7 percent at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Before 24 weeks, we aim for a first post-transfusion hematocrit below 25 percent or less than a fourfold increase from the pre-transfusion value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A second IVT is performed within 48 hours to bring the hematocrit to the normal range and a third IVT is scheduled in 7 to 10 days.</p><p>After 24 weeks of gestation, our target hematocrit is 40 to 50 percent, consistent with expert guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. We avoid transfusing the fetus to supraphysiologic hematocrit values (50 to 65 percent), as is done in some centers, because this level of hematocrit is associated with a marked rise in whole blood viscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], which can lead to complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>The simplest method of calculating the volume of packed RBCs to be infused assumes the donor unit has a hematocrit of approximately 75 percent and uses a series of coefficients for increasing the initial fetal hematocrit by specific increments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50073\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50073 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. As an example, to increase the hematocrit of a 1000 gram fetus from 20 to 40 percent, one multiplies 0.04 (coefficient for raising the hematocrit by 20) and 1000 (the estimated fetal weight in grams) to yield 40 mL (the volume that needs to be transfused).</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Another formula for calculating the amount of blood to be transfused is [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]: Volume transfused (mL) = volume of fetoplacental unit (mL) x (final - initial hematocrit) divided by the hematocrit of the transfused blood. The fetoplacental volume (mL) is calculated from the ultrasound estimate of the fetal weight according to the formula (1.046 + fetal weight in grams x 0.14).</p></div></div><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69511\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraperitoneal transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The formula for the volume of intraperitoneal transfusion was determined many years ago to allow for the maximum infusion of RBCs without compromising umbilical venous blood flow due to excessive intra-abdominal pressure. The calculation involves subtracting 20 from the gestational age in weeks and multiplying by 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, a 30 week fetus would receive 100 mL of blood. Blood in the peritoneal reservoir can be expected to be absorbed over a 7 to 10 day period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uterus is displaced to the left to reduce the risk of maternal hypotension and the abdomen is prepared and draped as for a surgical procedure. One operator provides continuous ultrasound guidance using a transducer covered with a sterile sleeve. </p><p>For IUT into the umbilical vein, the first operator identifies the access site and a second operator infiltrates the maternal skin with a local anesthetic and then directs a 20-gauge six-inch needle into the vein. A 22-gauge needle can be used for pregnancies under 22 weeks.</p><p>An initial sample of blood is withdrawn for complete blood count and reticulocyte count. We use a portable automated hemocytometer because it provides results quickly and, in contrast to a spun capillary hematocrit, it gives mean corpuscular red cell volume (MCV), which affirms that fetal, as opposed to maternal, blood has been obtained before the first one or two transfusions (MCV greater than 100 mL suggests fetal RBCs). Injecting saline and seeing turbulence in the umbilical vein is another method of confirming that the needle position is correct.</p><p>After withdrawing a blood sample, we give a short acting paralytic agent to minimize fetal movement and, in turn, needle dislodgement. Options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a> (0.1 mg per kg of ultrasound estimated fetal weight [EFW]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atracurium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atracurium</a> besylate (0.4 mg per kg of EFW) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. These drugs provide fetal paralysis for up to one to two hours and have minimal cardiovascular effects. Fetal paralysis appears to improve the safety of fetal transfusion, and has been reported to prevent 80 percent of procedure-related fetal heart rate changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. We also administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> of EFW) for fetal sedation; it is mixed in the same syringe as the paralytic agent.</p><p>If fetal anemia is confirmed (fetal hemoglobin two standard deviations below the mean value for gestational age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53399 \">table 1</a>) or hematocrit &lt;30 percent), the second or third operator infuses packed RBCs using a 20 mL syringe attached to a three-way stopcock connected, via extension tubing, to the blood bag and the procedure needle. A nonluer lock stopcock is used to connect the procedure needle and distal end of the extension tubing to facilitate manipulation of the tubing without disturbing the needle. During the infusion, the transfused blood should be visible streaming away from the needle in the umbilical vein as it mixes with fetal blood.</p><p>The fetal heart rate should be monitored periodically using color flow or pulsed Doppler ultrasound. Swirling at the tip of the needle (as opposed to streaming inside the vein away from the tip of the needle) suggests a fall in fetal cardiac output and should prompt fetal heart rate assessment. If a deceleration is noted, we initially stop the infusion and then restart at a slower rate after the fetal heart rate recovers. If the deceleration does not resolve after 30 seconds, however, the procedure needle should be removed and the mother should be turned to the left lateral decubitus position and given oxygen. The fetal heart rate is continuously monitored by ultrasound. We perform an emergency cesarean delivery in pregnancies of a viable gestational age when fetal myocardial contractility is severely depressed (ie, no opening and closing of the atrioventricular values) or a deceleration persists for more than three minutes with no sign of resolution.</p><p>When the infusion is completed, another fetal blood sample is obtained to check the post-transfusion hematocrit. After the second and subsequent transfusions, we also perform a Kleihauer-Betke test or fetal cell staining using flow cytometry to determine the proportion of adult RBCs, which indicates the extent of suppression of fetal erythropoiesis as a result of transfusion. </p><p>The fetal heart rate is monitored until fetal movement resumes and a reactive nonstress test (appropriate for gestational age) is documented. An ultrasound examination is scheduled for the following day, as most cases of fetal loss occur within the first 24 hours post-procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Scheduling the second and subsequent transfusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our goal is to maintain the fetal hematocrit above 25 percent. We empirically transfuse 10 days, two weeks, and three weeks after the first, second, and third transfusion, respectively. Another reasonable approach is to base the interval between transfusions on the expected decline in fetal hemoglobin of 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL/day,</span> 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL/day,</span> and 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL/day</span> after the first, second, and third transfusion, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, the immediate post-procedure hemoglobin may not reflect the hemoglobin when the fetus is stable due to fluid shifts from the extravascular to the intravascular compartment and bleeding from the cord puncture site when the needle is removed. </p><p>The interval between subsequent procedures can usually be lengthened to three to four weeks because after three transfusions fetal erythropoiesis is suppressed and the fetal blood is composed primarily of donor RBCs, which are not at risk for hemolysis. At this point, we assume that the fetal hemoglobin falls by 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL/day</span> and hematocrit falls by an absolute value of 1 percent per day due to aging of RBCs and fetal growth. The lifespan of adult RBCs may be shorter in the fetal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. The rate of fall is variable, however, and faster when the fetus is hydropic (about 2 percent per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]), there is ongoing fetomaternal bleeding, or the mother develops antibodies to new RBC antigens.</p><p>No convincing data supports use of Doppler measurement of fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) for timing repeat transfusions. Although MCA-PSV greater than 1.50 multiples of the median (MoM) is very useful for predicting moderate to severe anemia before the initial fetal transfusion, this threshold performs less well for timing the second and subsequent intrauterine transfusions because fetal MCA blood flow is different when replaced by adult RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/40,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,45</a>]. Adult RBCs are smaller, less rigid, and have different oxygen carrying capacity and oxygen delivery characteristics compared with fetal RBCs. As a result, adult RBCs have different rheological properties than fetal RBCs.</p><p>In a multicenter randomized trial of 71 patients that evaluated serial MCA-PSV determinations versus calculated decline in fetal hematocrit (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/day)</span> for determining inter-transfusion intervals, the number of intrauterine transfusions performed, the incidence of procedure-related complications, and the incidence of adverse infant outcomes was similar for the two approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The serial MCA Doppler group had a nonstatistically signi&#64257;cant trend towards a lower mean hemoglobin level at birth (10.36 versus 12.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and more frequent need for neonatal exchange transfusion (40.0 versus 26.5 percent). This is concerning and implies that the more cost-effective approach for determining when to perform the next intrauterine transfusion should be based on the predicted decline in fetal hematocrit between procedures, which is our practice.</p><p>If a clinician uses MCA-PSV for determining when to perform the second transfusion, we suggest a threshold of 1.69 MoM, which correlates with severe anemia in the fetus who has undergone a single intrauterine transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In one study, a threshold value of 1.69 MoM predicted all cases of severe fetal anemia with a false positive rate of 6 percent and a threshold value of 1.32 MoM predicted all cases of moderate anemia with a false positive rate of 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>We suggest not using MCA-PSV to time IUTs after the second IUT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. After two previous IUTs, 66 to 100 percent of the fetus' RBCs contain adult hemoglobin. In this setting, where most of the fetal RBCs have been replaced by donor cells, MCA-PSV loses its ability to discriminate moderate to severe fetal anemia from mild anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/40,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,48</a>].

Because intraplacental anastomoses are almost universal, we measure MCA-PSV in the twin not targeted for IUT as a baseline.

It can be secondary to arterial spasm; the rate is higher when the umbilical artery is transfused. A case series reported postprocedure bleeding from the puncture site for more than one minute in 5 percent of 135 procedures, but bleeding did not lead to a severe adverse event in six of the seven cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The rates of serious procedure-related complications of intravascular transfusion were illustrated in a series of 937 transfusions in 334 fetuses at the national referral center for fetal therapy in Leiden, The Netherlands between 2001 and 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any complication: 1.2 percent of procedures </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm premature rupture of membranes: 0.1 percent of procedures </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection: 0.1 percent of procedures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency cesarean delivery: 0.4 percent of procedures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal loss: 0.6 percent of procedures</p><p/><p>These rates are lower than or similar to those published in an earlier series from the same center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The authors attributed the improvement to experience derived from a high annual procedure volume and to avoiding techniques that may increase the occurrence of complications, such as arterial puncture, transfusing into a free loop of cord in amniotic fluid, and transfusion without use of fetal paralytic drugs. However, the most recent cohort also had less severe disease at referral (eg, fewer cases of hydrops, fewer transfusions at very early gestational ages).</p><p>The authors noted that pregnancies less than 20 weeks of gestation remain at higher risk of procedure-related complications.

Hydropic fetuses are less likely to survive than fetuses who are not hydropic at first IUT.

The maximum level of bilirubin, rate of intensive phototherapy, and total duration of phototherapy were the same for both groups.

IVT results in significantly higher survival rates than IPT in this population. We also suggest IVT for nonhydropic fetuses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). IVT appears to be more effective in non-hydropic fetuses as well, and its effects are more rapid than IPT, but both procedures are effective and either procedure is reasonable.
