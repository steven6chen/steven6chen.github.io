Some of these noninvasive tests use specialized markers such as alpha 2 macroglobulin (eg, Fibrotest or Fibrosure).</p><p>Fibrotest or Fibrosure also utilizes total bilirubin as one component of its calculation for fibrosis.

The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommends that patients with cirrhosis undergo surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a right upper quadrant ultrasound every 6 to 12 months; As a general rule, surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be cost effective in patients with cirrhosis who have an expected annual incidence of HCC exceeding 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">percent/year</span>. Combined use of serum alfa feto protein and ultrasonography increases detection rates, but also increases cost and false-positive rates.
