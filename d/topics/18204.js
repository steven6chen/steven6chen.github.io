Both non-tunneled, non-cuffed catheters and tunneled, cuffed catheters are available. At present, tunneled, cuffed, double-lumen silastic catheters are the preferred access for short- and intermediate-term use in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These catheters are also used for permanent vascular access in some patients, particularly those with limited alternative options for vascular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>To a significant degree, the transition from non-tunneled catheters to tunneled, cuffed catheters has been driven by a change in preference for arteriovenous (AV) fistulas rather than AV grafts. Because fistulas require a much longer maturation time than grafts, the duration of catheter dependence for vascular access has increased substantially in hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, a catheter is used for the initial dialysis session in approximately 80 percent of incident hemodialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic hemodialysis vascular access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tunneled, cuffed catheters are associated with a number of complications, particularly catheter-related bacteremia. The clinical impact of catheter-related bacteremia in hemodialysis patients has been quantified in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. In the Hemodialysis (HEMO) study, for example, 7.6 percent of all patients had catheters used for vascular access, yet this group comprised 32 percent of all study patients hospitalized with access-related infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In another prospective study of 2666 Scottish patients on renal replacement therapy, use of a tunneled catheter for dialysis access was associated with a 6.9-fold higher odds of death from all causes and infection-related causes compared with patients using only AV fistulas or grafts for dialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Yet, despite these risks and international and national guidelines that recommend fistulas as the preferred form of dialysis access, the proportional use of tunneled catheters for dialysis access has steadily increased in many countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>An overview of tunneled, cuffed dialysis catheter-related bacteremia is presented in this topic review. Other catheter-related complications, such as thrombosis, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombosis associated with chronic hemodialysis vascular catheters&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter-related bacteremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of bacteremias in hemodialysis patients are caused by infection of vascular access catheters. The incidence of bacteremia is greater in patients with indwelling tunneled catheters than in those with either fistulas or synthetic grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. The relative risk of tunneled dialysis catheters causing bacteremia in dialysis patients has been estimated to be approximately 10 times higher than the risk of bacteremia in patients with arteriovenous (AV) fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients have a two- to threefold higher risk of infection-related hospitalization and infection-related death as compared with patients undergoing dialysis via a fistula or graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The frequency of catheter-related bacteremia in several large case series has ranged between 2.5 and 5.5 episodes per 1000 catheter-days, which corresponds to an incidence of 0.9 to 2 episodes of bacteremia per catheter-year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one prospective study involving 108 tunneled catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients, the cumulative likelihood of catheter-related bacteremia was 35 percent within three months and 48 percent within six months of catheter insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A later, larger study that included 472 patients with newly placed tunneled dialysis catheters documented catheter-related bacteremia in 35 percent at three months and 54 percent at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Because of improvements in design, the frequency of catheter-related bacteremia is now relatively less in patients with tunneled versus non-tunneled catheters. The frequency of catheter-related bacteremia was two- to threefold lower in patients with tunneled dialysis catheters in two large, observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastatic infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysis catheter-related bacteremia may also be associated with metastatic complications, such as osteomyelitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, or epidural abscess. Metastatic infections have been observed in approximately 5 to 10 percent of catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The increased frequency of the use of catheters has in turn led to an increasing incidence of such metastatic infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The risk of metastatic infection varies with the type of infecting pathogen. In general, serious metastatic infections occur more frequently in patients with infections due to <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. The reported incidence with <em>S. aureus</em> ranges from 10 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. It is important to note that such metastatic infections may not be immediately obvious, as their onset can sometimes occur weeks, or even months, after the initial bacteremic event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysis catheter-related bacteremia can arise from one of two sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migration from the skin along the outside of the catheter into the bloodstream.

However, rather surprisingly, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has not been associated with a higher risk of catheter-related bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gram-positive organisms are responsible for most dialysis catheter-related infections.

The average length of first hospitalization was 13 days, and 12 percent of these 11,572 patients were readmitted within 12 weeks for treatment of a relapsed infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report, the unadjusted 12-week mortality for dialysis catheter-related <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia was 23 percent among patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia due to a dialysis catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>Methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) infection has also become an important pathogen in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-in-adults-epidemiology#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adults: Epidemiology&quot;, section on 'Hemodialysis'</a>.)</p><p>Non-staphylococcal dialysis catheter-associated bacteremias are due predominantly to enterococci and gram-negative rods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/13,18,24-27,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18,24-27,30,31</a>]. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive dialysis patients are more likely to develop polymicrobial infections and infections due to gram-negative and fungal pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/23,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,32</a>]. Gram-negative organisms accounted for 30 to 40 percent of all episodes of catheter-related bacteremia, and 10 to 20 percent of episodes were polymicrobial in several case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although nonspecific, fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chills are the most sensitive clinical manifestations of catheter-induced bacteremia. In three prospective clinical studies, the presence of fever or chills in catheter-dependent hemodialysis patients was associated with positive blood cultures in approximately 60 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/31,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33,34</a>]. By comparison, purulence at the insertion site or an exit-site infection is more specific but less sensitive. It is important to note that the majority of cases of catheter-associated bacteremia occur in the absence of evidence of an exit-site infection. In a series of 1436 episodes of tunneled dialysis catheter-associated bacteremias, a concurrent purulent exit-site infection was observed in only 4.6 percent of cases, including 9.6 percent of those with a <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> infection, 6.1 percent of those with a <em>S. aureus</em> infection, and &lt;1 percent of these with a gram-negative infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Less common clinical manifestations may include hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, catheter dysfunction, and other symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of sepsis, such as hypothermia, acidosis, and hypotension. Complications related to a bloodstream infection, such as suppurative thrombophlebitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abscess, may also be the first clues to the presence of catheter-related bacteremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter-induced bacteremia should be suspected in any dialysis patient with a hemodialysis catheter and signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of a bloodstream infection, particularly when there is no clinical evidence for an alternate source of infection. Whenever bacteremia is suspected, two blood cultures should be drawn, which can consist of a single peripheral drawn blood sample and a second sample obtained from the dialysis catheter or two samples drawn from separate peripheral sites. However, if blood cannot be obtained from a peripheral vein, two separate samples drawn 10 to 15 minutes apart from the dialysis catheter or dialysis tubing should be obtained before antibiotics are administered.</p><p>Initial evaluation to exclude other possible causes of the presenting symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs is highly variable, and such testing, in large part, depends upon the individual symptoms and the clinical setting. In general, a basic history and physical examination is the starting point; additional laboratory and radiologic evaluation will depend upon the results of this evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive diagnosis of catheter-induced bacteremia requires one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent positive blood cultures of the same organism from the catheter and a peripheral vein, with the colony count or differential time to positivity meeting certain criteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culture of the same organism from both the catheter tip and at least one percutaneous blood culture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cultures of the same organism from two peripherally drawn blood cultures and an absence of an alternate focus of infection.</p><p/><p>Meeting these criteria is relatively straightforward in nondialysis, hospitalized patients. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, these criteria are difficult to satisfy among many hemodialysis patients. This is particularly true in those undergoing maintenance dialysis as outpatients, a setting in which the vast majority of cases of catheter-induced bacteremia are first suspected. The ability to obtain cultures from peripheral blood is particularly difficult in this setting. Thus, among dialysis patients in whom a peripheral blood sample cannot be obtained, catheter-induced bacteremia can be diagnosed if <strong>TWO</strong> cultures drawn at separate times (10 to 15 minutes) from blood tubing are positive with a credible pathogen in a patient with sign and symptoms of bacteremia but without evidence of an alternate source of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic difficulties among dialysis patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limitations with classic diagnostic criteria for catheter-induced bacteremia among dialysis outpatients include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtaining peripheral blood cultures may not be possible in up to 40 percent of dialysis patients, either because their peripheral veins cannot be accessed or because an existing vein needs to be preserved for future fistula or graft creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/13,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,36,37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs occur during a dialysis session, it is unlikely that there is a meaningful difference between samples drawn from peripheral veins and those drawn from catheters or dialysis tubing since systemic blood is circulating through the dialysis system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delays in transporting blood cultures from patients in outpatient dialysis centers to microbiology laboratories are common. This in turn may have a significant effect on the time to detection of bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of catheter-related bacteremia is broad. It includes alternate causes of fever, chills, hemodynamic instability, changes in mental status, catheter dysfunction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacteremia. It is particularly important to consider sources of bacteremia other than the dialysis catheter, including pneumonia, foot infection, and others.</p><p>The causes of such symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs may also vary based upon when they occur. As an example, the causes of hemodynamic instability in a hemodialysis patient may differ if these signs occur during a hemodialysis session than when similar signs are observed outside of such a session. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complications-during-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complications during hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of dialysis catheter-induced bacteremia involves systemic antibiotic therapy and issues surrounding removal of the cuffed dialysis catheter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Empiric systemic antimicrobial therapy should be administered to all dialysis patients suspected of having dialysis catheter-induced bacteremia.

In many dialysis centers in the United States, staphylococcal infections are also frequently methicillin resistant.</p><p>Thus, the empiric treatment of dialysis patients suspected of having a vascular access infection initially involves the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Antibiotics are also routinely selected on the basis of pharmacokinetics properties that permit or facilitate dosing with <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after each dialysis session.</p><p>Among dialysis patients suspected of having a vascular access infection, we suggest the following regimen for empiric systemic antimicrobial therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> is administered for gram-positive coverage until sensitivities become available. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Daptomycin</a> may be substituted for vancomycin for patients who have a documented vancomycin allergy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Broad-spectrum gram-negative coverage can be provided with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a>. The pharmacokinetics properties of both agents are compatible with their administration thrice weekly after each dialysis session. Since the frequency of aminoglycoside ototoxicity may be quite high (up to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], some experts feel that ceftazidime is a better choice than gentamicin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Other experts, however, prefer gentamicin since ceftazidime resistance is observed in some institutions, and less toxic treatment with a nonaminoglycoside can be used when cultures return and better alternatives can be chosen.</p><p/><p>The advantages of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> plus <strong>EITHER</strong> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> include a broad spectrum of coverage for gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and relative ease of administration in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The following are usual doses for patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, in a dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> should be given as a loading dose during the last 60 minutes of the dialysis session, followed by 500 mg in the last 30 to 60 minutes of subsequent dialysis sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Vancomycin may be administered immediately after a dialysis session in inpatients. For high-flux compared with low-flux dialyzers, it is important to adjust the vancomycin dose to reduce the chance of treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The majority of dialysis centers in the United States use high-flux dialyzers. Data suggest that a maintenance dose of 500 mg with each dialysis session is not sufficient to achieve a therapeutic trough vancomycin level in many patients who receive dialysis with high-flux dialyzers. A prospective study of 34 hemodialysis patients found that giving a maintenance dose of 1 g of vancomycin during the last hour of each hemodialysis session resulted in therapeutic vancomycin levels in almost all patients. This study used high-flux dialyzers that remove a lot more vancomycin than the previously used low-flux dialyzers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gentamicin</a>, in a dose of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> should be given after each hemodialysis session. To prevent underdosing and an increased risk of ototoxicity, the dose should be based on ideal body weight rather than actual weight. In addition, some experts do not administer more than 100 mg per dose. Care must be used when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> and gentamicin are used in combination because of the risk of ototoxicity.

In certain settings, such as hemodynamic instability due to bacteremia, immediate catheter removal followed by the placement of a temporary, non-tunneled catheter for short-term dialysis access is recommended. In other clinical circumstances, different clinical options include tunneled catheter exchange over a guidewire or the use of an antibiotic lock in the existing tunneled catheter. Leaving the infected catheter in place without instilling an antibiotic lock or replacing the infected catheter is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended.</p><p>The following sections review some of the data that have evaluated the effectiveness of these approaches. Our specific recommendations concerning the use of these strategies are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediate removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although immediate removal of the infected tunneled, cuffed catheter is generally the best option for achieving cure of the infection, this approach sometimes results in significant subsequent problems in the delivery of dialysis. Nevertheless, severe morbidity and mortality may occur in some patients with certain signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms in whom the infected catheter has not been removed.</p><p>Thus, when the suspicion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diagnosis of tunneled, cuffed dialysis catheter-induced bacteremia is high, we recommend immediately removing the cuffed catheter in the following circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/37,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe sepsis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic instability</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of metastatic infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of accompanying exit-site or tunnel infection, such as pus at the exit-site</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacteremia persist 48 to 72 hours after initiation of antibiotics to which the organism is susceptible</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When infection is due to difficult-to-cure pathogens, such as <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Candida</em>, other fungi, or multiply-resistant bacterial pathogens</p><p/><p>After removal of the tunneled catheter, placement of a temporary, non-tunneled catheter is typically the best alternative option for short-term dialysis access. A new, tunneled dialysis catheter can be inserted once blood cultures with negative results are obtained.</p><p>These issues only apply to tunneled, cuffed dialysis catheters. All non-cuffed dialysis catheters should be immediately removed in the presence of bacteremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Guidewire catheter exchange</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed exchange of the infected cuffed catheter over a guidewire with a new catheter two to three days after institution of effective antimicrobial therapy and resolution of fever is a reasonable option for patients who were initially bacteremic but who lack the above indications for catheter removal or in whom immediate removal of the cuffed catheter is not feasible or practical. This can usually be accomplished before their next dialysis session is due.</p><p>Thus, if the symptoms that prompted initiation of treatment and the bacteremia resolve within 48 to 72 hours after initiation of systemic antibiotics, the infected catheter can be exchanged over a guidewire with a new catheter. However, blood culture results may not be available within this period of time among patients in some outpatient dialysis units if culture bottles are shipped to a commercial laboratory in a distant location rather than processed by a local laboratory.</p><p>In this case, some clinicians may perform catheter exchange over a guidewire in asymptomatic patients prior to confirmation that the bacteremia has resolved. If this is done, we recommend that follow-up blood cultures be obtained after such guidewire-assisted catheter exchanges to verify that the bacteremia has indeed resolved, <strong>EVEN</strong> if the patient remains asymptomatic. If these &quot;surveillance&quot; blood cultures return positive, the tunneled catheter should be removed as cure of infection is unlikely in the face of a documented ongoing bacteremia. As previously mentioned, it is important to realize that bacteremia can be present in patients lacking signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms of an ongoing bloodstream infection.</p><p>Compared with immediate catheter removal, catheter exchange appeared to result in similar cure rates and a decreased rate of required access procedures in some patients in multiple nonrandomized studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/18,22,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22,50-53</a>].

Antibiotic therapy was continued for three weeks. Infection-free catheter survival was observed in more than 90 and 80 percent of patients at 45 and 90 days, respectively. In addition, there was no increase in the frequency of complications. In another study, a high cure rate (75 percent) was observed, even among those with evidence of concurrent exit-site infection, provided that a new subcutaneous tunnel was created at the time of the catheter exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thus, catheter exchange salvage may be effective in highly selected patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/31,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,51</a>].</p><p>As previously mentioned, cuffed catheters should immediately be removed when infection is due to difficult-to-cure pathogens such as <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, <em>Candida</em>, other fungi, or multiply-resistant bacterial pathogens. These issues and the evidence supporting these statements are discussed separately.

All patients in this case series received treatment with antifungal medications for two weeks plus either guidewire catheter exchange or catheter removal with delayed replacement. Recurrence of candidemia (approximately 15 percent) and patient survival were similar in both groups. In addition, none of the patients with guidewire catheter exchange had metastatic infection.</p><p>Nevertheless, unless or until there are more definitive data, we recommend that tunneled catheters be immediately removed in patients with catheter-related candidemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic lock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients without indications for immediate removal of the infected cuffed hemodialysis catheter, the use of an antibiotic lock as adjunctive therapy to systemic antimicrobial administration is an alternative approach to immediate catheter removal with delayed replacement or to guidewire catheter exchange. The goal is to kill the bacteria present in biofilms that frequently adhere to the catheter lumens in hope of achieving successful treatment of the bacteremia while salvaging the tunneled dialysis catheter. It is important to realize that both an antibiotic lock and systemic antimicrobial therapy are administered with this approach.</p><p>Catheter lock solutions typically consist of a mixture of an anticoagulant (heparin or citrate) and high concentrations of an antibiotic in a small volume. This mixture of antibiotic and anticoagulant is then instilled (&quot;locked&quot;) into each catheter lumen at the end of each dialysis session, in place of standard heparin locks, for the duration of the systemic antibiotic therapy (three weeks).

When the systemic antibiotics are switched based upon culture and sensitivity results, the components of the antibiotic lock should also be switched (as listed above). In other words, the antibiotic lock solution is prepared based upon the same antibiotics that are being given systemically. After a therapeutic course of intravenous antibiotics has been completed, antibiotic lock solutions should be discontinued, and standard heparin locks should be resumed.</p><p>Authors of nine prospective, nonrandomized studies (four series with hemodialysis catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/31,33,34,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33,34,55</a>] and five series with other types of tunneled catheters [chemotherapy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/56-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-60</a>]) evaluated the efficacy of the use of antibiotic locks in curing bacteremia without removal of tunneled catheter in &quot;all comers.&quot; Cumulatively, these studies observed a cure in 310 of 405 (76 percent) patients with catheter-related bacteremia.</p><p>The success rate of an antibiotic lock (in conjunction with systemic antibiotics) in curing catheter-related bacteremia is highly dependent on the infecting organism. For example, the success rate was highest (87 to 100 percent) in patients with gram-negative infections, 75 to 84 percent for <em>S. epidermidis</em> infections, and 61 percent for <em>Enterococcus</em> infections, but only 40 to 55 percent in patients with <em>S. aureus</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/19,31,34,58,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,31,34,58,61</a>].</p><p>There have been no well-designed, prospective, comparative studies that have examined the efficacy of antibiotic lock therapy versus guidewire catheter exchange. Further study is needed to reconcile the potential benefits of antibiotic lock therapy (such as preservation of the existing catheter) with the potential risks (such as fungal superinfection). Thus some experts favor the use of guidewire catheter exchange. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, some experts prefer using a trial of systemic and antibiotic lock therapy without immediate catheter removal in dialysis patients with bloodstream infections (particularly in those with limited vascular access):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the fever persists 48 to 72 hours after the initiation of systemic antibiotics and administration of the antibiotic lock solution or bacteremia recurs, the infected catheter should be removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If fever and bacteremia resolve after the initiation of systemic antibiotics and administration of the antibiotic lock solution, the cuffed catheter can be retained.

As mentioned previously, biofilms form rapidly on the inner surface of infected central vein catheters. Although intravenous antibiotics may treat the systemic infection, they cannot eradicate bacteria imbedded in an established biofilm. In other words, intravenous antibiotics alone are insufficient to eradicate most cases of catheter-related bacteremia. Although patients with established biofilms on the surface or the lumens of infected catheters may transiently appear to respond to such intravenous antimicrobial therapy, bacteremia often recurs when such therapy is discontinued. Five large, observational studies found that a clinical cure occurred in only 22 to 37 percent of patients whose catheter-related bacteremia was treated with systemic antibiotics alone (without catheter replacement or antibiotic lock) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/18,26,62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,26,62-64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With nondialysis intravascular catheters, a number of measures can be used to help prevent catheter-related infections. Although most of the approaches apply to dialysis catheters, some cannot be used in the dialysis setting, because of the chronic need for vascular access, anatomic and blood vessel preservation issues, and other concerns.

Our approach to prevention relies upon general measures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis units should develop a written protocol describing in detail the proper use of the aseptic technique when vascular access catheters are manipulated and when dressings are applied after dialysis sessions.

We also recommend that nurses or technicians routinely use hand hygiene and wear nonsterile gloves and a mask when dialysis catheters are accessed. The patient should also wear a mask during hookup and disconnection of the catheter and the dialysis tubing. Hand hygiene is necessary before gloves are donned as glove contamination may occur. Moreover, hand hygiene must also follow removal of gloves as hand contamination routinely occurs when contaminated gloves are removed. In addition, we monitor rates of dialysis-associated infections to detect and understand local trends in types of pathogens, incidence, and antimicrobial resistance in a manner similar to that described by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p>Multiple groups have tried to further decrease the risk of catheter infection in hemodialysis patients by using various other methods.

(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Guidewire catheter exchange'</a> above.)<br/><br/>However, among patients without indications for immediate removal of the cuffed catheter, some experts instill an antibiotic lock solution as adjunctive therapy to systemic antimicrobial treatment, rather than guidewire catheter exchange (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic lock'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If fever, bacteremia, or hemodynamic instability persists 48 to 72 hours after initiation of systemic antibiotics and administration of the antibiotic lock solution, the cuffed catheter should be removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If fever and bacteremia resolve after initiation of systemic antibiotics and administration of the antibiotic lock solution, the cuffed catheter can be retained. The antibiotic lock is given in conjunction with systemic antibiotic therapy for a total of two to three weeks. The antibiotic lock is renewed after every dialysis session. Heparin locks are renewed once the course of systemic antibiotics has been completed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the catheter is removed, patients who remain febrile or have positive cultures should undergo a thorough examination for metastatic complications (such as endocarditis and vertebral osteomyelitis). Clinical signs of metastatic infection may also occur in patients without such signs or symptoms. Thus, all patients with catheter-associated bacteremia should be carefully assessed by serial clinical exams.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although most of the approaches with nondialysis catheters apply to dialysis catheters, some preventive measures cannot be used in the dialysis setting because of the chronic need for vascular access, anatomic and blood vessel preservation issues, and other concerns. Our approach to prevention relies upon general measures.
