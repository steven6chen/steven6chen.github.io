A person with fecal incontinence might leak solid or liquid bowel movements. The term &quot;anal incontinence&quot; includes these issues as well as the leaking of gas.</p><p>Fecal incontinence is most common in women who had 1 or more babies when they were younger. It happens because the muscles that control bowel movements can get damaged in childbirth. Men can also have fecal incontinence for other reasons.</p><p>Having fecal incontinence can be embarrassing and stressful. People who have it sometimes stay at home instead of going out, because they are afraid of having &quot;an accident.&quot; If you have trouble controlling your bowels, you should know that the problem is <strong>not</strong> a normal part of aging. It can often be treated and fixed, or at least improved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12921758\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for fecal incontinence?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will look at your anus and do a &quot;digital rectal exam.&quot; During a digital rectal exam, your doctor or nurse will put a gloved finger into your anus and rectum to feel for lumps or anything abnormal. Doctors can also do a few different tests to find out what might be causing fecal incontinence. Your doctor might order 1 or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy</strong> &ndash; During a colonoscopy, the doctor puts a thin tube into your rectum and advances it up into your colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 1</a>). The tube has a camera attached to it, so the doctor can look inside your colon (also called large intestine) and take tissue samples (called biopsies). A sigmoidoscopy is very similar, but the tube does not go in as far (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58734\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58734 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Manometry</strong> &ndash; Manometry allows the doctor to measure the pressure inside the rectum at various points. It can help the doctor find out if the muscles that control bowel movements are working right. The test also shows whether the person's rectum can feel normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound or MRI</strong> &ndash; Ultrasound and MRI are imaging tests. They can also help the doctor check whether the muscles that control bowel movements are normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bowel movement tests</strong> &ndash; Doctors sometimes check a sample of bowel movement for infections that could cause diarrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12921765\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some people have fewer problems with fecal incontinence if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid foods and drinks that cause loose or frequent bowel movements. Examples include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dairy foods (for people who have trouble with dairy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spicy foods</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fatty or greasy foods</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drinks with caffeine, such as coffee</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diet foods or drinks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sugar-free gum or candy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Alcohol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat smaller meals, more often. In some people, eating a large meal triggers the urge to have a bowel movement. It can also cause diarrhea. Eating smaller and more frequent meals can reduce the number of bowel movements you have.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat more fiber. Fiber makes bowel movements bulkier and sturdier. This can make bowel movements easier to control. Foods that have a lot of fiber include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52349 \">table 1</a>). You can also get more fiber by taking fiber supplements, such as Metamucil, Citrucel, or Benefiber.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12921772\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have fecal incontinence, tell your doctor or nurse. People are sometimes too shy to bring it up. But fecal incontinence is a real medical problem that can be treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12921779\"><span class=\"h1\">How is fecal incontinence treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments your doctor might suggest include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fiber pills, powders, or wafers</strong> &ndash; Fiber supplements make bowel movements bulkier and sturdier. This can make bowel movements easier to control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines to reduce the number of bowel movements</strong> &ndash; These medicines are often used to treat diarrhea. They can decrease the number of &quot;accidents&quot; a person has. Examples of these medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">loperamide</a> (sample brand name: Imodium) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenoxylate-and-atropine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">diphenoxylate-atropine</a> (brand name: Lomotil).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines to slow the movement of food through the intestines</strong> &ndash; These medicines are called &quot;anti-cholinergics.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment to empty the bowels</strong> &ndash; Some people with fecal incontinence have bowels that are full and that they cannot empty completely. These people need treatment to flush the bowels. Then, once the bowels are cleaned out, they can take medicines to keep bowel movements regular.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scheduled bathroom visits</strong> &ndash; Some people have fewer accidents if they visit the bathroom on a schedule. They try to go even when they don't &quot;feel&quot; like they need to go.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biofeedback</strong> &ndash; Biofeedback is a way to retrain the muscles that control bowel movements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56581\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56581 \">figure 3</a>). It is done at the doctor's office and involves using devices called sensors that measure muscle activity. These sensors tell you if you are using the muscles the right way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrical nerve stimulation</strong> &ndash; Doctors can implant devices that send a mild electrical current to the nerves that control the muscles in the anus. These devices sometimes help improve bowel control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; Doctors can sometimes do surgery to repair the muscles that control bowel movements. This is often helpful in women whose muscles were damaged during childbirth. There are also other types of surgery to treat fecal incontinence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12921786\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fecal incontinence (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
