Of the pathogenic <em>Klebsiella</em> species, <em>K. pneumoniae</em> is the most prevalent and clinically important. Infections with <em>K. pneumoniae</em> are usually hospital-acquired and occur primarily in patients with impaired host defenses.</p><p>An important exception to these general observations is a community-acquired invasive primary liver abscess syndrome, which can occur in patients without any underlying predisposing medical conditions and has primarily been described in countries in East Asia, particularly Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive liver abscess syndrome caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of infections due to <em>K. pneumoniae</em> will be reviewed here. The microbiology and pathogenesis of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and pathogenesis of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are the primary reservoir for <em>K. pneumoniae</em>. Carrier rates of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> in the community range from 5 to 38 percent in stool samples and 1 to 6 percent in the nasopharynx; <em>Klebsiella</em> species are rarely carried on the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Higher rates of nasopharyngeal carriage have been noted in ambulatory alcoholic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Chinese ethnicity itself might be a major risk factor for intestinal colonization; stool carrier rates of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> in healthy Chinese adults ranged from 19 percent in Japan to 88 percent in Malaysia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Carrier rates are markedly increased in hospitalized patients, among whom reported rates are 77 percent in the stool, 19 percent in the pharynx, and 42 percent on the hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The higher rates of colonization are primarily related to the use of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>]. This increase in prevalence is important clinically since, in one report, <em>Klebsiella</em> nosocomial infection was four times higher in stool carriers compared with noncarriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, in a study of 855 patients with <em>K. pneumoniae</em> liver abscess in Taiwan and 3420 age- and sex-matched controls, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> use within the prior 30 days of diagnosis (but not the prior 31 to 90 days) was associated with an increased risk of liver abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p><em>K. pneumoniae</em> can also be found in soil and water, and organisms from coastal water can be a zoonotic pathogen of marine mammals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. As an example, in Taiwan, a liver abscess caused by <em>K. pneumoniae</em> was identified in a red-footed tortoise, and the isolate was genetically related to abscess-forming pathogens in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>There may be seasonal variation in the occurrence of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> infections, as illustrated by a study that found a higher incidence of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> bloodstream infections during the warmer months across four continents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In a series of 101 patients with <em>Klebsiella</em> bacteremia, for example, underlying diabetes was present in 36 percent and malignancy in 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the relative importance of diabetes and malignancy as risk factors varies with site of acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Rare cases have raised the possibility of certain occupational exposures as risk factors for infection, as illustrated by a report of food handlers who developed <em>K. pneumoniae</em> central nervous system infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of acquisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections caused by <em>K. pneumoniae</em> can be acquired in the hospital setting, in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes (called non-nosocomial healthcare-associated infections), and, less often, in the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/2,6,15,17,20-22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,15,17,20-22,26</a>].</p><p>It has been estimated that <em>Klebsiella</em> species account for 3 to 8 percent of all nosocomial bacterial infections, with the most common manifestations being urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and primary bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. The major risk factors for such infections are prior antibiotic use and use of invasive plastic devices, such as bladder catheters, endotracheal tubes, and intravenous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/2,6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,21</a>]. Widespread antibiotic use is also responsible for the development of multidrug resistance in <em>K. pneumoniae</em>. (See <a href=\"#H6012683\" class=\"local\">'Resistant organisms'</a> below.)</p><p>The predisposing diseases and site of infection appear to vary with the site of acquisition. This was illustrated in a prospective study from Taiwan of 158 consecutively hospitalized patients with <em>K. pneumoniae</em> bacteremia seen between 1997 and 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying diabetes was significantly more common with community-acquired infection (49 versus 13 percent), whereas malignancy was significantly more common with nosocomial infection (53 versus 14 percent). Among community-acquired infections, diabetes is a particular risk factor for primary liver abscess. (See <a href=\"#H6013591\" class=\"local\">'Liver abscess'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive liver abscess syndrome caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All cases of liver abscess were community acquired, and liver abscess was identified in 23 percent of community-acquired infections. An inability to identify a primary source of infection was significantly more common with nosocomial bacteremia (58 versus 16 percent of community-acquired bacteremias).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although nosocomial <em>K. pneumoniae</em> infections occur worldwide, some types of community-acquired infection are seen in only a few areas. As an example, regional differences in the primary source of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> bacteremia were evaluated in a review of 455 consecutive cases in seven countries (Taiwan, South Africa, United States, Australia, Belgium, Turkey, and Argentina) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Community-acquired pneumonia was seen only in Taiwan and South Africa and the invasive community-acquired syndrome of liver abscess, meningitis, or endophthalmitis was only seen in Taiwan. However, sporadic cases of primary <em>K. pneumoniae</em> liver abscess are now being reported worldwide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-liver-abscess-syndrome-caused-by-klebsiella-pneumoniae#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive liver abscess syndrome caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Virulence factors in the <em>K. pneumoniae</em> isolates appeared to play a significant role in the geographic restriction of these syndromes. The isolates from Taiwan and South Africa compared with the other countries were much more likely to have a mucoid phenotype (100 versus 2 percent) and to be rmpA-positive (86 versus 7 percent). Other virulence factors, such as K1 capsular serotype, were common in Taiwan and South Africa but rarely seen in the other countries. Furthermore, in other studies from Taiwan, an increased number of virulence factors have been particularly associated with community-acquired primary liver abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/1,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29</a>].

As an example, a report of 241 patients with <em>Klebsiella</em> bacteremia from Israel found significantly higher rates of both shock and mortality with nosocomial infections (65 and 42 versus 37 and 22 percent in community-acquired infections) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>K. pneumoniae</em> is primarily a nosocomial pathogen that has been associated with urinary tract infection, pulmonary infection, bacteremia, and other infections in susceptible individuals who have the risk factors described above.

This was illustrated in a review of 4543 patients with pneumonia in United States hospitals between January 2002 and December 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. <em>K. pneumoniae</em> accounted for 8.4 percent of cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), 7.1 percent of cases of non-ventilated hospital-acquired pneumonia (defined as first positive culture more than two days after admission), and 7.6 percent of cases of healthcare-associated pneumonia (eg, infections occurring in long-term care facilities, also called non-nosocomial healthcare-associated pneumonia). In other series, <em>K. pneumoniae</em> accounted for 2 to 3.3 percent of cases of VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>] and 4.8 percent of cases of non-ventilated hospital-acquired pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Nosocomial colonization of the upper respiratory tract is common in hospitalized patients, particularly in patients who require ventilator support or admission to an intensive care unit. Thus, isolation of <em>Klebsiella</em> from the sputum of a hospitalized patient without other signs and symptoms of pneumonia may not be indicative of an infection.

In a series of 198 cases of acute <em>K. pneumoniae</em> pneumonia, the majority of which were nosocomial, the most common CT findings were ground glass opacities (100 percent), alveolar consolidation (91 percent), intralobar reticular opacities (86 percent), and pleural effusions (53 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>On Gram stain of the sputum, short, plump, gram-negative bacilli that are usually surrounded by a capsule that appears as a clear space can be seen in nosocomial <em>K. pneumoniae</em> pneumonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70346\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70346 \">picture 1</a>). However, this finding is not specific, as other organisms may also appear this way. Other pathogens, specifically <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> or <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, may be found in addition to <em>K. pneumoniae</em> in the sputum from nosocomial cases more frequently than community-acquired cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Additionally, <em>Klebsiella</em> isolates in nosocomial cases are more likely to be multidrug-resistant.

In a review of 262 patients with CAP in the Netherlands, a presumptive diagnosis of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> was made in only one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Similarly, in a global review of 202 episodes of community-acquired <em>K. pneumoniae</em> bacteremia, only four cases of bacteremic pneumonia were noted in the United States, Europe, Argentina, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. On the other hand, 53 cases were noted in South Africa and Taiwan.</p><p>In contrast to its low prevalence as a cause of CAP overall, <em>K. pneumoniae</em> constitutes a higher proportion of isolates in more severe infections. In a study from Taiwan, <em>K. pneumoniae</em> was the most common bacteria isolated from 59 patients with CAP requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Additionally, in three separate series, the proportion of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> isolates was 9.5 percent in patients with CAP requiring admission, 11 percent in patients presenting with septic shock, and 22 percent in patients with severe CAP (one-half with shock) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/31,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,39,40</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> pneumonia are similar to those of other causes of bacterial pneumonia (eg, cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, sputum production, crackles on physical examination, and leukocytosis). However, <em>K. pneumoniae</em> pneumonia is also associated with marked inflammation and necrosis that can lead to thick, mucoid and blood-tinged sputum, referred to as &quot;currant jelly&quot; sputum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to the radiographic findings in nosocomial cases, community-acquired K. pneumoniae often produces a lobar pneumonia that is similar radiologically to that due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/34,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,41</a>].

Gram-negative bacilli, and <em>K. pneumoniae</em> specifically, accounted for 36 and 25 percent of isolates, respectively; other organisms included anaerobes (34 percent), gram-positive cocci (26 percent), and gram-positive bacilli (4 percent). This is in contrast to a study from Japan of patients with community-acquired lung abscess from 1994 to 2008, among whom <em>K. pneumoniae</em> was an identified pathogen in only 8 percent of 122 patients with documented etiologic pathogens (5.3 percent of total isolates) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>An accompanying editorial noted that the study from Taiwan might have been biased since 25 percent of the patients had received antibiotics prior to culture, making recovery of anaerobes less likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-klebsiella-pneumoniae-infection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In addition, there may have been selection bias in terms of when transthoracic aspiration was performed, since only 90 of 336 cases of lung abscess (27 percent) had evaluable microbiologic studies.
