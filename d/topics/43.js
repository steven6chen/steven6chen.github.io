AUB refers to bleeding that is excessive or occurs outside of normal cyclic menstruation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. AUB is described by a variety of terms and may be caused by a number of genital and nongenital tract diseases, systemic disorders, and medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62751\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62751 \">table 1</a>).

The management of AUB in adolescents who have chronic disease, have underlying coagulation disorders, or are undergoing chemotherapy or solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is beyond the scope of this topic review. Such patients should be managed in conjunction with the appropriate subspecialist. As an example, (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heavy-or-irregular-uterine-bleeding-during-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heavy or irregular uterine bleeding during chemotherapy&quot;</a>).</p><p>The normal menstrual cycle, the evaluation of AUB in adolescents, and the evaluation and management of causes of AUB other than anovulatory uterine bleeding in premenopausal women are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-evaluation-and-approach-to-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Evaluation and approach to diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of abnormal uterine bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519044637\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AUB refers to bleeding that is excessive or occurs outside of normal cyclic menstruation in the absence of hormonal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is the most common cause of anovulatory uterine bleeding in adolescents and is expected for the first one to two years after menarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

However, in a systematic review of randomized trials in adult women with AUB presumed to be secondary to endometrial dysfunction, a variety of combined estrogen-progestin contraceptive regimens appeared to be equally effective (with 35 to 65 percent reductions in menstrual blood loss) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-management/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For girls who are <strong>actively bleeding</strong>, we use the following regimen (the pills that do not contain hormones should be discarded):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One pill every eight hours until the bleeding stops (usually within 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]), then</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One pill every 12 hours for 2 days, then</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One pill once per day for a total of at least 21 days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternative tapering regimens are described in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-adolescents-management/abstract/3,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Close follow-up (in person or by phone) is essential while the pills are being taken two or three times per day.

Anovulatory uterine bleeding refers to noncyclic menstrual blood flow that results from anovulatory production of sex steroids. Immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is the most common cause of anovulatory uterine bleeding in adolescents. (See <a href=\"#H519044637\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of management of AUB include return to a pattern of normal menstrual cycles and prevention of short- and long-term sequelae (eg, anemia, hemodynamic instability, infertility endometrial cancer). (See <a href=\"#H590028464\" class=\"local\">'Goals of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to exclude pregnancy and pelvic infection before initiating treatment of anovulatory uterine bleeding. Other causes of AUB and anovulatory uterine bleeding should be evaluated as indicated based upon clinical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62751\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62751 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H519044609\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents who are being treated for anovulatory uterine bleeding should maintain a menstrual calendar (paper (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76376\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76376 \">figure 2</a>) or mobile &quot;app&quot; version) to monitor response to therapy and subsequent episodes of anovulatory uterine bleeding. Patients with anovulatory uterine bleeding are at risk for iron deficiency anemia and should be monitored and treated as indicated. (See <a href=\"#H680809514\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring response'</a> above and <a href=\"#H519044623\" class=\"local\">'Management of iron deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acute management of anovulatory uterine bleeding depends upon severity, whether the patient is actively bleeding, the preferences of the patient and guardian, and the need for contraception:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild anovulatory uterine bleeding is characterized by longer-than-normal menses or shortened cycles for more than two months; hemoglobin is usually normal (&ge;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> but may be mildly decreased (10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Acute management of mild anovulatory uterine bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For girls with mild anovulatory uterine bleeding, normal hemoglobin (&gt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> and no desire for contraception who report that their quality of life is not affected by the bleeding, we suggest observation and reassurance rather than hormonal therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For girls with mild anovulatory uterine bleeding and hemoglobin between 10 and 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> we suggest either observation and reassurance or hormonal therapy to stabilize endometrial proliferation and promote cyclic shedding (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate anovulatory uterine bleeding is characterized by moderately prolonged or frequent menses every one to three weeks and hemoglobin &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Moderate anovulatory uterine bleeding usually can be managed in the outpatient setting. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute management of moderate anovulatory uterine bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For girls with moderate anovulatory uterine bleeding who are not actively bleeding, we suggest either progestin-only hormone therapy or combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Currently bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For girls with moderate anovulatory uterine bleeding who are actively bleeding, we suggest combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives rather than progestin-only therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Tranexamic acid</a> may be an alternative for those who prefer to avoid hormonal therapy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Currently bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe anovulatory uterine bleeding is defined by disruptive menstrual cycles with heavy bleeding that causes a decrease in hemoglobin (to &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and may or may not cause hemodynamic instability. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Acute management of severe anovulatory uterine bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Indications for hospitalization in girls with severe anovulatory uterine bleeding include hemodynamic instability, hemoglobin concentration &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> with active heavy bleeding, symptomatic anemia, and need for intravenous conjugated estrogen (eg, cannot take oral medications or continued bleeding after 24 hours of estrogen-progestin combination therapy). Girls who require hospitalization for management of anovulatory uterine bleeding should undergo evaluation for a bleeding disorder. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Indications for hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>We suggest hormonal therapy as the initial intervention for girls with severe anovulatory uterine bleeding, whether they are hospitalized or treated as outpatients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Combination oral contraceptive pills are the first-line hormonal therapy for the acute management of severe anovulatory uterine bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H422648292\" class=\"local\">'Combination therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term follow-up is essential. Hormonal treatment should be continued for at least three to six months when possible. Hormonal therapy that has been discontinued can be restarted if heavy menstrual bleeding recurs. Alternatively, girls who go more than three months without a period (and are not pregnant) should undergo an endocrinology workup and receive a course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> to induce withdrawal bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Long-term management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536845668\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Dr. Robert Zurawin, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">APGO educational series on women's health issues.
