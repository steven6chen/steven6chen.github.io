These toddlers have been described as &ldquo;behaviorally inhibited&rdquo;, which is believed to be a fairly stable temperament with physiological correlates, such as increased salivary cortisol levels and muscle tension, greater pupil dilation, and elevated urinary catecholamine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Toddlers identified as behaviorally inhibited are at greater risk for developing clinical anxiety disorders in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. A study of 91 children showed that social anxiety disorder, but not other anxiety disorders, in adolescence was predicted by behavioral inhibition at preschool age. Nearly 37 percent of behaviorally inhibited preschool age children had social anxiety disorder at age 15, compared with 15 percent of nonbehaviorally inhibited children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Individuals with anxiety disorders have difficulty distinguishing between contexts and cues that signal safety and those that represent threat (conditioning). It is also difficult for them to learn to ignore these associations when they are no longer applicable (extinction). </p><p>Research suggests that individuals with anxiety disorders have an attention bias toward threat-related stimuli, as well as cognitive distortions consistent with their anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This bias includes hypervigilance for potentially threatening stimuli, over-interpretation of neutral stimuli as potentially threatening, and increased attention toward potentially threatening stimuli. Error-related negativity may be another cognitive marker of anxiety in youth. A review of 22 studies of error-related negativity in youth found that error-related negativity is enhanced in clinical anxious youth across development (ages 6 to 18), and that error-related negativity can predict the development of anxiety across different developmental periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Anxious cognitive patterns can present early in development, as demonstrated by a study of 135 adolescents with social phobia reporting more negative and threat-bias thoughts than their peers without social anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Threat bias in cognitive processing of information may represent one of the strongest, most consistently demonstrated correlates of individual differences in anxiety. A study comparing cognitive processes in 60 youth (ages 8 to 12 years) with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), or no anxiety disorder found no differences between youth with GAD or SAD in worry, intolerance of uncertainty, negative beliefs about worry, or negative problem orientation; however, both groups scored higher in these domains than youth with no anxiety disorder. The GAD group also scored higher than the no anxiety group on cognitive avoidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59901728\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurobiological factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal and human studies have found the cortico-amygdala circuitry to have an important role in fear learning. Amygdala engagement has been demonstrated immediately following the pairing of an aversive unconditioned stimulus with a conditioned stimulus, and the later presentation of the conditioned stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

A small study of 14 anxious adolescents and 19 healthy adolescents found that sleep amount differentially impacted the fear processing neural circuitry in response to negatively valenced faces between these two groups. The study found a positive correlation between sleep amount with blood-oxygen-level dependent activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus in anxiety adolescents, and a negative correlation in the healthy adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>An imbalance in the amygdala-vPFC network, specifically elevated amygdala activity and decreased vmPFC activity, may be a neurobiological hallmark of anxiety disorders in that it is correlated with impaired extinction learning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Studies have suggested that adolescence is a period of maximum imbalance between these two brain regions developmentally; this may be related to the emergence of functionally impairing anxiety disorders during the pubertal years. The role of reward circuitry in the development <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintenance of anxiety in adolescence is also an area of emerging investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Studies combining neuroimaging and genomics have suggested linkages between functional gene variants and brain information processing.

Twin studies have demonstrated significant familial aggregation among GAD, panic disorder, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Most estimates of anxiety trait heritability in children are around 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], though as high as 50 to 60 percent in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These findings suggest that genetic factors play a large role in the development of these disorders relative to environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A meta-analysis of 13 cohorts (42,585 subjects) with social anxiety showed that genetic and nonshared environmental factors explain most of the variance for social anxiety disorder and social anxiety symptoms across age groups. Adult cohorts showed a higher contribution of nonshared environment and half the genetic contribution compared with younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Some research suggests that the contribution of genetics to the development of anxiety disorders may change over the course of an individual&rsquo;s development. Supporting a dynamic contribution of genetics, a study of 2508 twins suggested an effect of some genes that are &ldquo;turned on&rdquo; in adolescence and others that are diminished throughout development. The overall variance accounted for by genetic contributions decreased from 72 percent at ages 8 and 9 to 12 percent at ages 19 and 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>It is unlikely that a single gene associated with one specific pathophysiological function is responsible for anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Family and genetic studies suggest some people may have a genetic vulnerability to develop anxiety disorders generally. Genome Wide Association Studies have begun to look for specific candidate genes associated with anxiety disorders; however, these studies result in a large number of candidate genes with relatively small odds ratios or lack of statistical significance in <span class=\"nowrap\">genotype/phenotype</span> associations, possibly due to the cumulative effect of many genes on the vulnerability for anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/43,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,48,49</a>]. Genetic findings associated with anxiety disorders or anxiety-like behavior include a gene that promotes a corticotropin releasing hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59901735\"><span class=\"h2\">Social and environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental and social factors play an important role in shaping anxiety-driven behavior. This can include specific and non-specific influences. At the core of anxiety is often a nonspecific, marked sense of uncontrollability when individuals are faced with certain tasks or challenges that may be in some way threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Individuals with a subclinical level of anxiety seem to manifest an &ldquo;illusion of control,&rdquo; in which response deficiencies are attributed to passing external causes or trivial, temporary internal states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Several animal studies suggest that the predictability and controllability of important events, such as the acquisition of food and escape from pain, play a central role in the development of anxiety and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. Specific environmental influences also play a role in the development of anxiety disorders, and may help to shape the specific worries or feared stimuli and situations. As an example, a child&rsquo;s scary encounter with a dog may result in an ongoing phobia of dogs. Data from a study of 385 monozygotic and 486 dizygotic same-sex twin families assessed the children of twins and found evidence of a significant direct environmental transmission of anxiety from parent to child using structural equation modeling. There was no evidence of direct genetic transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Parenting styles appear to be critical environmental factors in the development of children&rsquo;s anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Anxious, overprotective, or overly critical parenting behaviors can contribute to the development of pathological anxiety in children. When parents are insensitive to their child&rsquo;s expressive, exploratory, and independent behaviors, the child is at risk of developing inhibition and a sense of uncontrollability over his or her world, which may contribute to anxiety. Overprotective parenting styles that focus too strongly on reinforcing the dangers of the outside world can lead to the development of anxiety in children. Anxious, overprotective parents are less likely to encourage and support their child&rsquo;s brave and exploratory behaviors, thus potentially reinforcing or maintaining anxious and avoidance behavior. A prospective, longitudinal study of 1015 adolescents (aged 14 to 17 at baseline) and their mothers, assessed annually for 10 years, demonstrated that low individual autonomy of the child in the mother-child relationship increased the risk for anxiety disorders in the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Children learn specific, important psychological information from observation and experience. Parents&rsquo; modeling of anxious behaviors can result in similar anxious behaviors in kids. As an example, in a study of 129 youth and their parents, children responded with more anxiety to scripts in which their parents acted anxious than to scripts in which their parent acted confident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Parents&rsquo; ability to regulate their own emotional reactivity, particularly reactions to their child&rsquo;s experience of fear, was found to be a link between parent and child anxiety, such that in a study of 75 school-age children and their parents, only when parents reported high reactivity to their child&rsquo;s fear was there a significant association between parent anxiety and children&rsquo;s self-reported and physiologic reactivity. Children&rsquo;s physiologic reactivity served as an indirect effect in the link between parents&rsquo; and child&rsquo;s anxiety symptoms, only for parents who reported high level of reactivity to child fear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Another study asked 45 mothers of youth ages three to eight to listen to a recording of a distressed, anxious child pleading for help from a parent. The study found that higher maternal negative affect and using multiple emotion regulation strategies in a short time during the recording were associated with higher reports of child anxiety. Sequential modeling showed that maternal anxiety predicted ineffective maternal emotion regulation during the recording, which in turn predicted greater maternal accommodation, which predicted higher child anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p>Child maltreatment, such as abusive or neglectful parenting behaviors, have been found to be linked to anxiety disorders, particularly to social anxiety disorder in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] and adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. </p><p>Children learn anxious and fearful responding from their environment in at least three ways: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct negative experiences &ndash; eg, being bitten by a dog leads to a fear of dogs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False alarms &ndash; eg, perceiving a situation negatively, such as school performance, without direct evidence supporting this belief</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vicariously &ndash; eg, witnessing or being told something is dangerous</p><p/><p>Children who observe their parent modeling fearful responses to a stimulus (eg, spiders) are more likely to respond in a similar way. Children also learn to cope with anxiety through avoidance after observing that parental anxiety is reduced by their own avoidant behaviors, or by experiencing a decrease in their own discomfort as a result of avoidance (ie, negative reinforcement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3637082\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children can present with a variety of symptoms or behaviors that may signify an anxiety disorder. They, their parents, or teachers may report:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance &ndash; Academic and social activities may be avoided, such as school, parties, camp, sleepovers, or talking to safe strangers. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somatic symptoms &ndash; As examples, headaches, stomach aches, or dramatic presentations of pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep problems &ndash; Difficulty falling asleep or waking up in the middle of the night</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive need for reassurance &ndash; The child may seek excessive or repetitive reassurance prompted by bedtime, storms, school time, or more generally related to fears of bad things happening. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor school performance &ndash; As examples, demonstrating inattention in class or having difficulty completing tests within the allotted time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explosiveness and oppositional behavior &ndash; Such outbursts may be triggered by an anxiety-provoking stimulus, for example, at home or school.

Research suggests a significant proportion of children, children with selective eating or weight concerns, report anxious behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suicidal thoughts or behavior &ndash; Many studies suggest anxious youth may report suicidal thoughts or behavior in the absence of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>]. These studies suggest that between 22 and 58 percent of anxious youth report suicidal ideation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>]. Other studies have found that suicidal ideation or behavior in anxious youth is association with hopelessness and comorbid depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. A study of 100 youth (ages 7 to 13) receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety found that 24 percent of the sample endorsed suicidal thoughts or behavior at the baseline assessment, and 13 percent reported suicidal ideation during treatment. Depressive symptoms significantly predicted suicidal thoughts and behaviors in this sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p/><p>Anxiety symptoms may be pervasive, but they may alternatively occur in some settings and situations and not others. Individual anxiety disorders can be distinguished by the nature of the stimuli that trigger anxiety, the cognitions experienced, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the resulting behaviors, as described below:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343722552\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized anxiety disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A child presenting with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) will typically present with a host of worries that he or she finds difficult to stop or control. Many children with GAD discuss preoccupation with academic performance. The preoccupations often manifest in perfectionism and an &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; cognitive bias, wherein they perceive that they must perform perfectly or they are no good. These children and adolescents tend to focus on mistakes they have made, rather than successes. Other children with GAD discuss a number of personal safety or health concerns, relating to themselves and their loved ones. They may have difficulty sleeping due to worry about someone breaking into their home, or report a preoccupation with contracting a feared disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343722559\"><span class=\"h2\">Social anxiety disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Social anxiety disorder is often observable on presentation because the child may be shy or withdrawn during the assessment interview, exhibiting poor eye contact or providing limited answers to questions until they have had time to warm up. Children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder will often describe a fear of saying or doing the wrong thing, being laughed at, or being embarrassed, resulting in avoidance of social and performance situations. Their worries focus more on what others think of them, rather than on their own perceptions of their performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343722566\"><span class=\"h2\">Panic disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Youth with panic disorder will describe experiencing panic attacks as the primary presenting problem, and a fear of having another attack which is contributing to distress, avoidance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impairment. The cognitions they describe often focus on the uncomfortable physical symptoms and fears of what these symptoms might signify (eg, &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m having a heart attack; I feel like I&rsquo;m going crazy; I worry that I will lose control and something bad will happen&rdquo;). Often the sense of uncontrollability revolves around not knowing when an attack may occur. Youth will often report avoiding a variety of different settings or situations for fear of triggering a panic attack.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2356682374\"><span class=\"h2\">Agoraphobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agoraphobia is marked by pronounced fear in particular environments or situations, such as large open spaces (parking lots, bridges), crowded places (shopping malls, theater, ballpark), small enclosed areas (elevator), public transportation (planes, trains, cars), or generally being outside of the home, especially alone. The focus of the fear, and subsequent avoidance, of these places or situations is related to thoughts of being unable to escape or cope with physical symptoms (such a panic) or other debilitating or potentially humiliating symptoms. Youth with agoraphobia will avoid developmentally important situations, such as school or common social experiences due to this fear, or will require the presence of a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; person, such as a parent or close friend, in order to participate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343722573\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific phobias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adolescents will often describe a number of different phobias, particularly when asked. Only some that they describe result in functional impairment. As an example, a child who is fearful of dogs may report a wish to avoid the park or the home of friends with dogs, which becomes socially interfering. Parents may describe that the child runs to the other side of the road when a dog is approaching, which presents a safety concern. Many children display some anxiety during thunderstorms, but a child with a specific phobia of storms may describe a marked preoccupation with the weather and avoid going outside when it is raining. In contrast to adult diagnostic criteria, it is not necessary for children to judge their fear or phobia as excessive or unreasonable in order to diagnose a specific phobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343722580\"><span class=\"h2\">Separation anxiety disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Separation anxiety disorder is often observable when the child presents for an initial assessment. The child may have trouble separating from their parent in order to participate in their portion of the interview. Parents may also display anxiety about being separated from their child. When separated, the child may frequently wish to check in with the parent, or vice-versa, increasing the time needed to complete the assessment. The child will typically report worries about something bad happening when they are separated from their parents. Parents will often describe difficulty getting the child to sleep on their own. Families may report that the child often sleeps with their parents or requires a parent to lay down with him or her in order to fall asleep. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343722605\"><span class=\"h2\">Selective mutism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of selective mutism is readily observable if the child refuses or is reluctant to speak in the assessment setting. Parents report that the child readily talks at home, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> around select family or friends, but does not speak in school or other settings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539111586\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research studies suggest a developmental progression of anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective mutism typically develops prior to age five, with age of onset ranging from two to four years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age of onset for separation anxiety and specific phobias is approximately seven years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School refusal has a bimodal age of onset between the ages of five to six and ten to eleven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized anxiety disorder typically presents in school age years, with an typical age of onset around seven years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social anxiety disorder is most common in early adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panic disorder has a typical age of onset in later adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p/><p>Early onset anxiety disorders are often chronic when left untreated, although the nature of the symptoms may change across child and adolescent development.

In a cross-sectional study of 488 youth with social anxiety disorder, child and parent reports of impairment in social, academic, and general functioning increased with child age, even when controlling for severity of social anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>], potentially suggesting that as a child ages their avoidance may increase and parental support or involvement may decrease, leading to greater impairment in day-to-day life. </p><p>The course of anxiety symptoms severity may follow a steady, increasing, decreasing, or fluctuating course throughout child and adolescent development. As an example, in a longitudinal study of 242 participants (mean age 13.52) of a baseline sample of 1514 participants (mean age 10.23) who were followed up over three years, 56 percent of participants showed elevated scores on the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders at one-year follow-up and 32 percent of respondents had elevated Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders scores at three-year follow-up. Eight percent showed fluctuating symptom course, and 55 percent of participants showed high scores for any anxiety subtype over three years, with generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder being the most prevalent and persistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Gender may play a role in the course of anxiety disorder symptoms. For example, a latent growth curve modeling study of 1000 youth (57 percent female) assessed annually over two years found a slight linear decrease in generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder symptoms for females, while males demonstrated a stable course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>A history of an anxiety disorder in <span class=\"nowrap\">adolescence/childhood</span> confers an approximate two- to threefold increased risk of having an anxiety disorder or depressive disorder in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Further longitudinal studies are needed to clearly explicate the implications of specific childhood anxiety disorders on adult anxiety disorders; however, evidence suggest that the presence of an anxiety disorder in childhood, and particularly in adolescence, is a strong predictor of an anxiety disorder diagnosis in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anxiety-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-course/abstract/80,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,88</a>]. As an example, a recent meta-analysis found five studies that suggested that a childhood diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder increases the risk for future anxiety later in life.
