In this setting, the goal is to maintain virologic suppression, while improving the patient's quality of life and reducing the risk of short- or long-term toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This is distinct from the situation of virologic failure, in which a salvage regimen must be crafted because of poor adherence and virologic rebound, with or without drug resistance. </p><p>This topic will describe the approach to making a regimen switch in the setting of virologic suppression. Topic reviews that discuss changing a regimen in the setting of virologic failure are presented elsewhere.

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pill burden</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New or worsening medical comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-drug interactions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of an older regimen with a higher risk of long-term toxicity</p><p/><p>Other reasons might include cost issues or changes in insurance, desire to match a partner's regimen, difficulty with food requirements, or pregnancy. In a study of 246 patients who changed ART between January 2011 and July 2012, the most common reasons were toxicity and regimen simplification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3726310809\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION PRIOR TO SWITCHING REGIMENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When switching a regimen, the goal is to maintain a suppressed plasma viral load (HIV RNA) while improving the patient's quality of life and reducing the risk of short- or long-term toxicity. To determine if this is feasible, it is important to evaluate the patient's antiretroviral history (especially history of any virologic failures, antiretroviral drug resistance, or antiretroviral drug intolerances), comorbid conditions, and barriers to taking the current regimen. Every discussion about switching antiretroviral therapy (ART) should include an explanation of the potential risks and benefits, as well as a discussion of the potential to resume the pre-switch regimen if unanticipated side effects occur. (See <a href=\"#H4255053366\" class=\"local\">'Ensuring the potency of the new regimen'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4047536679\" class=\"local\">'Other considerations for regimen selection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H83888990\" class=\"local\">'Can a patient resume a prior regimen'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3514403398\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiretroviral history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the biggest concerns when switching a regimen is the risk of virologic failure with the new regimen. To assess this risk, it is important to obtain the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the patient has a history of documented antiretroviral drug resistance mutations (either pretreatment or in the setting of past virologic failure). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of HIV drug resistance testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the patient experienced past virologic failure that raises concern for drug resistance, even if no resistance-associated mutations were documented. </p><p/><p>A common clinical challenge arises when past resistance results are not available or were performed when the patient was not taking <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> ART regimen (resistance testing may not detect all the viral mutations if the patient has not taken medications for more than four weeks). In this setting, we review the patient's past ART regimens and viral load results as best we can to determine if resistance mutations are likely. We consider individuals to have suspected resistance if they switched ART because of virologic rebound on their prior regimen; received previous suboptimal ART (eg, mono- or dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NRTI] regimens); or have a suppressed HIV RNA level on what appears to be a salvage regimen, but have an unknown resistance mutation history. A discussion of salvage regimens is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-an-antiretroviral-regimen-for-treatment-experienced-hiv-infected-patients-who-are-failing-therapy#H180580730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients who are failing therapy&quot;, section on 'Patients who have failed multiple regimens'</a>.) </p><p>Proviral DNA or &quot;archive&quot; genotype testing may also be helpful when prior resistance testing is not available, since traditional RNA genotypes are not feasible with a suppressed HIV RNA. However, the sensitivity and specificity of DNA genotypes are approximately 75 to 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and a composite of past RNA genotypes is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

However, TAF should generally be avoided in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> and TDF should be avoided in patients with creatinine clearance below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of certain comorbid conditions may lead to drug-drug interactions that impact regimen selection (eg, certain inhaled corticosteroids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a>, should not be combined with a pharmacologic boosting agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cobicistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cobicistat</a>).

However, newer ART regimens, such as those that include integrase inhibitors, are generally better tolerated and require fewer treatment modifications compared with other options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In addition, TAF is associated with reduced nephrotoxicity compared with TDF, and ritonavir-boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a> is generally better tolerated than other protease inhibitors (PIs), including boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1139383077\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term toxicities of current regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may be taking ART regimens that are no longer recommended by major guidelines as first-line therapy, but the viral load is suppressed and the patient appears to be tolerating the medications. In this situation, it is important to assess the potential long-term risks of the specific agents. Examples that a clinician may encounter include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Older nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or older protease inhibitors (PIs) </strong>&ndash; There are certain antiretroviral agents that we always try to change because of increased long-term risk of metabolic and other toxicities. These include older NRTIs (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a>) or PIs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosamprenavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosamprenavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indinavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nelfinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nelfinavir</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=saquinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">saquinavir</a>. This type of regimen update may also benefit the patient by reducing pill burden. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a patient has a suppressed viral load while receiving one of these agents, we generally update the regimen to a preferred first-line ART option or rilpivirine-based therapy. The choice of agent depends upon the patient's prior ART history and resistance mutations, especially if changing from a boosted PI, which has a high barrier to resistance. (See <a href=\"#H4255053366\" class=\"local\">'Ensuring the potency of the new regimen'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First-generation non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (</strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a><strong> or </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a><strong>)</strong> &ndash; If a patient has a suppressed viral load on efavirenz, we inquire about depression and other mental health and central nervous system (CNS) side effects and discuss the pros and cons of updating the ART regimen to a preferred first-line option or to rilpivirine-based therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70143 \">table 1</a>). As an example, if a patient is tolerating efavirenz with a suppressed viral load and no neuropsychiatric side effects, it is not essential to change the medication. However, patients may feel better after a change of therapy even though they did not report significant pre-switch side effects. The change also may benefit lipids and vitamin D levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients#H2957307\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients#H628531661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone and calcium disorders in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Vitamin D'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For the patient taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nevirapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nevirapine</a>, we generally discuss potential advantages of an update (newer options may provide a slightly lower pill burden), though the switch is not essential if the viral load is suppressed. If a patient is tolerating nevirapine and taking twice-daily dosing, updating to the extended-release once-daily dosing version is an option. However, for a patient with a high CD4 count (&gt;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for women, &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for men), if we switch nevirapine to another agent, we prefer to never switch back to nevirapine if other options are available, given a potential risk of serious immune-mediated toxicity. This is discussed in greater detail below. (See <a href=\"#H83888990\" class=\"local\">'Can a patient resume a prior regimen'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Boosted </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a> &ndash; Guideline panels no longer recommend boosted atazanavir as a first-line treatment option because studies have demonstrated reduced tolerability compared with newer agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. In addition, atazanavir has unique side effects, such as indirect hyperbilirubinemia (which can lead to jaundice), kidney stones, and gallstones. It also has more drug-drug interactions than unboosted regimens, such as those that include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>. However, it is not essential to change the medication if there are no tolerability issues. In addition, among boosted PIs, atazanavir is the only agent not linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular events, and it may actually reduce cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In either case, it is important to ensure that the new regimen will maintain virologic suppression. The likelihood that a patient will maintain virologic suppression depends upon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of prior resistance mutations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the new regimen has a relatively high or low barrier to resistance; this is particularly important if the switch involves a change from a regimen with a higher barrier to resistance to a regimen with a lower barrier to resistance.</p><p/><p>A regimen with a relatively high barrier to resistance includes a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or the integrase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> as the third agent. Most other regimens (eg, those that include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilpivirine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilpivirine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elvitegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">elvitegravir</a> as the third agent) have a lower barrier to resistance. </p><p>If switching from a regimen with a high barrier of resistance to a regimen with a low barrier, it is essential to ensure that there are no resistance mutations that could compromise the activity of the nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone. This was demonstrated in the SWITCHMRK 1 and 2 trials, in which participants with suppressed HIV RNA levels taking ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus two NRTIs either continued their current regimen or switched to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a> plus two NRTIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These trials were halted at week 24 because fewer participants in the switch arm maintained virologic suppression and results failed to meet noninferiority criteria. However, in an analysis limited to participants with no history of virologic failure or NRTI-associated resistance mutations, those who switched to raltegravir maintained virologic suppression at a rate noninferior to those who continued the boosted PI. </p><p>Some providers may be concerned about switching to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilpivirine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilpivirine</a> if the pretreatment HIV RNA was above 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> or the CD4 count was below 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> since rilpivirine should not be used in such patients who are treatment na&iuml;ve. However, we generally feel comfortable changing to a rilpivirine-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) option if the patient has had no prior virologic failures or significant NRTI or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations, and the viral load is suppressed at the time of the switch. Clinical trial data suggest that a switch to rilpivirine is safe in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141162903\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with no history of resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If we feel sure the patient has no history of resistance-associated mutations, we generally switch to any of the preferred ART regimens or a rilpivirine-based regimen after a review of comorbid conditions, drug-drug interactions, potential side effects, food requirements, and insurance access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70143 \">table 1</a>). In this setting, where we feel confident there is no resistance that will compromise the new regimen (especially the NRTI combination), we feel comfortable with a switch to a regimen with a greater, equal, or lower barrier to resistance.

In a randomized trial of 577 patients with an HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> on a regimen that included a boosted PI plus a dual-NRTI combination, bictegravir-emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide was noninferior to continuing the PI-based regimen at 48 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antiretroviral-therapy-for-hiv-infected-adults-with-suppressed-viral-loads/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3514403398\" class=\"local\">'Antiretroviral history'</a> above.) </p><p>For patients with known or suspected resistance, selecting a new regimen depends upon the type and number of prior resistance mutations and available active agents.
