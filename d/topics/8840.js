It is more common in males than females (4:1 to 6:1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/1,6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-11</a>] and in infants born preterm as compared with those born at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Approximately 30 to 40 percent of cases occur in first-born children (approximately 1.5-fold increased risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/8,9,12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,12,15</a>], and it is less common in infants of older mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Symptoms usually begin between 3 and 5 weeks of age, and very rarely occur after 12 weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is unclear but probably is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Neonatal hypergastrinemia and gastric hyperacidity may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Prematurity (&lt;37 weeks gestation) may be a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; one study reported an incidence of 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">99/1000</span> in preterm infants compared with 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">25/1000</span> in term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H419243025\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk for IHPS by 1.5 to 2.0-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/12,13,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,16,20</a>]. Several studies have suggested that bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding increases the risk for IHPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/14,16,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,21-24</a>]. In particular, a large population-based study from Denmark found that bottle feeding during the first four months of life increased the risk for IHPS more than fourfold (hazard ratio [HR] 4.62, 95% CI 2.78-7.65), and a similar increase in risk was seen for infants that were both bottle- and breastfed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Most of the included subjects used formula for bottle feeds rather than expressed breast milk, so the study did not delineate whether the increased risk is related to the formula or to the mechanism of bottle feeding. Similarly, a large study from Washington state also found that bottle feeding increased the risk for IHPS after adjustment for sex and maternal smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.31, 95% CI 1.81-2.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32312292\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial aggregation of pyloric stenosis was examined in a large population registry from Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Significant familial aggregation was noted, with a nearly 200-fold higher rate among monozygotic twins and a 20-fold increase among dizygotic twins or siblings, as compared with individuals with no affected relatives. The heritability estimate from this study was 87 percent. The maternal and paternal contributions to heritability were similar, suggesting that the intrauterine environment was not an important causal factor.</p><p>Several genetic loci that confer a predisposition to IHPS have been identified. A genome-wide association study identified a susceptibility locus that contains the apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) gene cluster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This finding provides a possible mechanistic explanation for observed associations between low plasma cholesterol at birth and risk of IHPS. The study also confirmed previous findings of two other susceptibility loci (near MBNL1 and NKX2-5), which are small contributors to overall risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Macrolide antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">erythromycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">azithromycin</a> are associated with increased risk of IHPS, particularly when administered to infants younger than two weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/7,27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27-31</a>]. The risk of IHPS with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clarithromycin</a> is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

One study reported that the association was stronger among female as compared with male offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Cases of pyloric stenosis after the use of oral macrolide antibiotics should be reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety information and adverse event reporting program (MedWatch, <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm&amp;token=SHauxSdf9qNc6lLK16E8IPbyjEFMv8mTkYk65soc8qsZMFRMv9J+X3VuesSuXUid3aLA+xJr6vDaLvZteEOMGQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5890\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic presentation of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is the three- to six-week-old infant who develops immediate postprandial vomiting that is nonbilious and forceful (often described as &quot;projectile&quot; vomiting). The infant then demands to be re-fed soon afterwards (a &quot;hungry vomiter&quot;). These characteristics were seen in a series of 132 infants who were diagnosed with IHPS in the 1970s, in which 91 percent presented with projectile vomiting after feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The majority (83 percent) were boys, and 31 percent were firstborn. In another review of infants diagnosed between 1957 and 1969, the mean age in which the infants began vomiting was 22 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. IHPS rarely occurs after 12 weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Patients were classically described as being emaciated and dehydrated with a palpable &quot;olive-like&quot; mass at the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis muscle in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen (see <a href=\"#H12171690\" class=\"local\">'Palpation of the &ldquo;olive&rdquo;'</a> below). The frequency of palpation of the &quot;olive&quot; typically was quite high (up to 92 percent) in a report from 1975 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], but has been noted to be less common in subsequent reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Laboratory evaluation classically showed a hypochloremic, metabolic alkalosis due to the loss of large amounts of gastric hydrochloric acid, the severity of which depended upon the duration of symptoms prior to initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Similarly, hypokalemia is common in infants who have been vomiting for longer than three weeks but typically is not seen in those with a more recent onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12171008\"><span class=\"h2\">Earlier presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical presentation has changed over time, probably because infants are diagnosed earlier than in the past. Vomiting is still the most common symptom, but infants tend to be better nourished and generally present without significant electrolyte imbalances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This difference was illustrated in a study comparing the presentation of a total of 283 infants diagnosed in the decades prior to 1975, 1985, and 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The mean age at presentation was significantly younger in the more recent decades (mean age was 5.4 weeks in 1975 versus 3.4 weeks in 1995). Electrolyte abnormalities were absent in most infants (88 percent) in all groups. A minority of infants present before two weeks of age, and these infants are more likely to have a positive family history of IHPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These infants tend to have more subtle ultrasonographic abnormalities compared with those presenting after two weeks of age. </p><p>The earlier diagnosis of IHPS might be explained by advances in diagnostic imaging or to an increased awareness of the disorder among clinicians. One study found that clinicians in the modern era were less likely to be able to palpate the pyloric &quot;olive&quot; (from 87 percent to 49 percent in the two different time periods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This finding is probably due to ready availability and reliance on ultrasound to make the diagnosis immediately upon suspicion, so that clinicians in the modern era have less practice at palpating the pyloric &quot;olive&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In addition, infants are now more likely to be evaluated earlier in the course of the disease, when they are well nourished, which makes palpation of &quot;olive&quot; more difficult. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the presenting symptoms described above, the diagnosis of IHPS should be considered in young infants with repeated nonbilious vomiting, hypochloremic alkalosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rapid clinical improvement after rehydration, even in the absence of projectile vomiting or a palpable &quot;olive&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. In a few infants with IHPS (&lt;2 percent), the vomiting may be bilious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>In infants with medical or surgical problems, the presentation may be atypical or the symptoms initially attributed to other etiologies. In infants with congenital anomalies that affect swallowing (eg, central nervous system anomalies, cleft lip and palate), vomiting may not be projectile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In infants with gastrointestinal anomalies, postoperative vomiting may initially be attributed to adhesions or obstruction at an anastomotic site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>In premature infants with IHPS, vomiting may be less forceful, voracious appetite and exaggerated gastric peristalsis may be lacking, and ultrasonographic criteria for diagnosis may not apply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/44,45,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45,47,48</a>]. Premature infants may also present at an older chronological age than term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/19,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,49</a>]. One study found a mean age at presentation of 7.6 weeks in infants born prior to 34 weeks gestation versus 5.4 weeks in term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In hospitalized premature infants, non-projectile vomiting, weight loss, and lethargy may initially be attributed to sepsis; in this case, negative cultures, rapid improvement with intravenous fluids, and metabolic alkalosis (rather than acidosis) in such infants should prompt consideration of IHPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical associations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous clinical associations have been described with IHPS.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most frequent clinical associations of IHPS (occurring in 14 percent of cases in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]). The combination of IHPS and hyperbilirubinemia is known as the icteropyloric syndrome. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is more common than conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and tends to resolve soon after surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In many of these cases, the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is an early manifestation of Gilbert syndrome, a benign condition that is caused by mutations in the bilirubin uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase gene (<em>UGT1A1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/50,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,52</a>].

However, identification of a palpable pylorus (called the &quot;olive&quot;) has fallen from 73 to 27 percent over time, with clinicians in the current era making the diagnosis primarily by pyloric ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p>The olive is felt as a firm mass at the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis muscle in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, about the size and shape of an olive. To palpate the &quot;olive,&quot; the abdomen should be examined when the infant is quiet to avoid interference from tensed abdominal muscles; providing a pacifier dipped in a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucrose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sucrose</a> solution may be helpful to quiet the infant during the examination. Ideally, the examination should be performed immediately after emesis because the mass is less likely to be obscured by a distended antrum. As an alternative, the gastric contents can be emptied with a nasogastric tube, which helps to decompress the distended stomach and enhances the palpability of the pyloric mass. Peristaltic waves may be seen progressing across the child's upper abdomen from left to right just before emesis.</p><p>The abdomen should also be evaluated for distension and bowel sounds. Abdominal distension or high-pitched bowel sounds suggest intestinal obstruction rather than IHPS, especially if associated with bilious vomiting. Such infants should be evaluated promptly with abdominal radiographs. A stool should be visually inspected for mucus and blood, and tested for occult blood. Rectal bleeding raises the possibility of cow's milk protein intolerance in a healthy-appearing infant, or of intussusception in an unwell infant. (See <a href=\"#H93341740\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12171754\"><span class=\"h2\">Other physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infant should also be assessed for the following physical findings to evaluate for complications and to help exclude disorders that can cause symptoms similar to IHPS: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight and length &ndash; To assess nutritional status, especially if the infant has had prolonged vomiting. When serial growth points are available, plotting them on a growth chart helps to establish whether there has been chronic or acute growth failure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucous membranes and skin turgor &ndash; To assess hydration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin and sclerae &ndash; To assess for jaundice, which occurs in patients with IHPS and icteropyloric syndrome, but also raises the possibility of underlying liver disease. The presence of eczema raises suspicion for a food allergy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical associations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H93341740\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genitalia &ndash; To assess for genital ambiguity. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) can present in the neonatal period with adrenal crisis. In female infants, CAH is also associated with virilization of the genitalia. (See <a href=\"#H93341740\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12171779\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most infants with suspected IHPS, and especially in those who are ill-appearing, basic laboratory testing is appropriate to assess for dehydration and electrolyte depletion. At a minimum, the evaluation should include an electrolyte panel, and complete blood count (CBC). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolytes &ndash; Patients with recent onset of symptomatic IHPS usually have normal laboratory results. Those with prolonged symptoms tend to have low serum chloride and potassium, and elevated bicarbonate (a <strong>hypochloremic alkalosis</strong>). Either hypernatremia or hyponatremia may be present. One study showed that serum pH &gt;7.45, chloride &lt;98, and base excess &gt;+3 gave a positive predictive value of 88 percent in diagnosing IHPS in infants presenting with vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By contrast, an infant with a <strong>hyperkalemic acidosis</strong> is unlikely to have IHPS and should be urgently evaluated for other causes, including adrenal crisis (eg, congenital adrenal hyperplasia). (See <a href=\"#H93341740\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine &ndash; To help assess for dehydration and renal insufficiency (eg, pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CBC &ndash; The CBC should be normal in infants with uncomplicated IHPS. Abnormal results do not exclude IHPS, but should raise suspicion of another cause of vomiting (eg, infection). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilirubin &ndash; Infants with jaundice should be evaluated for total and conjugated bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP). Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is consistent with IHPS (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical associations'</a> above). If there are elevations in conjugated bilirubin, ALT or AST, the infant should be evaluated for underlying liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H93341740\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12171545\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the &quot;olive&quot; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peristaltic waves cannot be detected, diagnosis can be confirmed by imaging. Abdominal ultrasound is the procedure of choice at most centers, but an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) contrast study also may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/11,72,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,72,75</a>]. The decision regarding which of these modalities should be the first choice for diagnosis of IHPS varies from center to center and from case to case, depending upon numerous variables, including the likelihood of diagnosis, the level of skill of the ultrasonographer, radiation dose, and relative cost of the procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55355\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55355 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound is the procedure of choice if a sonographer with experience in detecting pyloric stenosis is available. In experienced hands, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography for IHPS are above 95 percent, but the accuracy is operator-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>]. If the ultrasound is negative or equivocal but the patient remains symptomatic, the study should be repeated a few days to a week later. </p><p>IHPS is characterized by a classic &quot;target&quot; sign on transverse view. The measurements most commonly used are pyloric muscle thickness (PMT), pyloric muscle length (PML), and pyloric diameter (PD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F96412\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96412 \">image 1</a>). Criteria defining the upper limits of normal range from PMT 3 to 4 mm, PML 15 to 19 mm, and PD 10 to 14 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. Measurements within or above these ranges support the diagnosis of IHPS. These measurements may not be applicable in premature infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/45,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,47</a>]. Normal values vary with the size of the infant, so results should be interpreted with caution in particularly small or young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/48,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,82,83</a>]. Each of these measurements has been touted as the most reliable of the three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/84-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-87</a>]. However, all three measurements typically are used together in practice. </p><p>Other less frequently proposed ultrasonographic criteria for the diagnosis of IHPS have included pyloric volume (PV) and pyloric ratio (PR). The PV has been defined as equal to 0.25 pi x PD(2) x PML; infants with IHPS were found to have a significantly higher value than were those without IHPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The PR is described as <span class=\"nowrap\">PMT/PD</span> and is significantly higher in infants with IHPS, with a sensitivity and specificity of 96 and 94 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p>Ultrasonographic diagnosis of IHPS has potential pitfalls. The ultrasonographic findings of pylorospasm may, at least transiently, mimic those of IHPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The ultrasonographer also must be aware of potential false-positive readings caused by a fluid-filled duodenal bulb and gastric antrum and false-negative interpretation resulting from poor visualization caused by overlying bowel gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. A posterior sonographic view may be helpful in the latter situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Barium studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An UGI contrast study is generally used only if the physical examination and ultrasonography are nondiagnostic. The classic signs on UGI are an elongated pyloric canal (the &quot;string&quot; sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69939\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69939 \">image 2</a>), two thin tracks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> along the pyloric canal created by compressed pyloric mucosa (the &quot;double-track&quot; sign), a tapered point ending the pyloric canal (the &quot;beak&quot; sign), and a prepyloric bulge of barium (the &quot;shoulder&quot; sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>]. The main disadvantage of an UGI is radiation exposure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Upper endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper endoscopy usually is reserved for patients in whom other imaging modalities are inconclusive, or if warranted to evaluate for another gastrointestinal disorder because of symptoms or signs that are atypical for IHPS. In infants with IHPS, the mucosa of the antrum and pylorus appear thickened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Endoscopy is useful for obtaining tissue sample if eosinophilic gastritis is suspected, as a mimicker of IHPS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12171716\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is suspected when an infant presents with suggestive features as described above. The diagnosis can be confirmed by palpation of an &quot;olive&quot; or by the presence of typical findings on imaging studies. In many centers, ultrasonography is performed to confirm the diagnosis of IHPS prior to surgery, even if an &quot;olive&quot; is palpated.

In most cases, these are easily distinguished from infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) by the history, physical examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> initial laboratory tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-nausea-and-vomiting#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with nausea and vomiting&quot;, section on 'Neonates and young infants'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroesophageal reflux &ndash; Physiologic reflux in newborns and infants is common, and is characterized by effortless regurgitation in an otherwise healthy infant (a &quot;happy spitter&quot;). The regurgitation may seem forceful at times. Physiologic reflux is not associated with electrolyte abnormalities, tends to be chronic rather than progressive, and rarely causes weight loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux in infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cow milk protein intolerance &ndash; Intolerance to cow milk or soy protein typically presents with colitis (blood-tinged stools) but also may affect the small bowel (enteropathy), presenting with recurrent vomiting. The presence of blood-tinged stools in infants who are fed cow milk or soy protein (through formula or through the maternal diet, if breastfed) raises this possibility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenal crisis &ndash; Newborn infants with adrenal insufficiency may present with an adrenal crisis, which is manifested by vomiting and dehydration. This is a life-threatening condition and should be evaluated and treated urgently. Key features of adrenal crisis are disproportionate hypotension and <strong>hyper</strong>kalemic <strong>acid</strong>osis (rather than the hypokalemic alkalosis that is typically seen in IHPS). The most common cause of adrenal insufficiency in infants is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Females with CAH tend to have virilized or ambiguous genitalia; males usually have no obvious genital abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;, section on 'Adrenal crisis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal obstruction &ndash; Causes of intestinal obstruction in early infancy include malrotation (with or without volvulus), Hirschsprung disease, and intussusception. Intestinal obstruction should be considered in infants with bilious vomiting and abdominal distension, especially if high-pitched bowel sounds or bloody stools are present. If intestinal obstruction is suspected, the specific diagnosis is often suggested by the patient's history then confirmed with appropriate radiologic imaging, including a plain radiograph.

Infants with biliary atresia also may have acholic (very pale-colored) stools. Infants with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia should be further evaluated for liver disease, including biliary atresia, biliary cysts, and metabolic disorders.

The timing of surgery depends upon the clinical status of the infant. If the child is well-hydrated with normal electrolytes, and if surgeons with expertise in the procedure are available, surgery may take place on the day of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Surgery should be delayed in the setting of dehydration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrolyte derangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. </p><p>Infants presenting with normal electrolyte values and mild dehydration, as is the case with more than 60 percent of patients, should receive maintenance intravenous fluids such as 5 percent dextrose with &frac14; normal saline (0.22 percent NaCl) and 2 mEq KCl per 100 mL. Infants with moderate or severe dehydration require more intensive fluid management with higher NaCl concentrations (&frac12; normal saline [0.45 percent NaCl] or normal saline [0.9 percent NaCl]) and higher rates of administration (1.5 to 2 times maintenance), perhaps combined with initial administration of a fluid bolus. In severely dehydrated infants, renal function should be assessed prior to adding potassium to the intravenous fluids. If alkalosis is present, this should be corrected prior to surgery because it has been associated with an increased risk of post-operative apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The classical operation for IHPS is Ramstedt pyloromyotomy, which involves a longitudinal incision of the hypertrophic pylorus with blunt dissection to the level of the submucosa; it relieves the constriction and allows normal passage of stomach contents into the duodenum. Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74120\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74120 \">picture 1</a>) is a minimally invasive version of the Ramstedt procedure that has been associated with a lower incidence of postoperative emesis and a shorter hospital stay, but occasionally results in incomplete pyloromyotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/101-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">101-105</a>]. A transumbilical approach also may be used but has longer operating time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p>Open and laparoscopic pyloromyotomy were compared in a prospective trial in 200 infants with ultrasonographically confirmed IHPS, who were randomly assigned to open or laparoscopic pyloromyotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. There were no differences between groups in operating time, time to full feeding, or length of stay. However, infants in the laparoscopic group had fewer episodes of emesis (1.9 versus 2.6) and received fewer doses of analgesia (1.6 versus 2.2) than those in the open group. A similar randomized study also reported more rapid return to enteral feeding and shorter hospital stay among infants treated laparoscopically, although in 3 to 5 percent of laparoscopically performed cases the pyloromyotomy was incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. The study was performed at six centers with extensive experience in laparoscopic techniques.</p><p>Feeding can be resumed in most infants within a few hours after surgery. Modest regurgitation occurs in as many as 80 percent of infants after pyloromyotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and should not delay feedings. Vigorous post-operative vomiting is infrequent. In a meta-analysis, infants offered ad-lib feedings four hours after operation tolerated full feedings sooner and had a shorter hospital stay compared with infants receiving an incremental feeding schedule, despite having more emesis episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Radiologic evaluation should be performed if vomiting persists beyond five days postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>], with the understanding that interpretation of the study may be difficult because of postoperative swelling.</p><p>Infants with IHPS are at risk for apnea postoperatively because of their young age and effects of anesthesia; we suggest monitoring for apnea for at least 24 hours postoperatively. Those with underlying alkalosis may be at increased risk based on limited and inferential data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. As mentioned above, this is one reason why alkalosis and other electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected prior to surgery. </p><p>The rate of serious complications from pyloromyotomy is low. A review of cases from the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow, Scotland showed a decrease in mortality of IHPS from 59 percent in 1925 to 0 percent in 1975, as a result of surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Mucosal perforations occur in about 1 percent of patients and are readily recognized intraoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Wound complications occur in about 3 percent of patients treated with a laparoscopic approach and 7 percent of those undergoing open pyloromyotomy. The pyloromyotomy is incomplete in 2 to 6 percent of patients treated with a laparoscopic approach and is rare in those undergoing the open procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17026736\"><span class=\"h2\">Balloon dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopically guided balloon dilation for IHPS has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. However, because balloon dilatation does not reliably disrupt the seromuscular ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>], attempts at this technique are best reserved for patients in whom general anesthesia would pose a significant risk or in whom a surgical approach to the pylorus is not possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17026846\"><span class=\"h2\">Conservative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative management of infants with IHPS using anticholinergics has also been described. This approach typically involves a trial of continuous nasoduodenal feedings, generally lasting several months, until the obstructive process becomes less significant as the infant gains weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Oral and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a> sulfate (which relaxes the pyloric musculature) also have been described in small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/114-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">114-118</a>]. Small nonrandomized studies and a meta-analysis suggest that oral treatment with atropine sulfate is effective in about 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/118-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">118-120</a>]. Because data on conservative management are very limited, and because surgery is both safe and effective, we suggest conservative management only for infants in whom a surgical approach is either not advisable or not feasible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

In particular, IHPS has been associated with the administration of macrolide antibiotics to infants during the first few weeks of life, and perhaps to their mothers during last gestation or lactation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms usually begin between three and five weeks of age, and very rarely occur after 12 weeks of age. Typical presenting symptoms are nonbilious vomiting that is forceful and occurs immediately after feeding, while the infant remains hungry. A firm &quot;olive-like&quot; mass may be palpable in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and there may be signs of dehydration. In a few infants, the vomiting may be bilious. In the past, infants were often malnourished at presentation. In premature infants with IHPS the vomiting may be less forceful, and they may not display hunger. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most infants with suspected IHPS, and especially in those who are ill-appearing, basic laboratory testing is appropriate to assess for dehydration and electrolyte depletion. At a minimum, the evaluation should include an electrolyte panel, venous pH, and complete blood count (CBC). Infants with IHPS may have normal results or may have low serum chloride and potassium, and elevated bicarbonate (a hypochloremic alkalosis). (See <a href=\"#H12171779\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of IHPS is usually established by abdominal ultrasound, on which IHPS is characterized by increased pyloric muscle thickness length and diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F96412\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96412 \">image 1</a>). The accuracy of ultrasound for the diagnosis of IHPS is operator-dependent. Characteristic signs also can be seen on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> contrast studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69939\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69939 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12171545\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of IHPS includes physiologic gastroesophageal reflux and cow's milk protein intolerance, which are relatively benign. More severe disorders that may present with vomiting in the first two months of life, include adrenal crisis, intestinal obstruction (eg, due to malrotation, Hirschsprung disease, or intussusception), and liver disease (eg, biliary atresia or metabolic defects). These disorders should be considered in infants with atypical presenting features, including hypotension, vomiting that is bilious, abdominal distension, or jaundice with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94332\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94332 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H93341740\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IHPS is typically treated with surgical pyloromyotomy. If the child is well-hydrated with normal electrolytes, and if surgeons with expertise in the procedure are available, surgery may take place on the day of diagnosis. Surgery should be delayed in the setting of dehydration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrolyte derangements. Mild regurgitation after pyloromyotomy is common and should not delay the initiation of feeding. (See <a href=\"#H17026729\" class=\"local\">'Pyloromyotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-hypertrophic-pyloric-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">To T, Wajja A, Wales PW, Langer JC.
