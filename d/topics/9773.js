More commonly, the LCL is injured along with other structures, often including those of the posterolateral corner of the knee but also possibly the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments, during more significant trauma. The care of uncomplicated, minor LCL injuries can be supervised by primary care clinicians, but more severe injuries warrant orthopedic referral.</p><p>The presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, and nonoperative management of LCL injuries are reviewed here. Other knee injuries and an overall approach to knee complaints in active adults are discussed separately.

The primary posterolateral stabilizing structures are commonly considered to be the LCL, popliteus tendon, and the popliteofibular ligament (PFL). Other stabilizing structures include the biceps femoris and lateral gastrocnemius muscles and tendons; and the popliteal meniscal, fabellofibular, oblique popliteal, and arcuate ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>In addition, as an independent structure, the LCL acts as a barrier to varus instability at all angles of knee flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The LCL may also act with the other primary posterolateral structures to prevent posterior translation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and external rotation of the tibia on the femur during early knee flexion (0 to 30 degrees) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. As knee angles increase beyond 60 degrees, the LCL provides less restraint against external rotation compared to the PFL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and beyond 70 degrees, it does not provide significant resistance to external rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8812767\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injury to the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) represents approximately 8 percent of all knee injuries, making it the second least commonly injured knee ligament, the posterior cruciate ligament being the least injured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Of the knee injuries treated in this study, the LCL was involved in 2.5 percent of cases. In one large retrospective study, approximately 48.9 percent of cases involving LCL injuries were treated with surgery, but half of these cases involved multiple injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Data pertaining to the epidemiology of posterolateral corner knee injuries are extremely limited, but such injuries are often associated with injuries to other knee ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8812773\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although specific risk factors for lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury have not been elucidated, several have been identified for knee injuries in general. Female gender, sports competition (versus practice), higher rates of player-to-player contact, and participation in sports that involve significant pivoting, jumping, and landing are associated with higher knee injury rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among 20 popular high school sports in the United States, American football has the highest overall knee injury rate (6.29 per 10,000 athlete exposures). According to a large, retrospective Swiss study, soccer (football) and skiing accounted for the largest number of knee injuries, but tennis and gymnastics involved the largest number of LCL injuries, which were relatively uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Risk factors for soft tissue injuries of the knee of all types among United States Army soldiers include prior knee injury, increasing length of service, increasing age, prior combat deployment, infantry occupation, prior ankle injury, and prior hip injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8812779\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The soft tissue structures about the lateral knee, often termed the &ldquo;lateral complex,&rdquo; are arranged in layers that sometimes appear indistinguishable. Layers of the lateral complex, from superficial to deep, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First layer &ndash; Iliotibial band, superficial portion of biceps femoris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70825\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70825 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98262 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second layer &ndash; Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70435\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70435 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98264 \">figure 3</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third layer &ndash; Joint capsule, arcuate ligament, popliteofibular ligament, popliteus tendon </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overall properties of the LCL</strong> &ndash; The LCL typically measures approximately 4 to 5 mm in width and 60 mm in length, and is more cord-like and thicker than the fan-like medial collateral ligament (MCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The stiffness of the two collateral ligaments is comparable, although the tensile strength of the LCL is half that of the MCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Unlike the MCL, the LCL does not attach to the meniscus or joint capsule because of the intervening popliteus tendon. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Origin and insertion</strong> &ndash; The LCL originates on the lateral femoral condyle on the external tuberosity at a point just anterior to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The exact location is at a point just posterior and proximal to the lateral epicondyle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The LCL originates posterior to the origination of the popliteal tendon. After traversing the posterolateral joint line extra-articularly, the LCL inserts on the anterior point of the fibular head as a component of the conjoined tendon along with the biceps femoris tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Examination landmarks</strong> &ndash; The LCL is best palpated with the patient in the supine position with knee flexed 90 degrees. The ligament will become even more prominent in the &ldquo;figure four&rdquo; position (knee flexed 90 degrees and hip externally rotated to place the ankle on the contralateral lower leg). Alternatively, the patient can be placed in a supine position with their knee flexed to 90 degrees and feet flat on the table without hip rotation. This alternative position can be useful in patients with limited hip or knee mobility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of the potential difficulty differentiating among the LCL, biceps femoris tendon, and iliotibial band at the joint line, the examiner should begin palpation at the external femoral condyle and follow the cord-like LCL distally as it courses across the joint line towards the fibular head. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood and nerve supply</strong> &ndash; Blood supply to the LCL is from the genicular network of arteries that arise from the popliteal artery, with primary contributions from the superior and inferior lateral genicular arteries. Innervation of the LCL varies among individuals. Nevertheless, all local nerves arise from the common fibular nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8812829\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated injuries of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) are relatively uncommon. Most occur in association with injuries to the posterolateral corner (PLC), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The most common mechanism of injury producing multi-ligament knee injury involves a high energy force that combines hyperextension and varus moments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Alternatively, injury may occur with an isolated varus hyperextension or external tibial rotation force. Typically, an isolated LCL injury, especially of lower grade, is caused by a primarily varus force (eg, knee forced laterally from a blow to the medial side). </p><p>Injuries that may occur in association with a LCL tear include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue structures of the posterolateral corner</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior cruciate ligament (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cruciate-ligament-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anterior cruciate ligament injury&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior cruciate ligament</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral meniscus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meniscal-injury-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meniscal injury of the knee&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8812835\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8812842\"><span class=\"h2\">Common presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have sustained a lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury typically present following a blow to the medial or anteromedial aspect of their knee while it was fully extended, and report lateral or posterolateral knee pain. The prototypical example is of an American football player who, in the process of being tackled, is struck in the knee, which sustains a posterior varus shift while the foot is planted and knee hyperextended. </p><p>Alternatively, patients can sustain a noncontact LCL injury from a sudden varus moment (knee bending laterally) while the knee is hyperextending. Both contact and noncontact LCL injuries can involve varying degrees of tibial rotation as a component of the injury force. Patients often describe a sense of knee instability when ambulatory or stationary. </p><p>Following a LCL injury, patients may experience one or several mechanical knee symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locking or catching with movement (if meniscal injury is also involved)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving out under stress or with any rapid motion while bearing weight (eg, moving from side to side, rotating the knee) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8812848\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On initial inspection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98262\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98262 \">figure 2</a>), patients with a LCL injury (particularly those involving the posterolateral corner [PLC]) may demonstrate a &ldquo;varus thrust gait&rdquo; as the LCL fails to maintain stability and prevent excessive lateral opening. A varus thrust gait can be observed during foot strike when a gap develops in the lateral side of the knee and the patient shifts their weight to reduce their knee back to normal alignment. </p><p>Another compensatory gait pattern in which the patient maintains a flexed knee and does not allow it to reach full extension can be seen in the LCL injured patient. During the swing phase, the patient may demonstrate excess internal rotation of their tibia, and avoid complete extension of their knee in an effort to avoid a feeling of instability. During the stance phase, genu recurvatum from a hyperextended knee may be observed. </p><p>The most common examination finding in patients with a LCL injury is tenderness along the lateral knee (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89740\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89740 \">picture 2</a>). Localized soft tissue swelling may be appreciated at the site of injury. </p><p>Varus stress testing (described separately) at both full extension and 30 degrees of knee flexion is the most useful initial test to assess the severity of a LCL injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89745\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89745 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional special tests that can be used to help confirm the presence of a more complicated posterolateral soft tissue injury include the four listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The test characteristics of these maneuvers are not well studied, but when in agreement (ie, all positive or all negative) they can help to rule in or rule out PLC injury. However, for the patient in pain, it may not be feasible to perform all four maneuvers. Many experienced clinicians perform the posterolateral drawer test and the dial test. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>External rotation recurvatum test</strong> &ndash; With the patient in a supine position, the examiner provides a stabilizing force to the femur by applying downward pressure at the level of the quadriceps tendon (suprapatellar). Next, the examiner uses their contralateral hand to lift the great toe upward while externally rotating the tibia. Excessive motion compared with the contralateral knee is indicative of posterolateral rotatory instability. A positive external rotation recurvatum test raises the possibility of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and the ACL should be carefully examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anterior-cruciate-ligament-injury#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anterior cruciate ligament injury&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posterolateral drawer test</strong> &ndash; With the patient supine (with knee flexed 90 degrees, foot flat on table, and tibia externally rotated 15 degrees), the examiner introduces a combined posterior and external rotation force through the proximal tibia while observing the rotation of the tibial tubercle in reference to the femur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Excessive rotation compared with the asymptomatic side suggests a high grade PLC injury, often with popliteofibular ligament <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> popliteal tendon involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reverse shift test</strong> &ndash; After placing the patient in the position described above for the posterolateral drawer test, the examiner extends the knee while applying a valgus and external rotation force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In the presence of a severe PLC injury, the iliotibial band can be seen reducing the posteriorly subluxed tibia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dial test (30, 90 degrees)</strong> &ndash; With the patient prone, hold their feet and passively rotate the tibia externally, first with the knees at 30 degrees of flexion and then at 90 degrees of flexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93946\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93946 \">picture 4</a>). A difference of more than 10 to 15 degrees of external rotation compared with the uninjured side suggests PLC injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-knee#H133527378\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the knee&quot;, section on 'Tests for PCL injury and posterior stability'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Although these tests are useful for the diagnosis of a combined LCL-PLC injury, a positive maneuver may stem from an isolated PLC injury without LCL involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8812872\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injuries that occur in association with a LCL tear can include the following structures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue structures of the posterolateral corner, including popliteus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior cruciate ligament</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior cruciate ligament</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral meniscus </p><p/><p>Given how often LCL tears occur in association with other significant knee injuries, the clinician should examine all these structures in any patient with lateral knee pain following trauma, except when this is not possible due to the extent of injury or degree of pain.</p><p>Lateral knee trauma may involve injury of the common peroneal or superficial peroneal nerve. Therefore, it is important to assess sensation and lower extremity strength (dorsiflexion, eversion) in all patients presenting with a lateral knee injury. As partial injury of the peroneal nerves may be subtle, it can be useful to observe the patient&rsquo;s gait while watching specifically for a foot drop. Inability to maintain dorsiflexion of the foot during heel walking may reveal a more subtle foot drop that is not observed on casual ambulation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65272789\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification of LCL injury</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 &ndash; Mild sprain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 1 injuries of the LCL result in localized tenderness.

There is typically laxity without a solid endpoint and the patient experiences one or more mechanical symptoms. These injuries are often associated with posterolateral corner (PLC) pathology. </p><p/><p>Often the extent of injury is difficult to determine and the exact grading of a LCL injury is not always clear. This is especially true in the setting of an acute knee injury where pain and swelling can make examination maneuvers less reliable. Therefore, it is appropriate to treat all but the mildest acute LCL injuries as Grade 3 initially.

In cases involving more significant trauma to the knee, we generally obtain plain radiographs as described immediately below, in addition to performing an ultrasound examination. We obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the knee, if available, in all cases of significant knee trauma in which the history, examination, and possibly ultrasound findings suggest that major injury involving the LCL and other structures (eg, cruciate ligament, meniscus) may have occurred. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8812892\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Damage to the LCL cannot be seen on plain radiographs. However, we obtain anteroposterior and lateral views of the knee in all cases involving more than minor knee trauma when a LCL injury is suspected, and especially if there is bony tenderness of the medial aspect of the femur, tibia, or patella.

In addition, tenderness from a LCL injury is often longitudinal directly over the course of the ligament, whereas tenderness from a meniscal injury is generally circumferential (coronal plane) along the joint line.

Whereas LCL injuries can cause pain at the lateral femoral epicondyle, popliteus injuries cause pain at the origin of the popliteus, which is just distal to the lateral femoral epicondyle. Testing of the popliteus includes the &ldquo;shoe removal maneuver,&rdquo; which is performed by having the patient internally rotate the affected leg and use their toes isometrically to push the shoe off of the contralateral heel. The test is considered positive if the patient&rsquo;s pain is reproduced while performing the maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Another examination maneuver that can be employed to diagnose popliteus injury is the Garrick test.

With such injuries, pain and swelling develop over the lateral knee. Pain can be reproduced by translation of the fibular head in an anteroposterior direction, a finding not seen in LCL injuries. Proximal tibiofibular syndesmosis injury can occur concomitantly with a distal tibiofibular syndesmosis injury or tibial fracture. A syndesmosis injury can result in a falsely positive varus test, as the fibular head moves with varus stressing.

Unlike LCL injuries, ITB syndrome is typically not associated with any specific incident but develops gradually. Pain is typically reported to be at the distal lateral femoral epicondyle and can be reproduced and exacerbated by applying pressure at this location while cycling the knee between extension and flexion (Nobles test).

Care should be given to avoid cold injury to the common peroneal nerve in the posterolateral knee by applying ice no longer than 15 minutes at a time or by using ice massage rather than continuous application, usually no more often than every two hours. When the injury grade is unclear, we recommend 48 to 72 hours of rest, ice, compression, and protection with a knee immobilizer while awaiting definitive imaging and reevaluation. Optimally, however, an early determination of injury grade will provide prognostic information and allow early treatment.</p><p>Protection of the injured posterolateral structures from further injury is important for treatment. This assists in pain control, healing, and prevention of further injury. We use the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 &ndash; Crutches for up to a week if needed for pain control; hinged bracing (medial and lateral stabilization but allowing flexion and extension) for four to five weeks during all weight-bearing </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2 &ndash; Crutches and knee immobilizer for one to three weeks for pain control, then progress from non-weight-bearing to partial-weight-bearing in weeks two or three. A hinged brace may be used once the patient is partial-weight-bearing, usually at two to three weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 &ndash; Immobilization, non-weight-bearing with crutches, and consultation with an orthopedic surgeon. Immobilization will likely be maintained until surgery is performed, preferably within two weeks of injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although surgery generally recommended in the presence of instability, there is at least one case report of successful conservative management, consisting of selective functional strengthening, proprioceptive training, and the gradual introduction of graded sport-specific activities, for an isolated Grade 3 injury with increased laxity in an adolescent athlete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p>Activity must be modified to avoid cutting and pivoting movements, collisions, and any activities that cause pain. Low-impact, painless aerobic activity, such as low resistance bicycling, should be encouraged, and upper body resistance training is permitted, but lower body resistance training must be modified to avoid stressing the injured structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8813206\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP AND DEFINITIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated Grade 1 and 2 lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injuries usually do not require surgery, but early referral to physical therapy for rehabilitation is important for recovery. In contrast, any injury with functional instability or associated injuries of the posterolateral corner (PLC), menisci, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) warrants timely referral to an orthopedic surgeon. Early surgical repair is usually required in such cases. In addition, orthopedic referral is recommended for all Grade 3 LCL injuries because of the propensity for a poor outcome with conservative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Of note, not all isolated Grade 3 LCL injuries result in functional instability and necessitate surgical intervention, but repair of grade 3 injuries with PLC damage may be necessary and orthopedic referral is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lateral-collateral-ligament-injury-and-related-posterolateral-corner-injuries-of-the-knee/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Management of Grade 1 and 2 injuries is nonoperative and should include relative rest from activities that place the injured ligament at risk of reinjury. This may require restriction from competitive play for 4 to 12 weeks and modification of occupational activities. Rehabilitative exercise may begin with gentle range of motion and isometric strength exercise, and progress to isotonic strength exercise and light aerobic activity as ROM and strength improve. Whenever possible, we suggest that patients perform their rehabilitation under the supervision of a knowledgeable physical therapist or athletic trainer. A general plan for the rehabilitation of isolated, uncomplicated Grade 1 and Grade 2 LCL injuries is found in the attached table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98272 \">table 1</a>). During activity, patients recovering from such injuries may benefit from the added support provided by an elastic wrap or taping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100203\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100203 \">picture 8</a>). Grade 1 or 2 injuries that fail to make progress or worsen after four weeks of conservative management should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon.</p><p>Grade 1 and 2 LCL injuries should be seen for reevaluation approximately two weeks after initial assessment. This provides an opportunity for repeat examination with less guarding than is often present shortly after the injury. Concomitant injuries that were missed on initial examination may be detected at this time. At follow-up, compliance with immobilization and bracing can be assessed, and the importance of supervised rehabilitation can be emphasized. Serial imaging is not necessary, but clinicians facile with ultrasound often perform a reexamination to assess residual swelling. </p><p>After this initial follow-up visit, patients are seen approximately every two weeks for the first two months and monthly thereafter, if surveillance remains necessary to monitor progress and determine when a return to work or sport is possible. Gentle reassessment of range of motion, strength, and ligamentous laxity are useful for monitoring progress during follow-up visits. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8813135\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8813142\"><span class=\"h2\">Unrecognized posterolateral corner injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posterolateral corner (PLC) injury can be difficult to diagnose and may be missed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Weight-bearing status and the level of protection needed for the knee joint vary according to the severity of injury. The details of initial management and a plan for follow-up care are provided in the text. Isolated, minor LCL injuries are typically managed with physical therapy; orthopedic referral is obtained for more complicated injuries involving the LCL.
