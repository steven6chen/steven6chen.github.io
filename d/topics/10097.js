These drugs differ with respect to mechanism of action and to the degree and type of lipid altering.</p><p>Most patients for whom a prescription drug therapy is deemed advisable will have an elevation in their low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level and a statin is the established first line therapy. Other lipid lowering drugs are used to augment statin effects on LDL-C, substitute for statins when that class cannot be used, or to treat non-LDL-C disorders, primarily hypertriglyceridemia. The decision to use a non-statin drug can be influenced by clinical parameters other than the lipid values themselves. </p><p>The characteristics, efficacy, and safety of the lipid-lowering drugs other than the statins and PCSK9 inhibitors will be reviewed here. The efficacy of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors is discussed elsewhere.

It is the most commonly prescribed low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering agent after statins. Addition discussion of the clinical use of ezetimibe are presented separately.

A genetic study found an association between having a single inactivating mutation (heterozygous state) for NPC1L1 and lower LDL-C, and also lower risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD), providing biologic support that a medication that blocks NPC1L1 might be expected to reduce the risk of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> at a dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> reduced LDL-C by approximately 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Ezetimibe is also effective as adjunctive therapy to a statin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]; in one study, a 10 mg dose of ezetimibe lowered LDL-C by 14 percent below the LDL lowering effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>IMPROVE-IT, the first large trial to directly assess clinical outcomes with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> plus a statin compared with a statin alone, found that after a median follow-up of six years, patients with an acute coronary syndrome randomized to <span class=\"nowrap\">ezetimibe/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a></span> had a lower rate of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina, coronary revascularization 30 or more days after randomization, or stroke) than those randomized to simvastatin alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99; seven-year event rates 32.7 versus 34.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. All-cause mortality (HR 0.99) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.00) were not reduced. Adverse events were similar in the two arms. The benefits on cardiovascular end points provide support for LDL-C lowering with this drug. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Randomized trials, such as the SHARP trial in patients with chronic kidney disease, found reductions in cardiovascular end points with the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, trials of this sort cannot be used to demonstrate additional clinical benefit from ezetimibe beyond what would be expected with a statin alone. </p><p>A trial of the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> in patients with aortic stenosis, SEAS, found an increased risk of cancer and cancer death in the active treatment arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Statins do not appear to increase the risk of cancer, which raised the possibility that ezetimibe treatment could cause cancer. Because of this concern, an interim analysis of two other trials of simvastatin and ezetimibe (IMPROVE-IT and SHARP) was performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This analysis found no increased risk of incident cancer but a trend toward an increase in cancer deaths. However, an early increase in cancer deaths in a trial without an increase in incident cancer would be somewhat unusual. We feel the observed effects on cancer and cancer deaths are most likely due to chance. In a preliminary report of the final analysis of the SHARP trial, there continued to be no increase in cancer incidence with ezetimibe but there was a statistically nonsignificant increase in cancer deaths (3.2 versus 2.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; the final analysis of IMPROVE-IT showed no increase in cancer (10.2 percent in each arm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The precise role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> relative to other lipid lowering drugs is unclear. Similar reductions in LDL-C can often be achieved simply by maximizing the dose of statins. As an example, one randomized trial found that the reduction in LDL-C concentration was the same with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> 10 mg plus ezetimibe as with atorvastatin 80 mg alone; however, adding ezetimibe to atorvastatin 80 mg did result in an additional 9 percent reduction in LDL-C concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering-with-drugs-other-than-statins-and-pcsk9-inhibitors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Ezetimibe plus atorvastatin also produced a greater reduction in serum C-reactive protein than atorvastatin alone.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ezetimibe</a> may be helpful for avoiding high doses of statins (and potentially increased susceptibility to muscle injury) in patients who do not meet cholesterol goals on low-dose statin therapy alone.
