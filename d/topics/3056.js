The etiologies of female infertility will be reviewed here. Evaluation and treatment of female infertility are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-female-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for female infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Causes of male infertility are also discussed elsewhere.

The remaining couples had unexplained infertility or became pregnant during the study. The most common identifiable female factors, which accounted for 81 percent of female infertility, were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovulatory disorders (25 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometriosis (15 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic adhesions (12 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubal blockage (11 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other tubal abnormalities (11 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperprolactinemia (7 percent)</p><p/><p>With advancing female age, there is an increase in the percentage of women with age-related infertility. In addition, other factors that may reduce fertility, such as leiomyomas, tubal disease, and endometriosis, also increase. A reduction in coital frequency with increasing age also impacts fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18439130\"><span class=\"h1\">OVARY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovulatory disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infrequent ovulation (oligoovulation) or absent ovulation (anovulation) results in infertility because an oocyte is not available every month for fertilization. Women who report monthly menses and molimina (breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea, bloating) are typically ovulatory. If menses and molimina are irregular or absent, pregnancy or another condition associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">oligoovulation/anovulation</span> is likely. Potential causes are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79628\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79628 \">table 1</a>) (see individual topic reviews for more information on each disorder). </p><p>The World Health Organization has classified anovulation into three main groups, and recognizes hyperprolactinemia as additional etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69734 \">table 2</a>). This system is useful for defining and treating anovulatory disorders according to the underlying endocrine dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Oocyte aging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age is an important factor affecting a woman's fertility (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50854\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50854 \">figure 1</a>). The decrease in fecundability with aging is likely due to a decline in both the quantity and quality of the oocytes. </p><p>The germ cell complement of the ovary reaches its apex of 6 to 7 million follicles in the mid-gestation female fetus, followed by a steady attrition from 1 to 2 million follicles at birth to 300,000 follicles at the onset of puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The rate of follicle loss accelerates after the woman reaches her mid-thirties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy&quot;</a>.) Other insults to the ovary such as cigarette smoking, radiation, chemotherapy, and autoimmune disease also accelerate follicular loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Women with a depleted ovarian follicle pool may continue to ovulate regularly, but have infertility due to the poor quality of oocytes remaining in the terminal follicular pool. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian failure due to anticancer drugs and radiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and causes of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The loss of oocyte quality as a woman ages is thought to be due to an increase in meiotic nondisjunction. Hypothesized mechanisms involve differences between germ cells when formed during fetal life, damage in germ cells that accumulates over the course of a woman&rsquo;s life, or age-related changes in the quality of the granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81102118\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review of epidemiologic data, drawn mainly from comparative studies and cohorts, concluded that it is unclear whether small (&lt;3 to 6 cm) ovarian cysts have a role in infertility and that the effects of surgical treatment are often more harmful than the cyst itself to the ovarian reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Most of these data involved endometriomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas#H6362327\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Management of ovarian endometriomas&quot;, section on 'Treatment of subfertility'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FALLOPIAN TUBE ABNORMALITIES/PELVIC ADHESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tubal disease and pelvic adhesions prevent normal transport of the oocyte and sperm through the fallopian tube. The primary cause of tubal factor infertility is pelvic inflammatory disease caused by pathogens such as chlamydial or gonorrhea. Other conditions that may interfere with tubal transport include severe endometriosis (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Endometriosis'</a> below), adhesions from previous surgery or nontubal infection (eg, appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease), pelvic tuberculosis, and salpingitis isthmica nodosa (ie, diverticulosis of the fallopian tube). Proximal tubal blockage may result from plugs of mucus and amorphous debris or spasm of the uterotubal ostium, but does not reflect true anatomic occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-infertility-in-women-with-endometriosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of infertility in women with endometriosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women with distal tubal obstruction may develop hydrosalpinges, which decrease the success rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF). In addition to obstruction to sperm migration, hydrosalpinges appear to reduce fertility by retrograde flow of tubal contents into the endometrial cavity, which creates a hostile environment to implantation of an embryo. Removal of the hydrosalpinges increases the success of IVF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-surgery-for-female-infertility#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive surgery for female infertility&quot;, section on 'Salpingectomy before in vitro fertilization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18439152\"><span class=\"h1\">UTERUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired implantation, either mechanical or due to reduced endometrial receptivity, are the basis of uterine causes of infertility. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine leiomyomata</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine leiomyomata are common benign smooth muscle monoclonal tumors. A meta-analysis of studies comparing women with infertility and leiomyomata versus infertile controls showed that only leiomyomata with a submucosal or intracavitary component were associated with lower pregnancy and implantation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When women with submucous myomas underwent myomectomy, pregnancy rates increased significantly compared to infertile controls. Thus, it appears that only those fibroids with a submucosal or an intracavitary component are associated with decreased fecundability. The likely mechanism is inhibition to normal implantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-issues-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive issues in women with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine abnormalities are thought to cause infertility by interfering with normal implantation. M&uuml;llerian anomalies are a significant cause of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), with the septate uterus associated with the poorest reproductive outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other structural abnormalities associated with infertility include endometrial polyps, and synechiae from prior pregnancy-related curettage. However, data establishing a causal link between these uterine abnormalities and infertility are lacking.

A 2015 committee opinion from the American Society of Reproductive Medicine concluded that &ldquo;although progesterone is important for the process of implantation and early embryonic development, luteal phase defect (LPD) as an independent entity causing infertility has not been proven&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There are no agreed upon definitions, diagnostic tests, or treatments for LPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We agree that endometrial dating is not useful for evaluating or guiding treatment of infertile women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-female-infertility/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOMETRIOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanisms which decrease fertility in women with endometriosis include anatomic distortion from pelvic adhesions, damage to ovarian tissue by endometrioma formation and surgical resection, and the production of substances such as cytokines and growth factors which impair the normal processes of ovulation, fertilization, and implantation.

Congenital malformations and trauma to the cervix (including surgery) may result in stenosis and inability of the cervix to produce normal mucus, thereby impairing fertility.

Immune testing of infertile couples in clinical practice is not supported by existing data and treatments administered to address abnormal results on immunological testing solely for the purpose of improving fertility have not been proven to be beneficial and may cause harm. </p><p>Women with some autoimmune diseases are at increased risk of infertility unrelated to direct effects of these antibodies on fertilization and implantation. For example, premature ovarian failure has also been described in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&nbsp;and myasthenia gravis.
