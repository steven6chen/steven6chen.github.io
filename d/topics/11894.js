Thus, a significant number of patients who are undergoing surgery may have concomitant thyroid disease. Although most patients with well-compensated thyroid disease do not need special consideration prior to surgery, patients who have a newly diagnosed thyroid disorder around the time of surgery require a discussion of the risks and benefits of proceeding with surgery.</p><p>The issues surrounding thyroid disease in patients undergoing nonthyroid surgery are discussed here. The management of patients with hyperthyroidism undergoing thyroid surgery is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hyperthyroidism#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Preoperative preparation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492117\"><span class=\"h1\">IS PREOPERATIVE MEASUREMENT OF TSH NECESSARY?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the relatively high prevalence of thyroid disease in the general population, we believe there is no need to screen for thyroid disease during the preoperative medical consultation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, if the history and physical examination are suggestive of thyroid disease, it is reasonable to try to make the diagnosis since it can have effects upon perioperative management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with known thyroid disease taking thyroid medication, monitoring of thyroid function on at least an annual basis is part of routine care. Adjustments in dosing are made as needed to maintain euthyroidism. In these patients with well-compensated thyroid disease, we and others believe that additional testing prior to surgery is unnecessary, as long as the patient is on a stable dose of medication and euthyroidism was documented within the past three to six months.

However, the definitions of mild, moderate, and severe hypothyroidism can be vague, and definitions may differ between experts or studies. We find the following definitions useful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe hypothyroidism</strong> &ndash; Includes patients with myxedema coma; with severe clinical symptoms of chronic hypothyroidism such as altered mentation, pericardial effusion, or heart failure; or those with very low levels of total thyroxine (T4) (eg, less than 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> or free T4 (eg, less than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate hypothyroidism</strong> &ndash; Includes all other patients with overt hypothyroidism (elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], low free T4) without the features of severe hypothyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild hypothyroidism</strong> &ndash; Includes patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, defined biochemically as a normal serum free T4 concentration in the presence of an elevated serum TSH concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies evaluating surgical outcomes in patients with subclinical or overt hypothyroidism generally show few adverse effects in patients with mild (subclinical) or moderate hypothyroidism, but adverse outcomes increase with the severity of hypothyroidism.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild (subclinical) hypothyroidism</strong> &ndash; There are few data on surgical outcomes in subclinical hypothyroid patients. In a prospective study comparing postoperative outcomes (after coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) in patients with known preoperative subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with normal free T4) and euthyroid patients, there were no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events or other outcomes (wound problems, mediastinitis, leg infection, respiratory complications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similar results were reported in a study of outcomes after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate overt hypothyroidism</strong> &ndash; Several studies have investigated the safety of general anesthesia and surgery in patients with untreated or inadequately treated hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. Surprisingly few adverse effects were reported, although the hypothyroid patients had a higher frequency of peri- and postoperative ileus, hypotension, hyponatremia, and central nervous system dysfunction than did the euthyroid patients. They also had less fever during serious infections and increased sensitivity to anesthesia and opiate pain medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One study investigated anesthetic and surgical outcomes in 59 hypothyroid patients and 59 paired euthyroid controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There were no differences between the groups in duration of surgery or anesthesia, lowest temperature and blood pressure recorded during surgery, need for vasopressors, time to extubation, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, incidence of arrhythmias, pulmonary and myocardial infarction, sepsis, need for postoperative respiratory assistance, bleeding complications, or time to hospital discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The second study investigated perioperative complications in 40 patients with mild to moderate hypothyroidism compared with 80 matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The hypothyroid patients had more intraoperative hypotension in noncardiac surgery and more heart failure in cardiac surgery. They also had more postoperative gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric complications and were less likely to mount a fever with infection. However, in this study, there were no differences in perioperative blood loss; duration of hospitalization; or the prevalences of perioperative arrhythmia, hypothermia, hyponatremia, delayed anesthetic recovery, abnormal tissue integrity, impaired wound healing, pulmonary complications, or death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe hypothyroidism</strong> &ndash; Older case studies in the anesthesia literature reported intraoperative hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, and extreme sensitivity to opioids, sedatives, and anesthesia in undiagnosed patients with more severe hypothyroidism, including myxedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In some case reports, myxedema coma is described as a rare postoperative complication in patients with unrecognized severe hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. This represents a medical emergency with a high mortality rate. The hallmarks of myxedema coma are decreased mental status and hypothermia, but hypotension, bradycardia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and hypoventilation are often present as well.

Generally, young patients are started on close to full replacement doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> (T4) (1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> daily), while older patients or patients with cardiopulmonary disease are started on 25 to 50 mcg daily with an increase in dose every two to six weeks.

If there is concern about existing or precipitating myxedema coma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54836\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54836 \">table 1</a>), we prefer to treat patients with both triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 to rapidly normalize thyroid function (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myxedema-coma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myxedema coma&quot;</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>T4 is given in a loading dose of 200 to 300 mcg intravenously (IV) followed by 50 mcg daily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>T3 is given simultaneously in a dose of 5 to 20 mcg IV followed by 2.5 to 10 mcg every eight hours depending upon the patient's age and coexistent cardiac risk factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Use of an arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter should be considered if cardiopulmonary disease exists.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Consider adrenal insufficiency</strong> &ndash; Rarely, Addison's disease will be present in a patient with primary hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In addition, patients with central (secondary) hypothyroidism may have inadequate pituitary adrenal reserve as euthyroidism is restored. If the status of the pituitary adrenal axis is uncertain and deficiency is considered likely, patients should be given stress doses of corticosteroids until the integrity of the axis is ascertained. If the clinical situation permits (ie, surgery can be delayed for an hour), a cosyntropin stimulation test should be performed prior to administering steroids. If the results of the cosyntropin test are normal, stress steroids are not needed and can be discontinued if already given.

In addition, a high index of suspicion for the development of an ileus, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and an infectious process without the presence of a fever is required.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hypothyroidism who are scheduled to undergo cardiovascular interventions or surgery require special consideration. The risk of precipitating or worsening unstable coronary syndromes with thyroid hormones conflicts with the concern that untreated hypothyroidism might worsen heart failure or hypotension in the cardiac surgical patient.</p><p>Retrospective and prospective studies of cardiac patients found no adverse outcomes in cardiac patients with mild to moderate hypothyroidism who had cardiac surgery or catheterization without thyroid replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>]. In a prospective study comparing postoperative outcomes in patients with known preoperative subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with normal free T4) and euthyroid patients, there were no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular events or other outcomes (wound problems, mediastinitis, leg infection, respiratory complications) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Angina is not an absolute contraindication to thyroid hormone replacement if the patient has symptomatic hypothyroidism. In patients with angina treated medically, the dose of T4 should begin with 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/day</span> and is increased 25 micrograms every two to six weeks, depending upon response. Presently, most patients with angina have coronary artery revascularization first, and T4 is prescribed afterwards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In most patients, angina has resolved after revascularization and before T4 has been prescribed, allowing the safe initial administration of a T4 dose that is approximately 50 to 75 percent of the full replacement dose based on body weight and adjusted four to six weeks later.

Patients who are seriously ill often have abnormal thyroid function tests that may or may not be clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These patients need to be distinguished from those who have clinically significant thyroid dysfunction. In general, thyroid function should not be assessed in seriously ill patients unless there is a strong suspicion of thyroid dysfunction. When thyroid dysfunction is suspected in critically ill patients, measurement of serum TSH alone is not appropriate for the evaluation of thyroid function. Instead, measurement of TSH, total T4, free T4, T3, and sometimes reverse T3 is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid function in nonthyroidal illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The changes in thyroid function during critical illness include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61095\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61095 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of hospitalized patients have a low serum T3 concentration.

Such patients should be treated with thyroid hormone as soon as the diagnosis is made. Generally, young patients are started on close to full replacement doses of T4 (1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg),</span> while older patients or patients with cardiopulmonary disease are started on 25 to 50 mcg daily with an increase in dose every two to six weeks.
