Recognizing that a person is entering the imminently dying or terminal phase of their illness is critical to appropriate care planning, with a shift to comfort care. Defining when this phase begins is not always straightforward. Patients at the end of life are frequently not recognized as dying. As a result, suffering may not be properly appreciated or managed, and the patient&rsquo;s overall condition may even be exacerbated by the continuation of standard medical care.</p><p>The modern hospice movement was established partly in response to the poor quality of care of the dying patient. Hospice is a health care delivery system under which support and services are provided to a patient with a terminal illness when curative or life-prolonging therapy is no longer indicated, and the focus is on comfort rather than cure. Hospice care focuses on the management of pain and other symptoms while addressing other forms of distress such as spiritual distress, psychosocial stressors, and existential angst. Given their excellence in care during the last days and hours of life, hospice programs can help individuals have a &ldquo;good death&rdquo; and lead to higher family satisfaction with the quality of care the patient receives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical specialty that focuses on preventing and relieving suffering as well as supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing serious illness.&nbsp;While all care that is delivered by hospice can be considered palliative care, not all palliative care delivered is in hospice. Palliative care can be appropriately offered to patients at any time along the trajectory of any type of serious life-threatening illness, even concurrent with restorative, life-prolonging therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite the benefits of palliative and hospice care, many patients in the terminal stages of a serious life-threatening illness die in settings where they do not receive care designed to address suffering in the last hours of life. Providing care to actively dying patients presents unique challenges for the clinician. Patients in their final days require careful symptom management, and families need support and coaching as death approaches. Care does not end with the death of the patient but continues through death pronouncement, family notification of the death, and bereavement support. </p><p>This topic review will cover management of patients with a terminal disease who are in the final days to hours of life. The comprehensive patient assessment and symptom assessment for palliative care patients, as well as an overview of managing pain and common non-pain symptoms in palliative care patients and issues surrounding stopping enteral and parenteral nutrition and hydration and ventilatory support are addressed in detail elsewhere.

Surveys indicate that most people would prefer to die at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In a systematic review of the international literature, preference for home death ranged from 59 to 81 percent in the general population, and from 49 to 91 percent among cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Dying at home has been associated with greater family satisfaction, better patient outcomes, a significantly higher &ldquo;quality of death&rdquo; as assessed by bereaved family members using a validated instrument, the &ldquo;Good Death Inventory&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and lower overall and financial caregiver burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>However, only approximately one-third of patients in the United States actually die at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], between 48 and 65 percent of all deaths occur in the hospital. Even in Ontario, Canada, where an End of Life Care Strategy was designed and implemented to shift care from acute settings to home, the proportion of hospital deaths remained the same, 38 percent, prior to and one year after implementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Hospitals and nursing homes are settings where a comfort care approach, such as used in home hospice, may not be routinely available, and suffering in the last hours of life may not be addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Death in a hospital, compared with death at home, is associated with more physical and emotional distress, worse quality of life at the end of life, and more prolonged grief disorder among caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. A high rate (20 percent) of burdensome transitions between home, hospital, and nursing home during the last days and weeks of life has been documented for nursing home residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Recognizing that a patient is dying before his or her last week of life and earlier referral to palliative care may be associated with fewer deaths in hospital and more deaths in a preferred place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Patients enrolled in hospice programs are also less likely to die in the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Utilization of hospice programs has increased over time, and as of 2014, the latest year for which statistics are available, the location of hospice patients at the time of death was a private residence in 36 percent, a nursing home in 15 percent, a residential facility in 9 percent, a hospice inpatient facility in 32 percent, and an acute care hospital in only 9.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>However, late recognition of dying can result in late hospice referral and more intensive care unit (ICU) use at the end of life. This was shown in a study of 848,303 fee-for-service Medicare recipients who died in 2000, 2005, and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although hospice use at the time of death increased from 22 to 42 percent between 2000 and 2009, 28 percent of those dying with hospice in 2009 used hospice for three days or less. Of these late hospice referrals, 40 percent were preceded by hospitalization with an ICU stay. </p><p>Other factors might be operative. An interesting association between immigrant status and aggressiveness of care at the end of life was noted in a population-based study from Ontario that examined location of death and intensity of care received in the last six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Compared with longstanding residents of Ontario, recent immigrant decedents were significantly more likely to die in an ICU (15.6 versus 10 percent) after adjusting for differences in age, sex, income, geography, and cause of death (relative risk 1.3, 95% CI 1.27-1.32). Rates of ICU death varied among different nationalities but were greatest in Southern Asians and lowest in Western and Northern Europeans. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms for this association, but they may relate to challenges in health literacy, cultural preferences, and communication barriers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109678384\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATING SHORT-TERM PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Providing a relatively accurate prognosis of life expectancy for patients with an advanced life-threatening illness has become increasingly difficult, in part due to the development of new therapies with variable effectiveness. In addition, perhaps for psychological reasons and the desire to maintain hope, clinicians&rsquo; prognoses are usually overly optimistic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, accurate prognostication is important for patients, families and health care providers to have realistic expectations so they can have the opportunity to plan for care at life's end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Late recognition of dying results in poor symptom management and suboptimal psychosocial and spiritual care for dying patients and their families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>A variety of tools have been developed to aid clinicians in prognostic assessment, and in some cases, to determine eligibility for hospice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states#H355801997\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States&quot;, section on 'Who is a candidate for hospice?'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-of-prognosis-in-palliative-care#H11773296\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication of prognosis in palliative care&quot;, section on 'The science of estimating prognosis'</a>.) </p><p>Particularly for patients with cancer, several tools have been developed that can predict the probability of survival at time points that are as short as 7 to 15 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-35</a>]. Some models are applicable to non-cancer diagnoses as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In general, the accuracy of clinical predictions of life expectancy is higher when the clinical prediction of survival is shorter (&le;3 weeks) rather than longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Integrated prognostic models to estimate the length of remaining life in cancer patients are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=survival-estimates-in-advanced-terminal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Survival estimates in advanced terminal cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The limitations of tools such as these can be illustrated by a study that examined data from two prospectively collected databases, SUPPORT (Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments) and APACHE III (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In SUPPORT, the median predicted chance of two-month survival on the day before actual death was 17 percent, and was 51 percent seven days before death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104832532\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosing dying</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The identification of individuals with a terminal illness who are actively dying (life expectancy measured in hours to days) may be straightforward at times, but also can be difficult. Diagnosing dying in patients with heart failure is particularly challenging and is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-of-prognosis-in-palliative-care#H11773296\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication of prognosis in palliative care&quot;, section on 'The science of estimating prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-for-patients-with-advanced-heart-failure-indications-and-strategies#H1818450715\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care for patients with advanced heart failure: Indications and strategies&quot;, section on 'Estimating prognosis'</a>.) </p><p>Among the barriers to diagnosing &ldquo;dying&rdquo; are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hope that the patient may get better</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disagreement about the patient&rsquo;s overall condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to recognize key symptoms and signs</p><p/><p>These barriers can be overcome by continuous reevaluation of the clinical condition, close communication and sharing of information between caregivers and family members, and paying close attention to certain signs, particularly functional decline, that tend to be present when patients are within days of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. </p><p>There are various patterns of death trajectory at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, with the exception of precipitous, unexpected fatal events (eg, massive hemorrhage), certain signs tend to be present (eg, sleepiness, diminished consciousness, loss of interest in eating and drinking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F88520\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88520 \">table 1</a>)) when patients are actively dying that are applicable to a variety of conditions.

The frequency and median onset of each sign from the time of death was used to calculate the likelihood ratio (LR; ie, how many times more or less likely patients who died within three days were to have the physical sign compared with those who did not die). Five of the signs that emerged mostly during the last three days of life had both high specificity (ie, &gt;95 percent chance that the patient would not die within three days if the symptom was absent) and high positive LRs, including pulselessness of the radial artery (positive LR 15.6, 95% CI 13.7-17.4); respiration with mandibular movement (positive LR 10, 95% CI 9.1-10.9); decreased urine output (positive LR 15.2, 95% CI 13.4-17.1); Cheyne-Stoke breathing (positive LR 12.4, 95% CI 10.8-13.9), and death rattle (positive LR 9, 95% CI 8.1-9.8). However, sensitivity was limited; these signs were present in fewer than 27 percent of the patients who died. Thus, clinicians and families cannot rely on vital signs alone to rule in or rule out impending death, and routine monitoring of the vital signs in patients who are imminently dying cannot be recommended. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a later analysis, these same investigators identified eight additional clinical bedside signs that were highly specific for impending death within three days and had a high positive LR of &gt;5: nonreactive pupils (LR 16.7, 95% CI 14.9-18.6), decreased response to verbal stimuli (LR 8.3, 95% CI 7.7-9), decreased response to visual stimuli (LR 6.7, 95% CI 6.3-7.1), inability to close eyelids (LR 13.6, 95% CI 11.7-15.5), drooping of the nasolabial fold (LR 8.3, 95% CI 7.7-8.9), hyperextension of the neck (LR 7.3, 95% CI 6.7-8), grunting of the vocal cords (LR 11.8, 95% CI 10.3-13.4), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (LR 10.3, 95% CI 9.5-11.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Among the issues that are important to resolve, if not previously discussed, are preferences for location of care and for limits on invasive or aggressive resuscitative therapies that often are ineffective in a patient with end stage disease.

While CPR can be successful in prolonging life in selected patients, it will not reverse a terminal illness. Patients who are in the actively dying phase should not be subjected to CPR, as this constitutes a non-beneficial and potentially harmful medical treatment. Nonetheless, it may be an intervention that is expected by patients and their families, and as such, it should be addressed through proactive communication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and outcomes following sudden cardiac arrest in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-issues-in-the-intensive-care-unit-in-adults#H5572269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Issues in the intensive care unit in adults&quot;, section on 'CPR and families bearing witness'</a>.) </p><p>Discussions about CPR tend to take place late in the course of disease, and particularly acute care hospitals, many patients, even those declining with a known terminal illness, have a do not resuscitate (DNR) order written only within the last 24 hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. This is not optimal. Failure to address CPR earlier in the course of illness may force the discussion to take place during a crisis, or oblige emergency services personnel to attempt resuscitation, if called when the patient dies. Furthermore, having a DNR order can facilitate comfort care interventions (including optimizing management of pain in the dying patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]) and minimize the use of unhelpful invasive tests and treatments. Most <span class=\"nowrap\">hospice/home</span> palliative care programs have policies requiring that expectations around CPR be addressed prior to enrollment, although not all programs require that a patient have a DNR order to be eligible for <span class=\"nowrap\">hospice/palliative</span> care services. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194020310\"><span class=\"h2\">Venue of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The venue of care for dying patients should be individualized, based both on clinical considerations and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> preferences. Hospitalized patients who are actively dying should be moved into a private room or setting that will allow maximal family access and privacy, as well as attentive nursing support for symptom management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194020317\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients dying in the ICU</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional goals of intensive care unit (ICU) care are to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with critical illness, maintain organ function, and restore health. Despite technological advances, death in the ICU is common. When the acute illness or accompanying organ dysfunction is refractory to treatment, or the goals of care can no longer be met, or when the provision of life support is likely to result in outcomes that are not congruent with patient values and preferences, ICU clinicians must ensure that patients die with dignity.</p><p>Although palliative care can be delivered successfully to patients who are in the ICU, there are some challenges inherent in caring for dying patients in the ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In the acute care environment, the focus has traditionally been on curing and prolonging life, and there can be tensions inherent in moving care toward a symptom management model such as palliative care. Furthermore, the general environment of the ICU, with continual monitoring of vital signs, instrumentation, environmental noise, lights, sleep deprivation, and limited family access, detracts from comfort. However, competing preferences for a nontechnologic death and for patients to receive all treatments that maximize the chance of surviving an acute episode must be balanced, and this may require management in the ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Decisions on whether to continue ICU care or not must be individualized. If appropriate, however, transfer out of the ICU setting is desirable unless the patient is so unstable that death could occur very quickly, in which case it may be better to liberalize visitation and allow support of the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> there.</p><p>Efforts have been increasing to improve symptom management and provide dignity-conserving care for actively dying patients in the ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. As an example, a paradigm to assist in the delivery of palliative care to patients dying in the ICU has been developed that is termed the &ldquo;ABCDs (attitudes, behaviors, compassion, and dialogue) of dignity-conserving care&rdquo;, examples of which are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F96061\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96061 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

However, patients who are unstable and are likely to die in transport or very shortly afterward should be considered on a case by case basis. It is important in such situations that the patient and family understand the likely outcome and be both physical, emotionally, and practically equipped for caring for an actively dying patient. Although home hospices can assist patients who are actively dying at the time of admission and have been referred late, it is preferable to refer patients for home hospice as early as possible so that they may receive the full benefits of home hospice referral, which include developing a therapeutic relationship between patient and clinical caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/25,26,48,49,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,48,49,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1203884180\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple physiologic changes that occur in the last hours and days of life, and these are generally accompanied by functional decline and a variety of symptoms, the most common of which are dyspnea, delirium, anxiety, noisy respiratory secretions, worsening pain, and nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/52,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,63</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1203884312\"><span class=\"h2\">Weakness, fatigue, and functional decline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing overall burden of disease and diminishing functional reserve results in weakness and fatigue, a decreased tolerance for physical activity, and a decline in the activities of daily living. Patients may no longer be able to climb stairs in order to access a bedroom or toilet. Options include creating space for care on an accessible level or providing a portable toilet (commode) near the bed, or having a urinal or bedpan available. </p><p>One of the most significant milestones of functional decline is loss of the ability to independently transfer. The transition period between independent mobility and bed confinement is a high-risk period for falls. Assistive equipment may be needed. In the inpatient setting, encouraging and allowing family to stay with the patient may be comforting and promote safety. Call buttons and bed alarms may help staff respond to patients&rsquo; needs promptly so that falls can be avoided. In some patients, one-to-one sitters may be needed and should be considered with restraints being a choice of last resort.</p><p>Continuous pressure on the same area of skin, particularly over bony prominences, will increase the risk of skin ischemia and pain. Providing adequate cushioning on the bed will improve comfort if turning and repositioning are uncomfortable.</p><p>Aspects of personal hygiene such as bathing or help with toileting may be socially uncomfortable for some family members to provide while supporting the patient at home. Such concerns should be understood and accommodated by the care team. </p><p>In the home, a home health aide is a major resource to the patient and family in assisting with these tasks. However, even if a home health care is available, family members should still be educated regarding transfers, turning, changing, feeding, and other personal care issues in order to ensure safety. Many providers assume families know how to provide personal care and many family members want to provide some or even most personal care in the home and assist in the inpatient settings. However, basic instruction and a culture of permission to participate are important to foster.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1203884320\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased oral intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The great majority of patients in the terminal phase of an advanced illness experience reduced oral intake before death. Impaired swallowing is a common development in advanced terminal illness. It may develop as part of profound generalized weakness where the inability to take in food and fluids parallels the overall physiologic decline in the final days, or be due to potentially reversible sedation due to medications, or metabolic disturbances such as hypercalcemia. </p><p>Family members and caregivers often experience high levels of emotional distress when a terminally ill patient becomes unable to take food and fluids orally. For patients in the final days or weeks of advanced terminal illness, there is no evidence that improving caloric intake will improve strength, energy, or functional status, nor prolong survival. Neither parenteral nutrition nor tube feeding is recommended for nutritional support of patients in the dying phase of an advanced terminal illness. However, food and eating have emotional connotations, and families may feel helpless as they witness ongoing weakness and weight loss when food intake is poor. Sometimes this is expressed as concerns of &ldquo;starving.&rdquo; Clinicians should anticipate this concern by bringing up the subject. &ldquo;I am sure you are concerned that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is not eating or drinking much.&rdquo; This allows the clinician to provide family education and counseling on the normal dying process. Acknowledging concerns and reframing the situation by reviewing the decline in intake in the context of the advanced illness is usually helpful. Provision of information in a culturally sensitive way reduces distress over this issue and potential conflicts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer#H21016357\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'End of life and cancer'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life#H691577442\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stopping nutrition and hydration at the end of life&quot;, section on 'Artificial nutrition'</a>.)</p><p>The possibility that dehydration may contribute to suffering and hasten death in patients at the end of life has generated strong debate with arguments for and against parenteral fluid administration. Case-based reports, retrospective series, and testimony from hospice professionals support the view that dehydration in terminally ill patients is associated with amelioration of symptoms (eg, relief from choking and drowning sensations, less coughing and chest congestion, decreased urine output with less need for catheterization and bedwetting, decreased GI fluid with less vomiting, bloating, and diarrhea, less peripheral edema, less pain), diminished appetite, no thirst, and a comfortable death. In particular, good mouth care provides a useful intervention for caregivers and family members to do for their loved one to improve symptoms of thirst and mouth irritation. Furthermore, a randomized trial of 129 hospice patients with cancer who were randomly assigned to parenteral hydration (one liter of normal saline over four hours daily) or placebo (100 mL per day) to determine whether parenteral hydration was superior to placebo in improving symptoms of dehydration, delaying onset or severity of delirium, and had any effect on quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. There was no difference between treatment and control groups in dehydration symptoms (a composite score of fatigue, myoclonus, sedation, and hallucinations) at day four, quality of life at day seven, or survival. The issues surrounding hydration in palliative care patients is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life#H691578713\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stopping nutrition and hydration at the end of life&quot;, section on 'Artificial hydration'</a>.) </p><p>Ensuring timely access to needed medications is a fundamental component of care at the end of life. Non-oral routes of drug administration may be needed for patients who are unable to take medications by mouth. (See <a href=\"#H194021162\" class=\"local\">'Route of medication administration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25377120\"><span class=\"h2\">Diminished blood perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decrease in cardiac output and intravascular volume leads to diminished peripheral perfusion. Tachycardia, hypotension, peripheral cooling, peripheral and central cyanosis, mottling of the skin, and loss of peripheral pulses are common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25377140\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neurologic changes associated with the dying process may manifest themselves in two different ways: decreasing levels of consciousness leading to coma and death, or a terminal delirium, presenting as confusion, restlessness, agitation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> day-night reversal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/52,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,65</a>]. Moaning, groaning, and grimacing may accompany the agitation and restlessness, and may be misinterpreted as physical pain. A hypoactive form of delirium may occur with less psychomotor activity. Delirium can be distressing to family members and interpreted as a &ldquo;horrible death with uncontrolled pain&rdquo; unless it is recognized and treated appropriately.</p><p>Numerous medications may cause delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Some of these may be needed at the end of life to treat symptoms (eg, opioids, benzodiazepines, glucocorticoids, neuroleptics, and medications to manage secretions). In some cases, a change to a different drug in the same class might alleviate delirium, but in other cases, if use of the drug is considered optimal for symptom control, the resulting delirium can still be treated. (See <a href=\"#H116056370\" class=\"local\">'Delirium'</a> below.) </p><p>Withdrawal from certain medications (opioids, benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], alcohol) may also contribute to delirium. Delirium may be related to medications that are not clearly needed or for which the burden is greater than the therapeutic effect (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>). The benefits and burdens of all medications should be carefully considered, and those medications that are considered nonessential should be discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H109678419\" class=\"local\">'Reviewing medication orders'</a> below.) </p><p>A less common cause of potentially reversible altered mental status is nonconvulsive status epilepticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Changes in the breathing pattern may indicate significant neurologic compromise and impending death. Breaths may become shallow and frequent with a diminishing tidal volume. Periods of apnea or a Cheyne-Stokes pattern of respirations (which is characterized by cyclic crescendo-decrescendo respiratory effort and airflow during wakefulness or sleep, without upper airway obstruction) may develop. This may be perceived by family members as breathlessness, or impending suffocation. Therefore, similar to other anticipated changes at the end of life, this should be discussed with the family early on. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disordered-breathing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194019043\"><span class=\"h2\">Accumulation of upper airway secretions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of the ability to swallow may result from weakness and decreased neurologic function. The gag reflex and reflexive clearing of the oropharynx decline, and secretions from the tracheobronchial tree accumulate. The buildup of saliva and oropharyngeal secretions may lead to gurgling, crackling, or rattling sounds with each breath, which some refer to as the &ldquo;death rattle.&rdquo; Increased airway secretions may interfere with a patient&rsquo;s ability to sleep, worsen dyspnea, precipitate uncomfortable coughing spells, and predispose to infections. In addition, in the last stages of life, gurgling and crackling sounds that result from increased secretions can be distressing to the family. </p><p>In addition to a health care professional explaining and reassuring the patient&rsquo;s family, proper positioning, and encouraging the family to cleanse the mouth with sponge sticks can be helpful. Some patients (eg, those with advanced head and neck cancer) may benefit from suctioning to clear excessive secretions if they have a lot of drooling. However, deep suctioning should be avoided. Evidence for the use of hyoscine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> to minimize secretions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F81557\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81557 \">table 4</a>) is scant. Furthermore, premature use of any anticholinergic agents in the patient who is still alert may result in uncomfortable drying of the oral and pharyngeal mucosae.

A urinary catheter may minimize the need for frequent changing and cleaning, and reduce demand on caregivers. However, catheters can be viewed as a form of restraint, and their use should be carefully considered. Use of a catheter may not be necessary if urine flow is minimal and can be managed with absorbent pads. </p><p>In older men, urinary retention from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may be exacerbated by the use of medications with anticholinergic effects, and use of a catheter may prevent pain and distress. Ultrasound bladder scanners may be used by nursing staff to determine if urinary retention is present, thus avoiding the use of an &ldquo;in and out&rdquo; catheterization.</p><p>Profuse intractable diarrhea may be managed with a rectal tube, although this is rarely necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194019120\"><span class=\"h2\">Inability to close eyes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cachexia leads to loss of the retroorbital fat pad, causing the orbit to fall posteriorly within its socket.

The earliest and most well-known and widely used of the end of life care ICPs is the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>] which was designed to guide the treatment of patients in the last 48 hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. The LCP is divided into three sections: initial assessment, ongoing care, and care after death, with physical, psychosocial, and spiritual care contained in each section. Once a patient is entered into the pathway, timed reviews are conducted of the patient&rsquo;s comfort and documentation of any problems and the actions taken. Medications for the five most common symptoms arising in the last hours of life are prescribed in advance so that they will be immediately available if required. </p><p>Although popular and widely used in Great Britain and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/76-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-79</a>], the available data do not support benefit for this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/28,80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,80,81</a>].

The final population comprised 308 patients who died from cancer and their families. The trial&rsquo;s primary endpoint, the overall quality of care toolkit score, is a validated interview-based tool to measure the quality of care at the end of life from the perspective of family members and consists of 33 open-ended questions focused on the patient&rsquo;s time spent on the ward. Although there were some benefits in the overall control of breathlessness and in scores for respect, dignity, and kindness that favored the LCP, there was no significant difference noted between patients who died in wards in which the LCP had been implemented, compared with those in which it was not, as judged by the overall quality of care toolkit scores (scores 70.5 versus 63 on a scale of 0 to 100, cluster adjusted mean difference 7.6, 95% CI -3.6 to 18.7). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefit could also not be shown in a before-after Dutch study included 311 cancer patients who died in a hospital, nursing home, or home over a three-year period of time; the LCP was introduced approximately halfway through the study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Within a week of the death, the patient&rsquo;s physician was given a questionnaire about medication use during the last three days of life. Approximately three months after the death, the relative who had been the contact person for the patient was asked to complete a questionnaire about the patient&rsquo;s symptom levels in the last three days of life. There were no reported differences in symptoms in the last three days of life before and after introduction of the LCP, and use of the LCP had no significant impact on the types of drugs that were used during the last three days of life in most cases. </p><p/><p>In addition to the lack of demonstrated benefit, the LCP has generated controversy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective use of the LCP depends on clinicians being able to identify individuals approaching the last 48 hours of life. However, even experienced clinicians can find it difficult to decide when death is imminent, particularly for patients with a non-cancer illness.

In fact, some patients improve after all disease modifying treatments have been withdrawn, and it may be appropriate to discontinue the pathway in such cases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A national audit of National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in Great Britain in 2012 revealed that approximately one-half of patients on the LCP were not aware that they had even been placed on the pathway, suggesting that lack of communication was a major concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p/><p>Largely based upon these concerns, a year-long review in 2013 commissioned by the British National Health Service recommended that the LCP be abolished in favor of individual care plans for the dying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. </p><p>Alternative end of life care pathways have been developed and implemented in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/53,86-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,86-89</a>] and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>] that are intended to be <span class=\"nowrap\">utilized/supervised</span> by higher level providers. As an example, our group has developed a set of comfort care plans (referred to as a Comfort Care Order Set [CCOS]) based upon the best practices for care in the last hours or days of life as practiced in the home hospice setting and modified for use in the acute care inpatient setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

Ongoing support for symptom management protocols is required to achieve culture change in an institution. Audit and feedback, as well as other quality improvement techniques will be required to ensure optimal uptake of the symptom management protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. One important issue is to accommodate the desire to continue some disease modifying treatments, especially earlier in the dying process. Providers will be more comfortable initiating the symptom management protocol if there are no requirements to stop other treatment plans.

The majority reported baseline and post-implementation pathway chart audit information while a smaller number were local, national, or international benchmarking studies. Few studies included a control group, or collected contemporaneous data; only one study matched the groups, and almost none controlled for confounders, leading to uncertainty as to whether the ICP itself was actually driving improvements in care of the dying. The majority of the chart audits included small sample sizes. Overall, however, the available data support the premise that use of ICPs promotes better care at the end of life, but the absence of randomized trials precludes definitive recommendations. </p><p>Benefits from use of the CCOS developed by our group (which is available at the <a href=\"http://www.uab.edu/medicine/palliativecare/training/beacon&amp;token=NfZMdQpGEPIEQFGurVskTdtb6lfJ/Yv+EuSAIXGiIwUXwhA7A0xRjfW/yobHb+SZgYuAi8TrTMivjrvHZHe2Xg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14241\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">UAB BEACON Project</a> website) were addressed in a multi-site implementation trial using a stepped wedge design in which the intervention was initiated sequentially between 2005 and 2011 in six urban tertiary care US Veterans Affairs Medical Centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Data were abstracted from the computerized medical records of 6066 veterans dying in a 12 month period before (n = 3243) and after (n = 2824) implementation of the order set. Following the implementation of the order set, orders for opioid medication increased significantly from 62 to 73 percent (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% CI 1.09-1.76), significantly more patients had palliative care consultations (31 versus 17 percent), and there were significantly more orders for antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, death rattle medications, and sublingual drug administration. There were also significantly more advance directives (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.15-1.88) and significantly fewer nasogastric tubes (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.96) at the time of death. However, the intervention did not significantly decrease the proportion of deaths occurring in intensive care units (41 versus 37 percent), the proportion of deaths in which there was a &ldquo;do not resuscitate&rdquo; order (70 versus 75 percent), or the use of restraints at the time of death (16 versus 13 percent).</p><p>Benefits of another standardized palliative care order set on end of life care were addressed in a retrospective chart review of all patients who died at one community teaching hospital over a six month period, starting eight months after implementation of the order set [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Of the 106 patients who died after a hospital stay of more than two days, 31 (29 percent) were treated using the palliative care order set, 6 (6 percent) received only a &ldquo;Comfort Measures Only&rdquo; (CMO) order, and 69 (65 percent) received neither. Patients who were managed using the palliative care order set had significantly more orders for every palliative medication, every patient had access to opioids and anxiolytics at the time of death, and most patients had orders for antiemetic, antipsychotic, anticholinergic, and laxative medication. In contrast, very few of the patients in the &ldquo;no palliative care orders&rdquo; group received orders for these medications. In addition, while the palliative care order set and CMO patients had limited non-palliative interventions, the non-palliative group had relatively high use of non-palliative medications and interventions (eg, vasopressors, antibiotics, anticoagulants, finger stick and laboratory blood tests, blood products, intravenous (IV) fluids and artificial nutrition) until death.</p><p>Taken together, the existing data demonstrate improved processes of care at the end of life when ICPs are implemented in patients who are actively dying. However, care of the dying is complex and guidelines must be customized for patients. Furthermore, successful implementation of ICPs requires training of all providers in the proper application of the guidelines, with readily available physician support and ongoing review with quality improvement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194021519\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109678419\"><span class=\"h3\">Reviewing medication orders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polypharmacy is common in patients at the end of life, and presents a burden for many [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. Furthermore, many of these drugs (especially preventative medication) no longer provide therapeutic benefit, and polypharmacy increases the possibility of drug-drug interactions and adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>]. </p><p>Nonessential and potentially inappropriate medications are commonly prescribed to actively dying patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. These nonessential drugs that are no longer consistent with the overall care plan should be discontinued, if possible (particularly those being administered for primary and secondary prevention) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/40,53-55,99-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,53-55,99-106</a>]. Antihypertensives can usually be discontinued, as hypertension is usually not an issue with ongoing weight loss and diminishing fluid intake. Continuation of medications for angina or heart failure should be guided by clinical assessment of need; poor control of these conditions may adversely impact quality of life during the final weeks, although unlikely in the final days.</p><p>Management of patients with diabetes at the end of life must be tailored to the individual patient&rsquo;s needs and the severity of the illness. In general, the risks and consequences of hypoglycemia are greater than those of hyperglycemia in patients at the end of life; looser control of blood sugars is appropriate. If at all possible, sliding scale insulin, which requires painful finger sticks to assess blood sugars, should be avoided. </p><p>Anticonvulsants are generally maintained; however, the need for the initial prescription should be scrutinized; ongoing treatment may not be needed if the anticonvulsant was started for neuropathic pain or seizure prophylaxis. If the patient has a documented seizure disorder, it is imperative that an alternative route of such as <span class=\"nowrap\">IV/subcutaneous</span> (SC) for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> per rectum be instituted if and when the oral route is lost to prevent recurrence of seizures.</p><p>Most medications can be stopped abruptly; however, certain medications should be gradually stopped (tapered) to prevent complications.

Patients may not be able to take medications by mouth, and non-oral routes must be considered. Removal of existing central venous access devices or gastrostomy tubes should be carefully considered, as they may represent a very effective means of administered medications if the oral route is no longer feasible. On the other hand, if the gastrostomy tube is dislodged or IV access is lost, being able to continue medication with minimal interruption and discomfort is important. For this reason, we prefer the SC route for most patients as it is safe, broadly feasible, and fairly nonburdensome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194021184\"><span class=\"h4\">Choosing between non-oral routes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a wide variety of non-oral routes for medication administration, which differ in their availability across care settings, acceptance by the patient and family, and in the specific drugs that can be administered by that route. In general, the least invasive route of administration should be chosen. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrostomy tube</strong> &ndash; If already in place, a gastrostomy tube is a convenient and well-tolerated means of administering medication. Many medications are available in liquid form, and some tablets can be crushed (but not long-acting formulations of opioids, and some enteric coated medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subcutaneous </strong>&ndash; A wide variety of medications can be administered SC using the parenteral formulation, either intermittently or by continuous infusion using a syringe driver. A site in the abdominal wall is preferred over an extremity site because there is a larger space for fluids to disperse, and peripheral absorption is less dependable as perfusion declines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Continuous SC infusional drug administration has not been widely adopted in United States acute care hospitals, but it may be more widely used, especially for administration of analgesics, by home hospice units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/109-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">109-112</a>].

Although many essential drugs, including opioids, anxiolytics, and antiemetics, can be converted to the SC route, SC options for some medications, such as anticonvulsants, are limited. Oral to SC equivalences for opioids are variable depending on the specific agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111206 \">table 6</a>).

We would generally stop these medications, and offer on a &ldquo;may refuse&rdquo; basis (or based on pain assessment for the non-verbal patient) a dose of short-acting morphine or opioids every two hours, as a scheduled medicine that the nurse or family should assess to provide, but not administer if not needed.</p><p>For most people dying of illnesses other than cancer who have pain or dyspnea but have received little to no opioids, a starting dose of 5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> sulfate orally or sublingually or 2 mg morphine sulfate SC every two hours (offer, may refuse; or PRN) is a reasonable starting point.

If a patient accepts every dose or still seems to be in pain, then increasing the dose or even starting a morphine infusion may be needed. For patients who have been on chronic opioids, higher doses will likely be needed. A reasonable starting point for an &ldquo;as needed&rdquo; dose is 10 to 15 percent of the basal daily requirement of opioid, calculated in morphine equivalents, and offered every two hours on an &ldquo;offer; may refuse&rdquo; basis.</p><p>In general, we do not recommend intermittent IV dosing of opioids, even if an indwelling central venous line is available, since the <span class=\"nowrap\">half/life</span> is very short and continuous infusion is often needed.

The use of supplemental oxygen should ideally be restricted to dyspneic patients who are hypoxemic.

Since measurement of oxygen saturation is not routinely done in the home hospice setting, a therapeutic trial of oxygen is not unreasonable for dyspneic patients.

Palliative sedation may also be considered for acute symptoms that are of sufficient severity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trajectory as to require prompt intervention to relieve distress in patients who are actively dying (death expected in hours to days). Cases where acute distressing events might occur include massive bleeding, grand mal seizures, or acute airway obstruction; refractory symptoms that may require the use of palliative sedation include nausea, agitated delirium, pain, or refractory dyspnea. Further discussion on palliative sedation is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-sedation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative sedation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2384748686\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of antimicrobials at the end of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections and febrile episodes are among the most common acute complications experienced by terminally ill patients, and they may represent a terminal event. Antimicrobials are commonly prescribed to dying patients in the absence of clinical symptoms to support bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/145,146\" class=\"abstract_t\">145,146</a>]. Close to 90 percent of hospitalized patients with advanced cancer, 42 percent of nursing home residents with advanced dementia, and approximately one-fourth of hospice recipients, for whom the intended goal of care is comfort, receive antimicrobials during the final weeks of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/145,147-149\" class=\"abstract_t\">145,147-149</a>].</p><p>Potential benefits such as prolongation of survival <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptom relief may motivate the prescribing of antimicrobials to terminally ill patients. However, the available evidence to support either benefit is sparse; no randomized trials have examined these outcomes in palliative care populations. A systematic review of eight observational studies assessed symptoms after antimicrobial therapy in patients receiving hospice or palliative care; however, there was no comparison group of untreated patients, and this and other methodologic difficulties precluded an assessment of symptom relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. A prospective (but not randomized) study noted longer survival but not greater comfort in patients with advanced dementia and suspected pneumonia who were treated with antimicrobials compared with those who were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. There are also no clear studies of adverse effects of prescribing antimicrobials in this population. Possible adverse consequences include adverse reactions, drug-drug interactions, infection with <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, the acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms (an increasing public health concern), and the burden imposed by evaluation and treatment of suspected infections at the end of life.</p><p>To the extent possible, decision making about antimicrobial use at end of life should be undertaken as a component of advance care planning, and treatment preferences documented in advance directives, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> while discussing goals of care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, in the absence of advance directives, the decision to pursue or not pursue antimicrobials at the end of life must be individualized, and the approach taken should align with the patient&rsquo;s stated goals of care. The risks and burdens of evaluating and treating an infection should be discussed, along with the possible benefits, while acknowledging the lack of high-quality outcomes data. If the patient&rsquo;s goal is to live as long as possible or to live to a specific date (a life event like a graduation, birth of a child, etc), and the potential benefits of antimicrobial use are felt to outweighs its burdens, a clinical assessment for suspected infection, with administration of antimicrobials by the least invasive route, is reasonable if there is adequate evidence to support a bacterial infection.

Consider a full liquid diet since it is more palatable (contains ice cream, sherbet, and jello) and easier to swallow than a clear liquid diet.

If hospice is involved, the family should be directed to call the hospice, and a nurse will generally come to the home and pronounce the patient. A local coroner may investigate any death and may perform an autopsy, but generally will not become involved when the death was expected and was managed by a hospice.</p><p>Different procedures are used in other countries. </p><p>For patients who die in the hospital, the covering physician is generally summoned to pronounce the patient. The family should be notified, if they are not present, and if appropriate, can be approached about autopsy or organ donation.

Recognizing that a person is entering the dying or terminal phase of their illness is critical to appropriate care planning, with a shift to comfort care. (See <a href=\"#H109678377\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the benefits of palliative and hospice care, many patients in the terminal stages of a serious life-threatening illness die in settings where they do not receive care designed to address suffering in the last hours of life. Recognizing that a patient is dying before his or her last week of life is associated with fewer deaths in the hospital and more deaths in a preferred place. Patients enrolled in hospice programs are also less likely to die in the hospital. (See <a href=\"#H1024055982\" class=\"local\">'Place of death'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the exception of patients who have a precipitous, unexpected fatal event (eg, massive hemorrhage), certain signs are usually present when patients are within days of death. A checklist for identifying actively dying patients is presented in a table, and is applicable to a variety of clinical conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F88520\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88520 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H109678384\" class=\"local\">'Estimating short-term prognosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H104832532\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosing dying'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a patient has begun the transition to the actively dying phase, the goals of care should shift toward maintaining physical comfort, and alleviating emotional, spiritual, and social distress for the patient and family. Among the issues that are important to resolve are preferences for location of care and preferences for limits on invasive or aggressive resuscitative therapies that often are ineffective in a patient with end stage disease. (See <a href=\"#H194020262\" class=\"local\">'Honoring preferences for end of life care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discussions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are of vital importance for patients with a terminal illness, and preferably these discussions should take place prior to the active dying phase. For patients who are actively dying from a terminal illness, CPR constitutes a non-beneficial or harmful and inappropriate medical treatment. Nonetheless, it may be an intervention that is expected by patients and their families, and as such, it should be addressed through proactive communication. (See <a href=\"#H194020269\" class=\"local\">'Discussions around cardiopulmonary resuscitation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care can be delivered to patients who are dying in the intensive care unit (ICU), although there are inherent challenges. Efforts have been increasing to improve symptom management and provide dignity-conserving care for actively dying patients in the ICU. (See <a href=\"#H194020317\" class=\"local\">'Patients dying in the ICU'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a variety of physiologic changes that occur in the last hours and days of life, and these are generally accompanied by functional decline and a variety of symptoms, the most common of which are dyspnea, nausea, delirium, anxiety, and noisy respiratory secretions. (See <a href=\"#H1203884180\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic changes and symptoms'</a> above.) An end of life integrated care pathway such as a comfort care order set may optimize management in dying patients. (See <a href=\"#H1024055617\" class=\"local\">'Integrated care pathways'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonessential drugs that are no longer consistent with the overall care plan should be discontinued, if possible. &ldquo;As required&rdquo; drugs for common symptoms (including pain, dyspnea, nausea, delirium, anxiety, and noisy respiratory secretions) should be prescribed. This ensures that needed medications are available for comfort care at any time, without delay in obtaining an order. (See <a href=\"#H194021020\" class=\"local\">'Management of specific symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nursing care for the actively dying should be redirected from uncomfortable procedures and unnecessary monitoring to an emphasis on assisting the patient's physical comfort while offering emotional and practical support to the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span>.
