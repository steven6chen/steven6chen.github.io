Optimal deceased donors are generally young, previously healthy persons who develop a fatal brain injury due to causes such as head trauma, intracerebral hemorrhage, or anoxia. The relative paucity of donor organs has led transplant centers to consider organs from marginal donors.</p><p>This topic will review the selection process for deceased donors and examine donor characteristics associated with recipient outcomes. Patient selection for liver transplantation, living donor liver transplantation, and ethical issues in liver transplantation are discussed elsewhere.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-patient-selection-and-pretransplantation-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=living-donor-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Living donor liver transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in liver transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Donation after brain death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) provides minimum guidelines for organ procurement. The initial evaluation is typically performed by the local organ procurement organization (OPO). The OPO representative verifies that the prospective donor meets the criteria for brain death. Consent for donation is obtained from the potential donor's next of kin. ABO blood type, height, weight, and chest circumference are obtained because recipient matching is based upon blood type and donor organ size.</p><p>Potential donors with contraindications to donation are excluded. These include non-hepatic malignancy (other than primary brain tumor without ventriculoperitoneal shunt). Previously, anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity was an absolute contraindication to donation in the United States. The ban was in part due to concern that transplanting HIV-positive organs into patients with HIV that was well controlled could result in the transfer of resistant HIV to the recipient. However, in 2013, a law was passed that ended a ban on transplanting organs from donors with HIV into HIV-positive recipients because of better HIV therapy as well as high waiting list mortality rates for patients with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although septicemia is usually considered a contraindication to donation, organs from bacteremic donors have been used successfully. A large retrospective study, for example, showed similar 30-day graft and patient survival in recipients of organs from bacteremic and non-bacteremic donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The OPO representative obtains a medical history, evaluates for a history of substance or alcohol abuse, and performs a physical examination. Laboratory testing generally includes ABO blood type, complete blood count (CBC), chemistries, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B core antigen (HBc), anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV), anti-HIV, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) or rapid plasma reagin (RPR), and anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV). Blood and urine cultures are performed if the prospective donor was hospitalized for more than 72 hours. OPOs obtain nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HIV and HCV in all or selected high risk donors to shorten the window period between acquisition of infection and detection by ELISA in order to reduce the risk of transmission to the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ultrasound imaging or liver biopsy is performed if needed.</p><p>The local OPO is responsible for donor maintenance until the time of procurement. Vital signs, intake, and output are monitored. Fluids and vasopressors are given as needed to achieve hemodynamic stability. Antibiotics are provided if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Living donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This topic is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Comparisons among these studies can be difficult since variable clinical endpoints have been measured, recipients had different forms of underlying liver disease, and because donors are often selected based upon recipient characteristics. Clinical endpoints frequently include the following measures: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial graft function </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary nonfunction (PNF, ie, graft failure in the immediate postoperative period) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graft survival and </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient survival</p><p/><p>Donor factors that have been associated with adverse outcomes include advanced donor age, donor sex or donor-recipient sex mismatch, moderate to marked hepatic steatosis, and donor hypernatremia. </p><p>Strategies used to increase available donor livers may affect outcomes. These strategies include adult living donor liver transplantation, donation after cardiac death, the use of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive donors for HCV-infected recipients, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive donors for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive and anti-hepatitis B core antigen (HBc)-positive recipients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'De novo HBV infection/reactivation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=living-donor-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Living donor liver transplantation&quot;</a>.).</p><p>Although donor characteristics and technical factors will be discussed individually, a combination of risk factors may interact to affect outcomes in individual patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Older age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of livers from older donors is now a common practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, livers from older donors can have more initial dysfunction due to ischemic or preservation injury and in recipients with hepatitis C, there is an association of donor age with the development of severe recurrent hepatitis C. Delayed non-function may occur, necessitating retransplantation. Use of organs felt to be of good quality on careful inspection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and minimizing cold ischemia time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] may help to maximize outcomes when livers are used from older donors.</p><p>Several studies have evaluated the relationship between donor age and recipient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/4,6-8,15,16,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-8,15,16,18-21</a>]. An illustrative report included 772 patients who underwent liver transplantation at three centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Older donors were defined as those aged 50 years and above. Laboratory parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and prothrombin time were higher in recipients with older donors during the first week after transplantation. More importantly, graft survival was reduced at three months in recipients of livers from older donors and this difference persisted to 24 months post-transplant. In multivariate analysis controlling for donor and recipient factors, reduced graft survival was identified only for older donors when the allograft was rated to be poor or fair in quality by the surgeon at the time of harvest. Similar results have been reported in several other series, although the exact donor age associated with worsening outcomes has varied. Other studies suggest that acceptable outcomes can be achieved with selected older donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/7,8,16,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,16,22,23</a>]. Limiting cold ischemia time and degree of steatosis were hypothesized to be important in optimizing the results of transplantation from older donors.</p><p>The use of livers from older donors is a particular concern for hepatitis C infected recipients. A single center study of 124 liver transplants showed that donor age &gt;60 years was associated with the development of severe recurrent hepatitis C and provided an optimal age cutoff to predict an increased risk of HCV-related graft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatic steatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Donor livers that appear fatty on inspection are biopsied for histological determination of fat content. Severe macrovesicular steatosis is associated with primary nonfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/12,25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,25-30</a>]. Outcomes are more variable when organs with moderate steatosis are used. Illustrative studies have shown the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study, which analyzed 158 donor liver biopsies, found that moderate fatty change (defined as 30 to 60 percent fat content) was associated with the development of early graft dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report that categorized donor steatosis as mild (&lt;30 percent), moderate (30 to 60 percent), and massive (&gt;60 percent) found an increased frequency of early graft dysfunction and PNF when donor organs had moderate or massive steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Compared with patients who received livers with mild steatosis, graft survival at one month was slightly lower in those who received livers with moderate steatosis and substantially reduced in those given grafts with massive steatosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report of 225 consecutive transplants showed that while &ge;30 percent donor steatosis was associated with early graft dysfunction, five-year recipient survival was similar between patients who received grafts with &lt;30 or &gt;30 percent steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review of the United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Transplant Analysis and Research files examined 5051 liver transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. At one year, 864 (17 percent) of the grafts had failed. The study found that on multivariable analysis, donor livers with greater than 30 percent macrovesicular steatosis had an increased risk of graft loss (relative risk 1.71). Many transplant centers try to avoid using organs with more than 40 percent fatty infiltration and refuse organs with more than 50 percent fat content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypernatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worse outcomes have been reported in liver transplant recipients who receive grafts from donors with hypernatremia. Donor hypernatremia may be a surrogate marker for other factors affecting graft function, including prolonged donor intensive care stay, excessive saline infusion, and negative water balance resulting from aggressive treatment of cerebral edema, and reduced antidiuretic hormone secretion after brain death. In two reports, the rate of graft loss within one month of transplantation was increased when the donor plasma sodium level exceeded 155 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Other investigators observed a direct relationship between donor serum sodium levels and degree of early graft dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Most respondents to a survey of the South-Eastern Organ Procurement Foundation liver transplant centers indicated that the maximum donor serum sodium level that they would accept was 160 to 170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic blood flow decreases with periods of hypotension and the use of high doses of vasopressors predisposing to ischemic liver injury. Early graft dysfunction was observed when donors had hypotension refractory to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> levels exceeding 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the use of high doses of dopamine was not associated with graft dysfunction when the donor's blood pressure was maintained above 90 mmHg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2027514493\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor-recipient mismatch</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2818677349\"><span class=\"h3\">Sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transplantation of livers from female donors was associated with worse outcomes in many, but not all, series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. Some studies suggest that sex-mismatched transplants in which the liver from a female donor is given to a male recipient may be particularly problematic. As an example, a retrospective evaluation of 994 liver transplants performed over 10 years showed significantly lower graft and patient survival for transplantation of female donors into male recipients compared with other donor-recipient combinations (approximately 56 versus 75 percent two-year graft survival) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>A further study of 462 liver transplants with 1.1 to 2.6 years of follow-up found that graft survival was superior with male donors relative to female donors when controlling for other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The poorest results were observed with the use of female donors over age 60. A study of pediatric liver transplant patients also documented superior one and five-year graft and patient survival for male-male donor-recipient pairs compared to males who received livers from female donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The organ allocation system does not take the donor's or recipient's sex into account in distributing livers since other considerations are more important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2839030503\"><span class=\"h3\">ABO compatibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Livers are routinely matched by ABO blood type (ABO identical), although mismatched organs have been used in extreme circumstances. Mismatched organs may either be ABO compatible (eg, an organ from a donor who is type O going to a recipient who is type B) or ABO incompatible (eg, an organ from an donor who is type A going to a recipient who is type B). A retrospective study of 234 liver transplants found that two-year graft survival was 30 percent in 17 ABO-incompatible emergency transplants compared with 76 percent in 55 ABO-compatible emergency transplants and 80 percent in 162 ABO-compatible elective transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Compared with ABO-compatible transplants, humoral rejection, acute cellular rejection, arterial thrombosis, and biliary complications were more common in ABO-incompatible recipients. These data suggest that ABO incompatibility (and not a need for emergency transplantation) was the major reason for graft loss, although the urgent nature of the transplant and severe illness likely had a role as well. Registry data from Europe showed that the risk of mortality was increased nearly two times in recipients of ABO-incompatible livers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, good outcomes have been reported among recipients with blood type O who receive an organ from a donor with blood type A2 with overall and graft survival rates that are similar to those seen when a recipient with blood type O receives an ABO-compatible organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Many centers use ABO-incompatible livers in emergency situations such as fulminant hepatic failure when an ABO-identical or compatible organ is unavailable, with the understanding that retransplantation will be required in some patients. In such cases, perioperative plasmapheresis, intensive induction immunosuppression, and prostaglandin E1 administration may reduce the development of severe acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>There have also been successful elective transplantations of ABO-incompatible organs from living donors. In a series of 22 recipients of ABO-incompatible organs, overall patient and graft survival were 100 percent after a mean follow-up of 10 months (range 3 to 21 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. All of the patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> two weeks prior to transplantation and also underwent plasma exchange with blood group AB fresh frozen plasma every other day prior to transplantation. Plasma exchange transfusion was continued until the IgM and IgG isoagglutinin titers that corresponded to the donor ABO blood group were &le;1:8. During the first two weeks following transplantation, plasma exchange transfusion was repeated if the titers were &gt;1:32. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Cold ischemia time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolonged cold ischemia time (ie, greater than 12 hours) may impact donor organ viability and graft survival. Donor livers are typically preserved in University of Wisconsin storage solution cooled to 0 to 4&ordm; C after harvesting. Cold preservation leads to liver injury over time, and the duration of cold ischemia time (CIT) affects recipient outcomes.</p><p>Early studies showed that CIT exceeding 18 to 20 hours was associated with increased rates of early graft dysfunction, PNF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and need for retransplantation within 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Subsequent reports showed a benefit for maintaining CIT less than 12 hours. Better initial graft function, reduced frequency of PNF, and superior graft and patient survival were observed with CIT less than 12 hours in an analysis that excluded emergency transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Data from a large European registry indicated that the risk of recipient mortality was stable for CIT up to 12 hours and increased with longer preservation times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In multivariate analysis, there was a negative interaction between CIT exceeding 12 hours and recipient age greater than or equal to 60 years, and CIT exceeding 12 hours and status as a previous transplant recipient with graft failure.</p><p>Other studies found that CIT exceeding 12 hours was associated with an increased rate of biliary complications, such as intrahepatic strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Most centers try to limit CIT to less than 12 hours, particularly in the presence of other donor or recipient characteristics that can adversely affect transplant outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3492341849\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK ASSESSMENT INDICIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4047391447\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor risk index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from over 20,000 liver transplants were used to develop a predictive model comprised of donor factors known at the time an organ is offered to quantify the risk of graft failure, and this model is known as the donor risk index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The parameters most strongly associated with graft loss include increasing donor age, donation after cardiac death, and use of <span class=\"nowrap\">split/partial</span> grafts. Other risk factors include African American donors, shorter donors, death due to cerebrovascular accident, and causes of brain death other than trauma or anoxia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2419586443\"><span class=\"h2\">Eurotransplant donor risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analysis of 4701 deceased donors from Eurotransplant and the European Transplant Registry identified risk factors for graft loss in first time recipients who received a deceased donor liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Cold ischemia time, highest serum sodium level, cause of donor death, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) level, and female donor sex were predictors of graft loss at three months. In addition, cold ischemia time, GGT, and cause of donor death were associated with 12-month graft loss. The data were used to construct nomograms to allow for rapid assessment of the complex interaction among risk factors in a given donor. When the donor risk index was applied to the dataset, there was limited agreement with the Eurotransplant nomogram (kappa = 0.23). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for both predictors was relatively low, indicating the difficulty in defining criteria for extended donors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACHES TO EXPAND DONOR LIVER SUPPLY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Donation after cardiac death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an irreversible, catastrophic illness may serve as non-heart-beating donors after withdrawal of care in a controlled hospital setting and after achieving set criteria for cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Such donation is referred to as &quot;donation after cardiac death&quot; (DCD). In the United States, life support is usually withdrawn in the operating room. The patient is observed until the time of death, which is declared by a clinician who is not part of the transplant team. An additional one to five-minute waiting period is mandated before organ retrieval is initiated with femoral artery cannulation and infusion of cold University of Wisconsin storage solution. Warm ischemia time includes the interval between withdrawal from life support and infusion of University of Wisconsin solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Successful outcomes have been reported with mean warm ischemia times of 16.4 + 10.9 minutes to 19 + 9 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. One group suggested that they would accept warm ischemia times of up to one hour for livers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Studies comparing recipients of organs from DCD donors with standard brain-dead deceased donors have been variable, with some showing similar outcomes, while other suggest decreased graft and patient survival following receipt of a DCD donor organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/53-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-58</a>]. However, many of the studies are limited by the fact that they were not randomized, potentially leading to disparate outcomes that were not the result of the type of donor organ.</p><p>Some of the largest studies have found the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One series looked at 2572 liver transplantations, 352 of which were from DCD donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Patient survival was significantly lower in the DCD group at 1, 4, 10, and 15 years (84 versus 91 percent, 68 versus 81 percent, 54 versus 67 percent, and 54 versus 58 percent, respectively). In addition, graft survival was also lower in the DCD group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third retrospective series with 200 liver transplantations from DCD donors and 1828 liver transplantations from brain-dead deceased donors did not find any differences in graft or patient survival between the groups at one, three, or five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p/><p>Donor factors associated with graft failure include hepatitis B core antibody positivity, a mean arterial pressure lower than 60 mmHg for more than 20 minutes after the withdrawal of life support, and longer cold ischemia times (&gt;6 hours in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/57,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,59</a>].

A retrospective analysis of 20 patients who received DCD donor found that 60 percent had biliary complications, including 55 percent with serious biliary abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. A second retrospective series found that biliary complications were significantly more likely when DCD donors were used compared with standard, brain-dead deceased donors (47 versus 26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, a lower rate of biliary complications was noted in a third retrospective series with 200 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Biliary complications included ischemic cholangiopathy (12 percent), bile leaks (4 percent), extrahepatic biliary strictures (6 percent), and combined bile leaks and extrahepatic biliary strictures (6 percent).</p><p>Although there may be an increased risk of graft loss and biliary complications, judicious use of DCD donors could provide a substantial number of needed organs. According to some estimates, this practice could expand the organ supply by up to 1000 livers per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

However, studies with up to five years of follow-up, along with the advent of interferon-free direct-acting antiviral treatments for HCV have reduced those concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>], and the use of HCV-positive livers has increased from 7 percent in 2010 to 17 percent in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Outcomes in recipients of HCV+ grafts are discussed separately.

It is generally recommended that grafts from hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)-positive donors should be offered to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive recipients, although recipients who lack HBV markers may also be eligible provided that they receive effective HBV prophylaxis post-transplantation. The use of either hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) or an oral antiviral agent reduces the risk of HBV infection in HBsAg-negative patients who receive an HBcAb-positive liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>].

HBcAb-positive grafts were transplanted into 219 recipients, 66 (30 percent) of whom were HBsAg-positive. Patients who received livers from HBcAb-positive donors were at increased risk for graft loss compared with those who received livers from HBcAb-negative donors (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.56, 95% CI 1.18-2.04). The risk was higher among recipients who were HBsAg-negative than among those who were HBsAg-positive (HR 1.59 versus 1.36). However, since the study was observational, there is a risk of selection bias (eg, patients who were more acutely ill may have been more likely to receive HBcAB-positive grafts).</p><p>More controversial is the use of livers from donors who are HBsAg-positive. Transplantation of such grafts has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>] but should probably not be offered to patients who are HBsAg-negative or to recipients who have concurrent HDV infection since such patients may develop severe HDV related disease after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3417493588\"><span class=\"h2\">Machine liver perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both hypothermic machine perfusion and normothermic ex-vivo liver perfusion (NEVLP) are being studied as techniques to expand the donor pool by limiting the deleterious effects of cold ischemia on extended criteria grafts such as DCD and steatotic livers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. </p><p>A phase 1 study provided proof of concept for the use of an ex-vivo circuit to maintain liver allografts in a physiologic state by perfusion with blood containing oxygen and nutrients at a temperature of 37&deg;C during transportation and storage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-donor-selection/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

Many suitable livers are reduced in size for pediatric transplantation, and are not split with an adult recipient.

One lobe of the liver went to the patient on the waiting list with the same blood type and the highest Model for End-stage Liver Disease score, provided the graft-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) for one of the lobes was at least 0.8 percent. The second lobe went to a recipient with the same blood type in whom the GRWR was 0.8 percent or more.
