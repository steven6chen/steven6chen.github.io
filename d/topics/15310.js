Prevalence studies indicate that 16 to 34 percent of the general population suffers from shoulder pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Patients with rotator cuff pathology comprise a sizeable portion of this subpopulation. A thorough understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the shoulder will help the clinician evaluate these patients.</p><p>The clinical pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of rotator cuff tendinopathy will be reviewed here. The general evaluation of the patient with shoulder pain, the shoulder examination, other specific shoulder problems, and general treatments for tendinopathy are discussed separately.

Histopathological, biochemical, and molecular studies reveal a degenerative process with little evidence of inflammation, although inflammation may play a role initially. The pathophysiology of chronic tendon disorders is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;tendinitis&quot; came into common parlance to describe chronic painful tendon injuries before the underlying pathology was better understood. The terms &quot;tendinosis&quot; or &quot;tendinopathy&quot; may better describe chronic tendon disorders. Despite support for the term &quot;tendinopathy&quot; among experts, the term &quot;tendinitis&quot; is deeply ingrained in clinical practice and the historical literature. In this review, we use the term &quot;tendinopathy&quot; to refer to symptomatic primary rotator cuff tendon disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of shoulder complaints is approximately 11.2 cases per 1000 patients per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Shoulder pain occurs more often in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. In working populations, the incidence of shoulder-related symptoms may be as high as 14 to 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rotator cuff disorders are a significant source of morbidity among manual laborers and those whose work involves a great deal of repetitive motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/2,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-7</a>]. In the general population as well, rotator cuff disease is the most common cause of shoulder pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/2-5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5,8,9</a>]. Any of the rotator cuff tendons may be involved, but the supraspinatus tendon is most frequently injured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repetitive overhead activity, whether in sport or work, is a major risk factor for rotator cuff tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other risk factors include anatomic variants that predispose to rotator cuff impingement, scapular instability or dyskinesis, and older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In the working population, problems in one shoulder can place the contralateral shoulder at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-impingement-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder impingement syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Athletes who perform overhead activity, such as swimming, tennis, throwing, golf, weightlifting, volleyball, and gymnastics, are at risk. Weakness or fatigue of the rotator cuff muscles or secondary supporting muscles is common and can lead to poor mechanics and dysfunction of the shoulder. Instability or hypermobility of the glenohumeral joint unrelated to muscle weakness also predisposes to rotator cuff injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>].</p><p>Certain chronic diseases have been associated with an increased risk for rotator cuff tendinopathy, including increased body-mass index, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Statin therapy may attenuate the risk among patients with hyperlipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical anatomy of the shoulder is discussed in detail elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72709%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;, section on 'Anatomy and biomechanics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC BIOMECHANICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically relevant shoulder motions involving the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints are more complex than previously appreciated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Nevertheless, the function of the rotator cuff is relatively easy to understand and provides the basis for clinical testing.</p><p>Rotator cuff tears most often involve damage to the supraspinatus tendon. The supraspinatus muscle assists in abduction and external rotation of the shoulder. Researchers have tried to identify accurate clinical methods of assessing supraspinatus function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. According to one approach, the function of the supraspinatus can be tested in relative isolation with the arm abducted in the scapular plane (approximately 30 degrees of forward flexion) and the shoulder in full internal rotation (the so-called &quot;empty can&quot; position) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Despite these efforts, it appears that supraspinatus function cannot be tested in isolation because of the inextricable role of other shoulder muscles in abduction and external rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>The infraspinatus muscle assists in external rotation and abduction of the shoulder. It is assisted in these motions by the deltoid, teres minor, and supraspinatus. Although some researchers advocate specific assessment techniques, attempts at isolating infraspinatus function for clinical testing have proved difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>]. The infraspinatus is commonly tested by having the patient isometrically resist external rotation with the arm at the side and the elbow flexed at 90 degrees in a neutral rotation. This method is thought to limit the assistance of the deltoid and supraspinatus.</p><p>The teres minor muscle also assists in external rotation and abduction of the shoulder. EMG studies indicate that the teres minor is especially active in external rotation when the arm is abducted to 90 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Biomechanical studies suggest that the teres minor contributes up to 45 percent of the power of external rotation. With hypertrophy the teres minor can exhibit sufficient strength to compensate for tears in the infraspinatus that might otherwise manifest during testing of external rotation against resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The subscapularis muscle's primary function is to internally rotate the shoulder, but it also assists in abduction and adduction. EMG studies show that the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major assist in internal rotation and may confound clinical testing of the subscapularis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The subscapularis tendon helps to stabilize the long head biceps tendon and tears of the subscapularis can be associated with biceps tendon injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biceps-tendinopathy-and-tendon-rupture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biceps tendinopathy and tendon rupture&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to its motor functions, the rotator cuff compresses the humoral head in the glenoid fossa, thereby stabilizing the glenohumeral joint. By means of this compression, the rotator cuff counterbalances the elevating forces of the deltoid, as well as the forces of other muscles acting on the humerus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Weakness of the rotator cuff can lead to superior subluxation of the humeral head when the shoulder is abducted beyond 90 degrees, predisposing to impingement syndromes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology and the mechanism of injury for rotator cuff tendinopathy remain unclear, but researchers propose two theories: one emphasizes biomechanical factors and the other vascular factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/5,10,16,17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10,16,17,22</a>]. Most likely, elements of both explanations play a role. An alternative approach to describing the mechanism of injury involves intrinsic factors, directly related to the tendon, and extrinsic factors, related to surrounding structures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrinsic mechanism &ndash; This mechanism emphasizes injury within the tendon from tendon overload, degeneration, or other insult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/5,10,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10,16,17</a>]. A compromised microvascular system compounds the problem by creating a &quot;critical zone&quot; of avascularity at the site of injury. This proposed mechanism involving interplay between tendon injury and microvascular compromise remains controversial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Tensile overload during eccentric contraction (ie, muscle contracts while lengthening) with overhead activity is implicated in this mechanism. This is particularly true for the overhead athlete. As an example, when a pitcher's throwing arm decelerates after release of the ball, the lengthening posterior rotator cuff muscles contract to slow the arm. This eccentric contraction places a large tensile load on the posterior rotator cuff.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Age and comorbidity can play a role in this mechanism. Aging tendons develop microtears, calcification, and fibrovascular proliferation. Comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, Marfan's or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes) can contribute to tendon pathology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal complications in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrinsic mechanism &ndash; This mechanism emphasizes the role of compressive forces exerted by surrounding structures in causing rotator cuff injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/5,10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10,16</a>]. Various structures may impinge the rotator cuff, including: the acromion, the coracoacromial ligaments, the coracoid process, and the acromioclavicular joint with osteoarthritic changes on its undersurface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72709%7EEM%2F54102%7EEM%2F69995\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995 \">figure 1A-C</a>). Glenohumeral instability can also lead to secondary compressive forces. The mechanics of such impingement is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Basic biomechanics'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-impingement-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder impingement syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rotator cuff tendinopathy may be a manifestation of shoulder impingement, but must be distinguished from other causes of shoulder pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55507 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53038\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53038 \">table 2</a>). A detailed discussion of the differential diagnosis and clinical assessment of shoulder pain is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-impingement-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder impingement syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In particular, it is important to distinguish rotator cuff tendinopathy from cervical radiculopathy, acromioclavicular osteoarthritis, subacromial bursitis, bicipital tendinopathy, rotator cuff tear, glenoid labrum tear, and adhesive capsulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy complain of shoulder pain with overhead activity. Painful daily activities may include putting on a shirt or brushing hair. Patients may localize the pain to the lateral deltoid and often describe pain at night, especially when lying on the affected shoulder. The history often reveals risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Overhead athletes often complain of pain while performing their sport (eg, pitching, freestyle swimming), weakness, or a decline in performance. Reduced performance generally manifests as diminished speed, accuracy, or endurance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Performance of the shoulder examination is discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;</a>). The portions of this examination of particular relevance to rotator cuff pathology are discussed briefly below.</p><p>Overall, examination techniques for rotator cuff pathology are moderately sensitive, but one small trial found that a battery of carefully performed physical examination tests for rotator cuff tendinopathy failed to diagnose a number of pathologic conditions identified readily by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rotator-cuff-tendinopathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p>Notable examination findings consistent with rotator cuff tendinopathy are described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspection &ndash; With long-standing rotator cuff tendinopathy, atrophy of supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles may be present. A sunken appearance is appreciable in the corresponding scapular fossa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Movement of the scapula of the affected shoulder may demonstrate asymmetric motion compared with the unaffected side. Scapular motion asymmetries may be subtle and dynamic in athletes. The inherent strength of many athletes may produce a normal appearing scapular movement with a single abduction. Repetitive abduction with some resistance to near exhaustion may reveal subtle asymmetries of scapulothoracic movement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H1181467\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Scapulothoracic motion and strength'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck examination &ndash; Shoulder pain may be referred from the neck. It is important to examine the neck and perform a screening neurologic examination to rule out cervical spine pathology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-neck-pain-and-cervical-spine-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with neck pain and cervical spine disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation &ndash; Rotator cuff tendinopathy often creates tenderness over the affected musculature (supraspinatus, infraspinatus) or focal subacromial tenderness at the lateral or posterior-lateral border of the acromion. However, the location of the rotator cuff deep to the deltoid makes palpation difficult and unreliable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H11044346\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Palpation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Range of motion (ROM) &ndash; Painful ROM above 90 degrees of abduction, or pain with internal rotation suggests rotator cuff tendinopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70787\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70787 \">picture 1</a>). Painful arc testing demonstrates greater specificity than sensitivity and is most useful when used in conjunction with the Neer and Hawkins-Kennedy tests. Pain that occurs between 60 and 120 degrees of active abduction marks a positive arc test. Abduction is performed with the arm at 30 degrees of horizontal adduction (ie, in the plane of the scapula). With rotator cuff pathology, passive ROM is usually greater than active ROM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H11044360\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Range of motion'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strength testing &ndash; Supraspinatus strength is evaluated by performing the &quot;empty can&quot; (or Jobe's strength) test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74738\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74738 \">picture 2</a>). Internal and external rotation strength of the shoulder can be tested with the patient's arms at their sides and the elbows in 90 degrees of flexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77117\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77117 \">picture 3</a>). The push-off (or Gerber's lift off) test can be used to assess internal rotation strength (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71635\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71635 \">picture 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H1180003\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Examination for rotator cuff pathology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special tests &ndash; The Neer and Hawkins-Kennedy tests are commonly used to diagnose impingement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76237\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76237 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60425\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60425 \">picture 6</a>).

This test may be positive due to AC joint or rotator cuff pathology, and therefore is most useful for ruling out AC injury when negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromioclavicular-joint-injuries-separated-shoulder#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acromioclavicular joint injuries (&quot;separated&quot; shoulder)&quot;, section on 'History and examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lidocaine</a>&nbsp;injection test &ndash; A subacromial injection of lidocaine can be used to alleviate pain and to distinguish between rotator cuff tendinopathy and tear. Examination with adequate analgesia following injection provides a more accurate assessment of muscle strength. Patients with tendinopathy exhibit normal strength with pain relief; those with a large tear have persistent weakness.</p><p/><p>It is important to distinguish rotator cuff tendinopathy from rotator cuff tear because management is different.

MSK US enables the trained clinician to evaluate tendons while they are in motion and to compare them with the contralateral shoulder at the bedside.

We maintain a lower threshold for referral in the case of high-functioning athletes. If we suspect a rotator cuff tear but the patient has minimal weakness and reasonable motion, we generally embark on a course of conservative medical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If we suspect rotator cuff tendinopathy, we initiate conservative medical management, which includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryotherapy (for acute injuries) (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Acute treatment'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative rest (avoid aggravating activities)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatories (NSAID) for 7 to 10 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Physical therapy'</a> above)</p><p/><p>The duration and success of physical therapy depends upon many factors, including the severity of the tendinopathy, compliance with treatment, and the appropriateness of the program prescribed. We believe that whenever possible it is important for patients to begin rehabilitation under the guidance of a knowledgeable professional (eg, athletic trainer or physical therapist with experience managing rotator cuff injury). The timing of follow up is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> below.)</p><p>If function and symptoms improve over several weeks of physical therapy, we have the patient continue therapy and begin a gradual, stepwise resumption of activities, including sports. Should function fail to improve despite adequate rehabilitation, we obtain imaging studies. MSK US, if not performed previously, is obtained first. We perform a plain radiograph for persistent symptoms to assess for anatomic variants, such as a downsloping acromion or os acromiale, and acromioclavicular or glenohumeral osteoarthritis. We obtain an MRI if the MSK US is nondiagnostic, a rotator cuff tear is suspected, or the diagnosis is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p>Subsequent management depends upon the results of imaging studies. Alternative diagnoses are managed accordingly and clinically significant rotator cuff tears referred to an orthopedic surgeon. For rotator cuff tendinopathy, we continue conservative management. Some clinicians may choose to incorporate adjunct treatments, such as glucocorticoid injection, at this point. Physical therapy may require several months before adequate shoulder function is achieved. We refer the patient to an orthopedic surgeon if, after six to nine months of conservative treatment, patient function and symptoms fail to improve significantly.
