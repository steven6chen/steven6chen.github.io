A randomized trial of 67 patients undergoing an APR found that patients resected using the cylindrical approach had a lower rate of positive circumferential resection margins (CRM) compared with patients undergoing the conventional (lithotomy) approach (5.7 versus 28.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-perineal-resection-apr-open-technique/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients undergoing the cylindrical approach had a statistically similar probability of intra-operative bowel perforation (2 of 35 versus 5 of 32 patients), but a significantly higher median three and six month postoperative visual analogue score (VAS) for pain (VAS 4 versus 1, and 3 versus 0, respectively). In addition, a retrospective review of 109 patients with a potentially curable primary adenocarcinoma found that patients treated by the cylindrical approach (n = 10) had significantly fewer intra-operative perforations compared with patients resected in the lithotomy position (3.7 versus 22.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-perineal-resection-apr-open-technique/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients undergoing the cylindrical approach also had fewer positive CRMs (14.8 versus 40.6 percent). A meta-analysis of six studies with a total of 881 patients compared outcomes following cylindrical versus conventional APR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-perineal-resection-apr-open-technique/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Cylindrical APR was associated with a significantly lower positive CRM involvement (OR 0.36; 95% CI, 0.23-0.58) and lower intraoperative perforation rate (OR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.80, p&lt;0.02) compared with conventional APR. Among four studies, cylindrical APR was also associated with a significantly lower local recurrence rate (OR 0.27;95% CI,0.08-0.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-perineal-resection-apr-open-technique/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Rationale for the improved results with the cylindrical approach to a perineal resection includes more tissue excised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-perineal-resection-apr-open-technique/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] and the surgeon is more likely to perform the resection in the appropriate tissue plane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-perineal-resection-apr-open-technique/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In the majority of cases, we close the skin primarily. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For defects too large for a primary closure, the perineal defect may require reconstruction with a biological mesh or a myocutaneous flap, such as a pedicled gluteus maximus, gracilis, or rectus abdominal flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-perineal-resection-apr-open-technique/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a randomized trial of 104 patients who underwent pelvic radiation followed by extralevator APR, standard sutured closure of the perineal defect and closure with a porcine acellular dermal mesh sutured to the pelvic floor remnants resulted in uncomplicated perineal wound healing at 30 days in similar percentages of patients (66 versus 63 percent). At one year, fewer patients with mesh closure had perineal hernias (73 versus 87 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-perineal-resection-apr-open-technique/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is no consensus for the optimal flap for immediate repair of the pelvic defect. In a retrospective review of 133 patients undergoing an APR or pelvic exenteration for cancer resection, patients with a perineal defect closed with a vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (VRAM; n = 114) had significantly fewer major complications compared with closure with a gracilis flap (15 versus 42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-perineal-resection-apr-open-technique/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients with a VRAM closure also had fewer rates of donor cellulitis (6 versus 26 percent), pelvic abscesses (6 versus 32 percent), and wound dehiscence (5 versus 21 percent). Harvesting VRAM flaps did not increase early abdominal wall complications. The decision on the type of flap formation will be influenced by patient factors (current smoker, lifestyle factors), tumor factors (neoadjuvant therapy, size of defect to be repaired), and operative expertise in the unit offering the surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The authors do not drain the perineum; however, other surgeons may opt to use closed suction drains.
