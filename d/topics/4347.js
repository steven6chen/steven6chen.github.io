Individuals affected by both anxiety and depressive disorders concurrently have generally shown greater levels of functional impairment, reduced quality of life, and poorer treatment outcomes compared with individuals with only one disorder.</p><p>Studies of the clinical presentation, course, assessment, and diagnosis of these conditions have largely focused on the co-occurrence of depression and generalized anxiety disorder. The diagnosis of these conditions is complicated by the presence of mixed anxiety and mood states as well as substantial overlap in physical and emotional symptoms of the disorders. Anxious distress was included as a subtype of major depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbid-anxiety-and-depression-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis of comorbid anxiety and depression. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, diagnosis, and treatment of individual depressive and anxiety disorders are described separately.

Mood disorders have shown the highest correlations with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and the lowest with agoraphobia and specific phobias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F86955\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86955 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H32457357\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Research has found that patients with co-occurring anxiety and mood disorders were more likely to be female, younger (25 to 34 years), have a lower education level, live alone, be unemployed, have a parental psychiatric history, and to have experienced childhood trauma than those with purely an anxiety or mood disorder. (See <a href=\"#H32457378\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While our understanding of the etiology of co-occurring anxiety and depression is limited, research has identified similarities between the two disorders in their neurobiology, genetic structure, and presence of neuroticism and harm avoidance. (See <a href=\"#H32457385\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Co-occurring anxiety and depressive disorders have been found to differ from the individual disorder categories in age of onset, life course, and treatment outcome. Presence of both disorders together significantly decreases the odds of recovery, increases the time to therapeutic onset for pharmacotherapy, and is associated with a more chronic course. (See <a href=\"#H32457507\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of comorbid anxiety and depression are often complex. Both anxiety and depressive disorders present overlapping symptoms including irritability, <span class=\"nowrap\">agitation/restlessness,</span> difficulties concentrating, insomnia, and fatigue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F87209\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87209 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H428203\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxious distress was included as a specifier for major depression in DSM-5. Anxious distress is characterized by the presence of two or more symptoms of anxiety during most days of the depressive episode. Major depression with anxious distress will often denote the presence of one or more comorbid anxiety, obsessive-compulsive spectrum, or traumatic stress-related disorders. (See <a href=\"#H120752545\" class=\"local\">'Major depressive disorder with anxious distress'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H24274330\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Depressive episode subtypes (specifiers)'</a>.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">American Psychiatric Association.
