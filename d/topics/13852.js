This topic will review the signs and symptoms of polyradiculopathy by spinal region, and provide an overview of the most common etiologies. Diagnostic testing and the differential diagnosis are also discussed.</p><p>Cervical and lumbosacral radiculopathy are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179611\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION BY SPINAL LEVEL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main feature that distinguishes radiculopathy from other neurologic disorders is that the symptoms and signs of radiculopathy follow sensory and motor nerve root distributions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53938\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53938 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68394 \">table 1</a>). However, since polyradiculopathy by definition affects multiple nerve roots, it can mimic conditions such as polyneuropathy, plexopathy, and mononeuropathy multiplex, making the diagnosis quite challenging. Often, objective signs such as weakness, sensory loss, and reflex change are mild in comparison with complaints of pain and paresthesia. Although there are certainly exceptions to this rule, the subtlety of physical examination findings in polyradiculopathy is a consequence of collateral motor and sensory innervation and incomplete nerve root damage.</p><p>Although precise details as to the prevalence of polyradiculopathy by spinal region are not readily available, 60 to 90 percent of single-level radiculopathies occur in the lumbosacral levels. Cervical radiculopathy accounts for most of the balance, with thoracic radiculopathy representing only a small minority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is likely that polyradiculopathy also follows a similar prevalence by region.</p><p>Cervical polyradiculopathy presents with neck pain radiating unilaterally or bilaterally into the arms with associated paresthesia, weakness, and sensory loss. The most common cause of cervical polyradiculopathy is degenerative cervical spondylosis, which can be accompanied by signs of cervical myelopathy such as spasticity and weakness in the lower extremities and bladder incontinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-spondylotic-myelopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical spondylotic myelopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thoracic polyradiculopathy is the least common of the polyradiculopathies, mainly because spinal stenosis and associated foraminal narrowing in this region is generally modest, even in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Symptoms include pain and paresthesia in the chest and abdomen and, occasionally, abdominal wall weakness with herniation of abdominal contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Lumbosacral polyradiculopathy accounts for the majority of polyradiculopathy cases. Central canal spinal stenosis in this region classically presents as neurogenic claudication, characterized by an aching that begins in the buttocks and descends into the knees, is brought on by walking or exercise, and is relieved by forward flexion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Symptoms'</a>). Spinal stenosis may also affect the lateral recesses, producing compression of multiple nerve roots without claudication symptoms. Diabetic amyotrophy is another well-known, but less common cause of lumbosacral polyradiculopathy-like symptoms, although the exact localization of this disorder remains unresolved (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-amyotrophy-and-idiopathic-lumbosacral-radiculoplexus-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic amyotrophy and idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy&quot;</a>).</p><p>A variant of lumbosacral polyradiculopathy is the cauda equina syndrome, in which the cauda equina itself is compressed within the spinal canal. The most common cause for this is a large, central disc herniation or central spinal canal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Cauda equina syndrome is generally considered a neurologic emergency characterized by progressive lower extremity weakness, sphincter dysfunction, and saddle anesthesia. Other causes of cauda equina syndrome include epidural abscess, epidural tumor, intradural extramedullary tumor, the tethered cord syndrome, inflammatory conditions including spinal arachnoiditis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and sarcoidosis. The cauda equina syndrome can also be caused by infection with cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, and tuberculosis. In the case of acute disk herniation, cauda equina syndrome may require urgent surgical evaluation and treatment to preserve neurologic function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Cauda equina syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179618\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiologies of polyradiculopathy can generally be divided into structural (or surgical) and nonstructural (or medical) categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81525 \">table 2</a>). The most common etiologies, along with their evaluation and treatment, will be discussed in this section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179625\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal stenosis refers to the narrowing of the spinal canal or intervertebral foramina. The majority of cases of spinal stenosis are caused by degenerative change (spondylosis), which is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Degenerative changes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.).</p><p>Presenting with increasing frequency in the sixth and seventh decades, the initiating change in degenerative spinal stenosis is desiccation of the intervertebral discs. As a result of disc desiccation and loss of disc height, the posterior elements of the spine, including the facet joints and ligamentum flavum, become increasingly involved in axial load bearing. The stress placed on these structures results in compensatory bony and ligamentous hypertrophy and osteophyte formation, which narrows both the diameter of the central spinal canal and the neural foramina. Because the degenerative process occurs at multiple levels, polyradiculopathy often results.</p><p>Additional causes of spinal stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81525 \">table 2</a>) include congenital conditions, such as hereditary spinal stenosis or achondroplasia, and systemic conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis or Paget disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p>The symptoms and signs of polyradiculopathy due to spinal stenosis vary according to spinal level:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the cervical level, symptoms of polyradiculopathy in isolation include arm pain, paresthesias, weakness, and sensory loss (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;</a>). More worrisome is adjacent spinal cord dysfunction (ie, cervical myelopathy), characterized by leg weakness, gait difficulty, and incontinence of bowel or bladder. This condition is a potential neurologic emergency and may require urgent decompressive surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-spondylotic-myelopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical spondylotic myelopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar spinal stenosis may produce lower back pain radiating into the leg (similar to that which occurs in herniated nucleus pulposus) or may produce the clinical syndrome of neurogenic claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients with neurogenic claudication characteristically experience aching that begins in the buttocks and descends to the knees, is brought on by walking or exercise, and is relieved by forward flexion. This can be distinguished from the symptoms of vascular claudication of the lower extremities, which is also characterized by pain with exercise. True vascular claudication is relieved by shorter rest periods, is not aggravated by lumbar extension, is accompanied by diminished or absent lower extremity pulses, and is often quite asymmetric. Central canal stenosis of the lumbar spine may also produce the cauda equina syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p>MRI has become the test of choice in the evaluation of spinal stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59200\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59200 \">image 1</a>), although bony changes such as osteophyte formation are better demonstrated by CT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p>Because the radiographic changes of spinal stenosis are so common in older patients, however, the history and physical examination remain critical in establishing the relevance of neuroimaging findings and determining appropriate therapy. Electrodiagnostic studies are often required to confirm the diagnosis when the clinical presentation is ambiguous.

It can also produce polyradiculopathy in adults. During early development, a defect in the dura mater allows communication of the spinal cord with subcutaneous tissues, anchoring the conus medullaris and preventing the normal upward migration of the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The tethered cord syndrome presents in childhood or in adulthood as pain in the lower extremities and perianal region, progressive weakness, sensory disturbances, and sphincter dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Because the cauda equina and conus medullaris are affected, both spastic and flaccid bowel and bladder dysfunction may be noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In most adult cases, motor weakness does not follow a strict myotomal pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In tethered cord syndrome, cutaneous signs of spinal dysraphism such as sacral dimples or tufts of hair over the lumbosacral spine are very frequent in pediatric-onset cases but present in only approximately 35 percent of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>MRI usually demonstrates a low lying termination of the conus medullaris below the inferior aspect of the L2 vertebral body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75372\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75372 \">image 2</a>), but occasionally the conus level is at or above <span class=\"nowrap\">L2/L3</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Associated structural abnormalities on MRI may include a thickened filum terminale, an intradural or extradural lipoma, a myelomeningocele, fibrous adhesions around the conus or the filum, a split cord malformation, and various types of cyst (eg, arachnoid, dermoid, enteric).</p><p>Surgical treatment of tethered cord syndrome involves lumbar or sacral laminectomy with sectioning of the thickened filum terminale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A systematic review of 451 adult cases of tethered cord syndrome published in 2008 reported that surgery was associated with improvement in pain and motor deficits in 83 and 59 percent of patients, respectively, while sphincter and sensory deficits improved in 46 and 43 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most of the included studies were uncontrolled series or case reports, and few patients were followed beyond two years after surgery. Thus, the benefit of surgery for tethered cord syndrome is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179653\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of primary tumors may cause polyradiculopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81525 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The one that most characteristically does so is ependymoma, classically presenting as a cauda equina syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Surgery is the preferred treatment for most primary tumors that produce polyradiculopathy, with the need for postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy dictated by tumor histology and the completeness of the surgical resection.

The latter two are together called the leptomeninges. Tumor involvement of the leptomeninges is a condition termed leptomeningeal metastases. It is also known by a variety of synonyms, including meningeal carcinomatosis, carcinomatous meningitis, and neoplastic meningitis. This disorder is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-from-solid-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-carcinomatous-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of leptomeningeal metastases (carcinomatous meningitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cluster of symptoms related to leptomeningeal metastases is widespread (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74299\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74299 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Leptomeningeal metastases can cause polyradiculopathy by direct involvement of the spinal nerve roots, and radicular pain is the most common presenting symptom. The primary malignancies that most frequently produce this syndrome are leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and gastrointestinal cancers.</p><p>The classic CSF findings of leptomeningeal metastases include a high opening pressure, low glucose concentration, high protein concentration, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and positive cytology for malignant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Although most patients do not have all of these features, an entirely normal CSF examination is uncommon. Initial CSF examination reveals a mildly increased cell count in 50 to 60 percent of patients, elevated protein in a large majority, and low glucose in about 30 percent. In most cases, a positive cytology can be obtained with two separate samplings. However, CSF cytology is persistently negative in as many as 20 percent of patients with clinically or radiographically unequivocal leptomeningeal metastases. MRI may reveal contrast enhancement of the meninges and nerve roots in a diffuse or nodular pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60153\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60153 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>The diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases is straightforward in the patient with advanced cancer, multifocal signs and symptoms, typical imaging findings by MRI, and positive CSF cytology. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the symptomatic region of brain or spine should be obtained prior to obtaining CSF by lumbar puncture or ventricular tap, because the latter procedures can cause iatrogenic meningeal enhancement. A positive CSF cytology establishes the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases. At least two CSF samples, with a combined total of 30 mL, should be evaluated. However, obtaining CSF for cytology may be unnecessary in patients with typical signs and symptoms, characteristic MRI findings, and known widespread malignancy.

The most likely cause of diabetic amyotrophy and the clinically similar condition of idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is ischemic injury from a nonsystemic microvasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

Diabetic amyotrophy may be the first symptom of diabetes, and most patients who develop the condition do not have poorly-controlled diabetes. The traditional features include the acute, asymmetric, focal onset of pain followed by weakness involving the proximal leg. However, onset in the distal leg is not uncommon. Furthermore, the condition becomes more widespread and symmetric with time. In many cases, the symptoms and signs progress to affect the contralateral limb and the distal legs. There are associated symptoms including fever, weight loss, malaise, and autonomic failure. Progression occurs over months and is followed by partial recovery in most patients.

Appropriate laboratory investigations, particularly electrodiagnostic studies, and neuroimaging in select patients, are useful to exclude other peripheral and central nervous system etiologies as a cause of the neurologic symptoms and signs. Abnormalities on electrodiagnostic studies typically involve the lumbar and sacral roots, the lumbosacral plexus, and the peripheral nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Nerve conduction studies show markedly reduced amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials and sensory nerve action potentials, while conduction velocities show only mild slowing. Needle electromyography shows fibrillation potentials, decreased motor unit recruitment, and long-duration, high amplitude motor unit action potentials. Paraspinal muscles are typically involved; this finding demonstrates that pathology must exist outside of the lumbosacral plexus. In patients who do not have diabetes, idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is the primary consideration in the differential diagnosis.

These manifestations may occur alone or in combination, but radiculoneuritis is less common than meningitis or facial palsy in the United States. Peripheral nerve involvement in Lyme disease primarily consists of a multifocal axonal process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77485 \">table 4</a>). Lyme radiculoneuritis is reported in approximately 3 percent of Lyme disease cases in the United States. Lyme radiculoneuritis can mimic a mechanical radiculopathy (eg, sciatica) with radicular pain in one or several dermatomes, accompanied by corresponding sensory, motor, and reflex changes. This disorder should be considered in patients in endemic areas presenting in spring through autumn with severe limb or truncal radicular pain without an apparent mechanical precipitant.

Sensory dysesthesia can begin in the feet or in the saddle region from involvement of sacral roots. Symptoms can be asymmetric, especially early in the course of the disease. Clinical progression occurs rapidly over days, leading to flaccid paraparesis or paraplegia with urinary retention and sphincter dysfunction. A less fulminant, more slowly progressing variant has also been described. On examination, a lumbar sensory level and lower extremity areflexia with saddle anesthesia can be demonstrated. Sacral radiculomyelitis can also be seen secondary to genital herpes simplex virus infection; this syndrome can occur at any stage of HIV disease. Radiculomyelitis has also been reported rarely with syphilis and tuberculosis infection in HIV-infected patients.</p><p>Lumbar puncture characteristically shows CSF pleocytosis, frequently predominated by polymorphonuclear cells, elevated protein and, in a minority of patients, decreased glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]; with lymphomatous meningitis, the CSF typically reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis. Cytomegalovirus can be cultured from the CSF in some cases. Viral culture cannot be used as the sole means of diagnosis because of false negative results and the fact that viral cultures may not turn positive for up to a week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/33,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,38</a>].

Testing for syphilitic polyradiculopathy in these cases is also recommended; a negative treponemal serologic test in the serum or CSF renders this diagnosis unlikely. Electrophysiologic studies can help confirm the presence of polyradiculopathy and exclude a polyradiculoneuropathy; sensory action potentials are present in patients with a polyradiculopathy but are abnormal in patients with a polyradiculoneuropathy. MRI of the spine should be performed mainly to exclude structural lesions and cauda equina compression. Cauda equina root enhancement with contrast-enhanced MRI is seen in many, but not all, patients with cytomegalovirus-related polyradiculopathy.

However, nerve conduction studies have several limitations in establishing the diagnosis of polyradiculopathy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional nerve conduction studies assess a small number of spinal levels, predominantly C8-T1 in the upper extremities and L5-S1 in the lower extremities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude abnormalities are relatively uncommon in radiculopathy: for patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">L5/S1</span> radiculopathies, CMAPs were absent from the extensor digitorum brevis or flexor digitorum brevis muscles in only 6 percent, and amplitudes were decreased in just 24.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The likelihood of finding CMAP abnormalities in patients with radiculopathy is reduced by overlapping nerve root innervation and the usually incomplete nature of root injury. For similar reasons, slowing of motor conduction velocities between proximal and distal stimulation sites is uncommon and, if present, limited in degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes favor a diagnosis of radiculopathy rather than plexopathy or polyneuropathy because nerve root injury in radiculopathy is most often proximal to the dorsal root ganglion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Nerve fiber degeneration therefore occurs in the axon that projects centrally from the dorsal root ganglion rather than from the one that projects peripherally. However, in inflammatory and neoplastic lesions, damage may occur distal to the dorsal root ganglion and consequently produce abnormal SNAPs. In addition, the SNAP amplitude may be reduced in a subset of patients with L5 nerve root involvement due to the dorsal root ganglia being located within the spinal canal itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p>The late responses known as the H reflex and F wave may be useful in the evaluation of polyradiculopathy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The H reflex is similar to a deep tendon reflex (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve conduction studies: Late responses&quot;, section on 'H reflex'</a>). The main limitation of the H reflex test is that it is commonly obtainable only from the soleus and occasionally from the flexor carpi radialis, which restricts the number of spinal levels that it can assess. It is also somewhat nonspecific, being affected in disorders that injure the neurons anywhere along their path. However, one study that evaluated normal controls and those with an L5 or S1 radiculopathy found that the H reflex for S1 radiculopathy had a sensitivity and specificity of 50 and 91 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyradiculopathy-spinal-stenosis-infectious-carcinomatous-and-inflammatory-nerve-root-syndromes/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve and muscle disease&quot;, section on 'Distinguishing peripheral from central nervous system disease'</a>.)</p><p>Motor neuron disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of upper and lower motor neurons that can be difficult to distinguish from polyradiculopathy. Careful physical examination and electromyography to detect abnormalities of bulbar muscles and mid-thoracic paraspinal muscles help to establish this diagnosis. The absence of any sensory complaints and pain is also suggestive of motor neuron disease over polyradiculopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A variety of peripheral nervous system disorders can imitate polyradiculopathy, and electrodiagnostic testing is often required to establish a clear diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plexopathy is most often characterized by weakness and pain affecting multiple myotomes and dermatomes, and may be the single condition that most closely resembles polyradiculopathy on a clinical level.

Although they are characterized by pain without sensory loss or weakness, the pain produced by these conditions can result in functional weakness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of soft tissue rheumatic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, vascular disease of the lower extremities can produce claudication symptoms that can be differentiated from neurogenic claudication by improvement after shorter rest periods, prominent asymmetry, lack of aggravation by lumbar spine extension, and diminution or absence of peripheral pulses.

However, localization of the problem to multiple nerve roots is often challenging because lesions of the brachial or lumbosacral plexus, peripheral nerves, or central nervous system can present similarly. The tests that are most useful for establishing a diagnosis of polyradiculopathy are electromyography and nerve conduction studies, MRI of the relevant spinal level with and without contrast, and lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analyses.
