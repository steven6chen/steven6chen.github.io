It may be unilateral or bilateral and is diagnosed on exam as a palpable mass of tissue at least 0.5 cm in diameter (usually underlying the nipple).</p><p>The causes and evaluation of gynecomastia will be reviewed here. Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management of gynecomastia and an overview of gynecomastia in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-causes-of-gynecomastia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and causes of gynecomastia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gynecomastia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gynecomastia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-masses-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast masses in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H409071523\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecomastia is defined histologically as a benign proliferation of the glandular tissue of the male breast and clinically by the presence of a rubbery or firm mass extending concentrically from the nipple. Gynecomastia differs from female breast development in that there is no progesterone-induced terminal alveolar development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-development-and-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast development and morphology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physiologic gynecomastia, which resolves spontaneously in most cases, has a trimodal distribution, occurring in neonatal, pubertal, and older males. The estimated prevalence of asymptomatic gynecomastia in these three age groups is 60 to 90 percent in neonates, 50 to 60 percent in adolescents, and 35 to 65 percent in men ages 50 to 69 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Gynecomastia must be differentiated from breast carcinoma, which is far less common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-in-men#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast cancer in men&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"#H409071425\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation to rule out breast cancer'</a> below.)</p><p>The causes of gynecomastia among adult men seeking consultation for the condition can be either physiologic or pathologic and include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53468\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53468 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-causes-of-gynecomastia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and causes of gynecomastia&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent pubertal gynecomastia &ndash; 25 percent.

There are many drugs that have been associated with gynecomastia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71421\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71421 \">table 2</a>).

Germ cell tumors account for approximately 95 percent of testicular neoplasms; between 2.5 and 6 percent of affected patients have gynecomastia at the time of presentation. The gynecomastia is often associated with secretion of hCG, but some testicular (Leydig and Sertoli cell) tumors secrete estradiol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism &ndash; 1.5 percent. Gynecomastia has been reported in as many as 25 to 40 percent of men with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease, although one study suggests that the actual prevalence is less than 10 percent. It is uncommon for gynecomastia to be the sole clinical manifestation of hyperthyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic renal insufficiency &ndash; 1 percent. Gynecomastia occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis. The primary cause of the gynecomastia appears to be Leydig cell dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6320124\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescents typically experience painful, tender gynecomastia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecomastia-in-children-and-adolescents#H27397518\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gynecomastia in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Definition and characteristic features'</a>). In contrast, gynecomastia-associated pain is usually not severe in adults, and most men are asymptomatic. Varying degrees of tenderness and nipple sensitivity with rubbing against a shirt are more common than pain. However, severe symptoms in men are a potential indication for earlier therapeutic intervention, even though these symptoms are usually self-limited, because fibrotic changes begin to develop after 6 to 12 months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gynecomastia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gynecomastia&quot;, section on 'Approach to management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H814973246\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In true gynecomastia, a ridge of glandular tissue will be felt that is reasonably symmetrical to the nipple-areolar complex. Gynecomastia can usually be detected when the size of the glandular tissue exceeds 0.5 cm in diameter. There are four typical features on examination: the glandular tissue is centrally located, symmetrical in shape, usually bilateral, and tender to palpation (if early in its course) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72334\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72334 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Although gynecomastia is usually bilateral, some patients present with unilateral enlargement or bilateral enlargement but one side larger than the other. One side may enlarge weeks to months before the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H814973253\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although imaging is not routinely recommended unless there is concern for possible breast cancer (unilateral, nontender, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fixed masses found eccentric to the nipple-areolar complex), the mammographic features of gynecomastia are described as &quot;a fan-shaped density emanating from the nipple, gradually blending into surrounding fat&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It may have extensions into surrounding fat and an appearance similar to that of a heterogeneously dense female breast. </p><p>The usual imaging studies are mammography and ultrasound. Mammography is difficult to perform if there is not significant gynecomastia. Mammography is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting malignancy, but ultrasonography is the more specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There are three patterns of gynecomastia seen on ultrasonography: nodular, dendritic, and diffuse glandular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6320193\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic studies show that the glandular changes in the breast are the same regardless of etiology, and the extent of glandular proliferation depends upon the intensity and duration of the stimulation. The histologic picture changes over time.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initially, there is extensive ductal epithelial hyperplasia, proliferation and lengthening of the ducts, an increase in the stromal and periductal connective tissue, and proliferation of periductal inflammatory cells. There is also extensive periductal edema and stromal fibroblastic proliferation. This is the early or florid stage of gynecomastia, generally is present for the first six months after onset, and is associated with pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After 12 or more months, the breast tissue evolves into the late or quiescent stage. At this time, there is a slight increase in the number of ducts, with marked dilatation of the ducts and little or no epithelial cell proliferation. There is also an increase in the amount of stroma, stromal fibrosis, and a disappearance of the inflammatory reaction. Pain and tenderness are uncommon during this stage.</p><p/><p>It is unlikely that any medical therapy will result in significant regression in the late fibrotic stage. As a result, medical therapies, if used, should be tried early in the course.

The examination is performed by having the patient lie on his back with his hands behind his head. The examiner then places his or her thumb and forefinger on each side of the breast and slowly brings them together (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72334\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72334 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These patients have diffuse breast enlargement without any subareolar glandular tissue. When examining the patient with pseudogynecomastia, the fingers will not meet any resistance until they reach the nipple, eg, there is no discrete mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72334\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72334 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6317477\"><span class=\"h3\">Breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecomastia needs to be differentiated from other causes of breast masses, most importantly, breast cancer. Breast cancers are typically unilateral, nontender, and often fixed masses found eccentric to the nipple-areolar complex. In addition, they are firm-to-hard in texture and may be associated with skin dimpling, nipple discharge, and regional lymphadenopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F57959\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57959 \">algorithm 1</a>). If the differentiation cannot be made by physical examination, ultrasonography or mammography should be done.

When examining the patient with pseudogynecomastia, the fingers will not meet any resistance until they reach the nipple, eg, there is no discrete mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72334\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72334 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6317470\" class=\"local\">'Pseudogynecomastia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gynecomastia needs to be differentiated from other causes of breast masses, most importantly, breast cancer. Breast cancers are typically unilateral, nontender, and often fixed masses found eccentric to the nipple-areolar complex. In addition, they are firm-to-hard in texture and may be associated with skin dimpling, nipple discharge, and regional lymphadenopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F57959\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57959 \">algorithm 1</a>). If the differentiation cannot be made by physical examination, mammography or ultrasonography should be done. (See <a href=\"#H409071425\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation to rule out breast cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The combination of a careful history and physical examination and a few diagnostic tests can result in the identification of the cause of gynecomastia in the majority of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F57959\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57959 \">algorithm 1</a>).
