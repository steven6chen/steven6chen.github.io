Several other staging systems have been proposed, but with limited consensus. The lack of a uniform staging system has hindered the direct comparison of clinical trials. The most widely accepted staging system is the Lugano staging system.</p><p>The Lugano staging system was developed to incorporate measures of distant nodal involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65686\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65686 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Early (stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II)</span> disease includes a single primary lesion or multiple, noncontiguous lesions confined to the gastrointestinal tract that may have nodal involvement.

There have been no randomized clinical trials comparing different treatment options in this population. Prospective single arm trials and retrospective series have evaluated the use of <em>H. pylori</em> eradication, radiation therapy (RT), and surgery. Of these, <em>H. pylori</em> eradication has emerged as the preferred treatment because of its low side effect profile and demonstrated efficacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115197\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115197 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>After initial therapy, patients must be monitored with serial endoscopies to evaluate for disease response, EMZL recurrence, and the development of gastric adenocarcinoma.

There have been no comparisons of various <em>H. pylori</em> eradication regimens in this setting, and a choice among these depends on local resistance patterns and patient-related factors such as penicillin allergy.

A comparison of these trials is limited by a lack of consensus regarding response evaluation and the definition of complete response (CR). The following is a summary of the results of these trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/11-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost all patients were able to successfully eradicate the <em>H. pylori</em> infection, but approximately 20 percent required a second course of <em>H. pylori</em>-directed therapy to do so.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic CR was achieved in 50 to 83 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median time from <em>H. pylori</em> eradication to CR was 15 months, but ranged from five months to over three years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After a median follow-up of 6.8 years, one study reported disease relapse in 16 of 74 patients (22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>In comparison, patients treated with RT almost always attain a CR and have lower relapse rates (less than 5 percent), but have a potential for more complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. Gastrectomy is associated with high morbidity and higher recurrence rates than seen with RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p>Up to one-third of gastric EMZL will demonstrate the t(11;18) translocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/17,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25-28</a>]; such patients have a lower chance of responding to <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy. As an example, one study with a median follow-up of over five years, reported lower rates of continuous CR following antibiotic treatment in tumors with t(11;18) when compared with those without this translocation (30 versus 77 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Despite this lower response rate, we use <em>H. pylori</em> eradication for the initial management of these patients because of its low toxicity profile and chance of long-term control in a minority of patients.</p><p>Few studies have evaluated the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients achieving a CR. A randomized trial of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> versus observation in patients achieving histologic CR with <em>H. pylori</em> eradication failed to show a progression-free or overall survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3009630814\"><span class=\"h3\">Response evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients initially treated with <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy are evaluated after the completion of treatment to determine whether the <em>H. pylori</em> was successfully eradicated and whether there has been a tumor response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115197\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115197 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirm eradication &ndash; Four weeks after the completion of <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy, testing should be performed to confirm eradication of infection. Up to 20 percent of patients will require a second <em>H. pylori</em> eradication regimen to fully eliminate the infection. We offer up to three eradication regimens before pursuing alternative therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-diagnostic-tests-for-helicobacter-pylori-infection#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;, section on 'Confirmation of eradication'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess tumor response &ndash; After successful eradication of <em>H. pylori</em>, patients should undergo periodic upper endoscopy with multiple biopsies to evaluate for tumor response and monitor for relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>]. While this has not been formally studied, we typically perform endoscopy with biopsies every three months until a histologic CR is attained, and then perform endoscopy every six months for at least the first two years and then suggest endoscopy every 18 months and as clinically indicated. Surveillance can stop in asymptomatic patients once two sequential endoscopies show no abnormalities on biopsy. Surveillance endoscopy in patients with persistent chronic gastritis, gastric atrophy, and <span class=\"nowrap\">gastric/intestinal</span> metaplasia is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-intestinal-metaplasia#H5283746\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric intestinal metaplasia&quot;, section on 'Surveillance'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Unfortunately, there has been little consensus regarding what constitutes a CR of gastric EMZL. The Wotherspoon histological index (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78881\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78881 \">table 4</a>) originally devised to differentiate between gastritis and EMZL at the time of diagnosis has been reported to have a high rate of inter-observer variation when applied to post-treatment biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/11,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,31,32</a>]. Using these criteria, patients who demonstrate grade 0 to 2 lesions are considered to have a histologic CR, while grade 3 lesions are classified as a partial response (PR). In contrast, the GELA score defines a histological CR as a normal or empty lamina propria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrosis with absent or sparse plasmacytes and lymphoid cells in the lamina propria without lymphoepithelial lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>]. While there appears to be a low degree of inter-observer variation when the GELA score is used, prospective studies are needed to validate its prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>While successful treatment with radiation usually results in the disappearance of B cell clonality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], treatment with <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy often demonstrates persistent B cell clonality on molecular studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The ultimate clinical significance of persistent clonality in these treatment settings is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/16,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,35-37</a>]. As an example, in a study of patients achieving histologic CR following eradication of <em>H. pylori</em>, there was no significant difference in the rate of histologic relapse between those who did or did not achieve molecular remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In general, we consider RT such as that given for <em>H. pylori</em>-negative gastric EMZL if disease is still present after 12 to 18 months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115197\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115197 \">algorithm 1</a>).

This is principally due to the high CR rates, low toxicity profile, and long-term remissions associated with this approach. Immunotherapy and chemotherapy are reserved for patients failing or recurring after RT and those with advanced stage disease (ie, Lugano stage IV). </p><p>The data regarding these and other treatment options come from retrospective studies and small, single agent prospective trials.

The treatment of non-gastric EMZL depends principally on the stage of disease and area involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 5</a>). Limited stage EMZL includes those patients with involvement of a single extralymphatic site (IE) or a lymph node extending into a contiguous extralymphatic organ or tissue (IIE).</p><p>Limited stage EMZL is generally treated with local therapy or managed expectantly.

Single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> is a noninvasive alternative for the treatment of sites that cannot receive RT. There are occasional patients with stage I disease who are not ideal candidates for RT and may be initially observed closely. The addition of adjuvant chemotherapy or antibiotic therapy has not demonstrated improved disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) rates in non-gastric EMZL.

At these doses, early radiation toxicity includes cutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conjunctival reactions, while long-term effects include cataract formation (30 to 50 percent), xerophthalmia (20 to 40 percent), and retinopathy (2 percent). While lens shielding may reduce the risk of cataract development, it may also increase the risk of local relapse. Higher doses (eg, 36 Gy) should not be used and can result in ischemic retinopathy, optic atrophy, corneal ulceration, and vision loss due to neovascular glaucoma.</p><p>Select patients may be observed following initial resection. The pathologic diagnosis of EMZL may become apparent only after a resection has taken place. Complete resection may be possible for patients with conjunctival and lacrimal gland lesions. Patients with negative surgical margins may be observed initially. Adjuvant involved-field RT is offered to those with positive surgical margins for local control. Older adults and asymptomatic patients may also select initial observation following surgery. In a retrospective study with a median follow-up of seven years, 25 of 36 patients (69 percent) with marginal zone lymphoma of the ocular adnexa did not require therapy beyond biopsy or resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].
