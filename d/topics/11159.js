This food allergy presents with a wide range of clinical syndromes due to immunologic responses to cow's milk proteins that can be immunoglobulin E (IgE) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> non-IgE mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. CMA does not include other adverse reactions to milk, such as lactose intolerance, which are nonimmune mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues of cross-reactivity among milk of different mammalian species (such as sheep and goat) are addressed here. This topic also reviews various aspects of management of milk allergy, including instructions about avoidance of milk protein, replacement of milk with alternative protein and calcium sources, education in the proper management of accidental exposures, and monitoring for resolution of the allergy. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of milk allergy are discussed separately. General discussions of food allergy are presented separately in appropriate topic reviews.

However, some patients with CMA may tolerate milk from other mammals, such as camels, pigs, reindeer, horses, and donkeys. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-nutritional-issues#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Nutritional issues&quot;, section on 'Children &gt;1 year old'</a>.)</p><p>Mammals that are phylogenetically related, such as cow and water buffalo, sheep and goat, and horse and donkey, have similar milk protein expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In vitro studies have shown extensive cross-reactivity between milk from cows, sheep, and goats but only weak cross-reactivity with proteins from donkeys and mares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Significant amino acid sequence homology and a resulting high rate of clinical cross-reactivity between milk from ruminants (eg, approximately 90 percent of children with immunoglobulin E [IgE]-mediated CMA react to goat's milk) make milk from sheep and goats inappropriate feeding alternatives for most CMA individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, some patients with primary goat's or sheep's milk allergy may tolerate cow's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Cosensitization assessed by skin testing to deer's, ibex's (wild mountain goat), and buffalo's milk is common in patients with CMA, but positive skin tests to camel's and pig's milk are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There is also only partial cross-reactivity between cow's milk and reindeer's milk beta-lactoglobulins in patients with CMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, studies on clinical tolerability of these alternative mammalian milks are missing.</p><p>Clinical studies on allergenicity of equine milk (mare's and donkey's milk) suggest it may be tolerated by most children with CMA, with the possible exception of those individuals who have a history of anaphylaxis to milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/7,9,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,14-17</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized, crossover study showed that donkey's milk was better tolerated and more effective than goat's milk in reducing symptoms of atopic dermatitis in children with CMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nearly 90 percent (23 of 26) of these children reacted to goat's milk when challenged, but only one reacted to donkey's milk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were seen in two prospective studies of selected children with CMA.

In the second study, 96 percent (24 of 25) of children tolerated fresh donkey's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. One pilot study demonstrated a high rate of tolerance of donkey's milk in a patient with food protein-induced enterocolitis to cow's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, 80 percent of children with prior anaphylaxis to cow's milk reacted to donkey's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>Human milk does not contain beta-lactoglobulin, unlike other mammalian milks. However, there is significant amino acid sequence homology between other bovine and human milk proteins, suggesting that cross-reactivity between conserved regions of bovine and human casein may exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Clinical allergy to human milk was shown in one case report, and sensitization to human milk was reported in two studies, although confirmatory clinical data are missing and the clinical significance is largely unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-reactivity to other protein sources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with IgE-mediated CMA tolerate soy and cooked beef.</p><p>Cosensitization (by skin testing) to soy is common in patients with CMA, but clinical coallergy due to cross-sensitization based upon cross-reactive proteins between soy and milk is not. In one study, cosensitization to soy milk was noted in 17 percent of patients with CMA, but all of these patients tolerated ingestion of soy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another small study reported a 10 percent incidence of clinical soy allergy, mostly non-IgE mediated, in infants with CMA fed soy formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These limited data suggest that soy is a safe alternative for many children with CMA, especially those with IgE-mediated CMA.</p><p>Serum albumin is found in both milk and meat. This protein is thought to be involved in cosensitization to milk and beef, reported in 13 to 20 percent of children with CMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Clinical cross-reactivity may be more pronounced with less well-cooked meat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In another study, seven of eight patients with persistent CMA who were sensitized to cow's milk, bovine serum albumin, and animal dander recognized serum albumin in different raw, but not heated, meats (beef, lamb, deer, and pork) and epithelia (dog, cat, and cow) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Eliminating milk from the diet can be difficult and can pose nutritional as well as quality-of-life concerns since milk is a ubiquitous food and is an important source of fat and protein in early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Milk is or may be an ingredient in baked goods, cereals, chocolate, candy, custard, pudding, sherbet, luncheon meats, hot dogs, sausages, margarine, salad dressing, breaded foods, casseroles, soups, and potato, pasta, and vegetable dishes (<a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/file/tips-avoid-allergen.pdf&amp;token=oN6rXOmeBLkIpfIsq5mH5Vubaw4fI+8XYYiBro3ggBQ5hJlAba9Lqx6Ggg3lDfTyNE3jlOaI+lgbIsX7Coa/Rw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2391\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Food Allergy Research and Education [FARE]</a> and <a href=\"https://web.emmes.com/study/cofar/MILKAvoidance.pdf&amp;token=61D79h4FlocEgxiAXo/xoo0cl6Je4x6DO0xHKKODzLHZ9SdnWSDeFzaoaGQKqbKNZtdtlC3M0OifNTIZMsrjrg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2391\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Consortium of Food Allergy Research [CoFAR] sheet on milk</a>).

In one prospective series of 500 infants aged 3 to 15 months with suspected or confirmed egg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> milk allergy, 72 percent had an allergic reaction, most commonly to milk, egg, or peanut, during a three-year period, with an annualized reaction rate of 0.81 per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Eighty-seven percent of these reactions were due to accidental exposures.

This can happen anywhere food is served, including at restaurants using knives and counters contaminated with dairy product and on shared grills. In addition, breads and pastries may be brushed with milk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food labels &ndash; Patients must read all food labels (<a href=\"https://www.foodallergy.org/file/tips-avoid-allergen.pdf&amp;token=oN6rXOmeBLkIpfIsq5mH5Vubaw4fI+8XYYiBro3ggBQ5hJlAba9Lqx6Ggg3lDfTyNE3jlOaI+lgbIsX7Coa/Rw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2391\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FARE</a> and <a href=\"https://web.emmes.com/study/cofar/MILKAvoidance.pdf&amp;token=61D79h4FlocEgxiAXo/xoo0cl6Je4x6DO0xHKKODzLHZ9SdnWSDeFzaoaGQKqbKNZtdtlC3M0OifNTIZMsrjrg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2391\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CoFAR sheet on milk</a>). Legislation has been enacted in the United States mandating that ingredient labels on food packages plainly identify the presence of eight specified allergenic foods, including milk (as well as egg, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, fish, and crustacean shellfish). Other countries are addressing issues of food labeling as well.

Labeling of nonfood items is not strictly regulated in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;, section on 'Food allergens in nonfood items'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4207185518\"><span class=\"h3\">Extensively heated milk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many individuals with CMA can tolerate extensively heated or baked forms of milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. However, the only available diagnostic test to determine which individuals can tolerate extensively heated milk (unless it is currently in their diet) is an oral food challenge, although casein-specific IgE may aid in risk assessment and low levels are associated with high chance of tolerance of cow&rsquo;s milk protein baked into goods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Data suggest that tolerance to extensively heated milk is a good prognostic factor for the development of tolerance to less heated forms of milk and that including extensively heated milk in the diet may accelerate the development of tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Individual clinicians may decide to adopt different strategies depending upon their level of expertise and the resources available (eg, ability to perform oral food challenges).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We allow persons with IgE-mediated allergy to continue to eat milk in more processed forms than what triggered their reaction(s) if they have eaten milk in these forms regularly and in the recent past (similar to passing an oral food challenge). In most cases, this involves patients who reacted to straight milk or lightly processed forms of milk (eg, ice cream, cheese) but have a history of tolerating extensively heated milk (eg, milk in baked goods). We generally suggest that these patients avoid more intermediate forms of cooked or processed milk, such as pudding, yogurt, casseroles, and milk chocolate. However, if the patient wishes to avoid all milk-containing foods, we do not discourage this approach. In contrast, we generally recommend that patients with mixed or non-IgE-mediated allergy, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, avoid milk protein in all forms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One caveat to this approach that should be discussed with patients is that it is possible that a patient may have a reaction due to ingestion of a larger amount of milk or a more lightly cooked or processed form of milk than usual (eg, normally tolerates milk in pancakes but has a reaction when blueberries are used in the pancakes and the batter does not cook completely around the blueberries).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that patients who have reacted to intermediately <span class=\"nowrap\">cooked/processed</span> or extensively heated milk avoid all forms of milk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An oral challenge to extensively heated milk may be performed by an allergy specialist if a patient is not currently eating milk in this form but the patient (or parents of the patient) wishes to introduce it into the diet. Caution is needed because severe reactions can occur from this type of oral food challenge. In addition, the impact of ingesting heated milk on the course of the allergy is not yet understood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of reactions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of individuals with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated milk allergy is important because these patients are at risk for severe reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64957\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64957 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/milk-allergy-management/abstract/35,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,40-43</a>].

In these cases, avoidance of milk is not recommended for nursing mothers. Hydrolyzed formula is recommended for formula-fed infants or for supplementation for breastfed infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79377 \">table 2</a>). Delayed introduction of milk-containing products beyond six months of age is not recommended, unless the infant is showing signs of allergic disease (straight milk is delayed until one year of age for other reasons). These issues are discussed in greater detail separately.
