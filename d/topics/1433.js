Rapid assessment of the adequacy of systemic perfusion is an essential part of pediatric resuscitation. It is accomplished by evaluation of mental status, capillary refill, pulses, and blood pressure.</p><p>The pathophysiology of the maintenance of cardiac output and assessment of perfusion during pediatric resuscitation are reviewed here. Epidemiology and outcome of pediatric resuscitation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and medications used in resuscitation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric advanced life support (PALS)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-drugs-in-pediatric-resuscitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary drugs in pediatric resuscitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MAINTENANCE OF CARDIAC OUTPUT AND PERFUSION PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial blood pressure is the product of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74895\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74895 \">figure 1</a>). Cardiac output is the volume of blood ejected by the heart each minute; it is the product of heart rate and stroke volume. The stroke volume is the volume of blood ejected by the ventricles with each contraction; it may be reduced by inadequate intravascular volume, myocardial dysfunction, or excessive systemic or pulmonary vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cardiac output declines if either heart rate or stroke volume decrease without a commensurate increase in the other component.</p><p>During childhood, the heart rate is faster and the stroke volume is smaller than during adulthood. In children, particularly in infants, cardiac output is increased primarily by increasing the heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Heart rate and blood pressure are the only variables affecting cardiac output that can be directly and noninvasively measured. Stroke volume may be indirectly assessed by examining the volume and strength of the pulses. Systemic vascular resistance may be estimated by evaluating skin perfusion. Examination of the jugular veins to estimate venous pressure also may be useful in assessing the volume status in older children and adolescents. However, because low values may be normal, this technique is most useful in distinguishing among the causes of generalized edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-edema-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Distribution of edema and central venous pressure'</a>.)</p><p>Tachycardia and prolonged capillary refill are clinical manifestations of compensatory mechanisms designed to maintain a normal arterial perfusion pressure in the face of cardiopulmonary compromise. However, these compensatory mechanisms can be maintained only until cardiac reserve is depleted. Systemic vasoconstriction increases left ventricular afterload and myocardial oxygen consumption. Tachycardia, which also increases myocardial oxygen consumption, can be marked in an ill child. Hypotension is a late and often sudden sign of cardiovascular decompensation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74944 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MENTAL STATUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Change in the level of consciousness of a child may indicate decreased cerebral oxygenation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perfusion or may be caused by direct cerebral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Decreasing levels of consciousness can be described by the AVPU classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this system, the child may be described as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A: A</strong>wake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>V: </strong>Responsive to <strong>V</strong>oice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>P: </strong>Responsive only to <strong>P</strong>ain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>U: U</strong>nresponsive</p><p/><p>More profound degrees of hypoperfusion produce greater changes in the level of consciousness.</p><p>An altered level of consciousness indicates the need for immediate evaluation of the child's oxygenation, ventilation, and perfusion status. Signs of diminished perfusion to the brain include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lethargy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agitation</p><p/><p>Parents may be the first to recognize these signs but may be unable to describe them other than to say something is wrong. Failure of a child to recognize or respond to his or her parents or to respond to a painful stimulus is an ominous sign.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN EXAMINATION AND CAPILLARY REFILL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The skin is a reliable organ for assessment of systemic perfusion because it is an indicator of systemic vascular resistance and the degree of shunting that is necessary to maintain blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nail beds, mucous membranes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet are pink and warm in a child with normal cardiorespiratory function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin may become cool, pale, mottled, or ashen if hypoxia or poor perfusion develops.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cooling of the skin begins peripherally and extends proximally when cardiac output decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Capillary refill is a valuable initial physiologic parameter that can be evaluated more often than can other vital signs. The extremity should be lifted slightly above the level of the heart to ensure assessment of arteriolar capillary refill and not venous stasis. Light pressure is applied to blanch the fingernail bed. The pressure is released and the amount of time until color returns is measured. Normal is less than two seconds. Volume depletion or hypotension can delay capillary refill for more than three seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The usefulness of capillary refill is limited by interobserver variability and by the effect of environmental temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Prolongation of capillary refill can be induced in children with normal circulatory status by placing them in a cool environment such as an air-conditioned room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PULSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of perfusion includes assessment of the rate, strength, and regularity of the central and peripheral pulses. The carotid, axillary, brachial, radial, femoral, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses are readily palpable in healthy infants and children.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The carotid artery, on the side of the neck, is the most accessible artery to palpate in children older than one year of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The short, chubby necks of children younger than one year of age render rapid location of the carotid artery difficult. Thus, palpation of the brachial artery is recommended in the rapid cardiopulmonary assessment of infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Healthcare professionals also may palpate the femoral pulse.</p><p/><p>The apical precordial impulse is not considered to be a &quot;pulse.&quot; Heart sounds that are heard over the apex of the heart represent electrical activity that may not be adequate to produce a perfusing pulse. Alternatively, the child's precordium may be quiet, and a precordial impulse may not be palpated despite the presence of satisfactory cardiac function and a strong central pulse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of pulses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulses should be assessed bilaterally for volume, rate, and regularity. The volume of a pulse is related to pulse pressure, defined as the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The pulse pressure narrows when cardiac output decreases, rendering the pulse thready and difficult to feel. An exception may occur in early septic shock. Septic shock is a high cardiac output state characterized by a wide pulse pressure and bounding pulses caused by rapid runoff associated with systemic vasodilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A rapid pulse is a nonspecific clinical sign of distress and may result from stress (anxiety, pain, fear), fever, infection, medications, hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypovolemia, or cardiac impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/1,2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,5</a>]. The development of bradycardia in a child with cardiorespiratory distress is a late sign, usually indicating that arrest is imminent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The pulse rates in infants and children vary depending on age; familiarity with normal rates for age is needed to determine if a child requires a resuscitative intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>An irregular pulse usually is a warning of cardiac dysrhythmia. It is somewhat uncommon in previously healthy infants and children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral versus central pulses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A discrepancy between central (carotid, brachial, femoral) and peripheral (radial, dorsalis pedis) pulses may be caused by vasoconstriction associated with a cold ambient temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or it may be an early sign of decreased cardiac output and diminished peripheral perfusion.</p><p>Absence of appreciable peripheral pulses does not always equate with cardiac arrest. Two studies have shown the difficulty that parents and laypersons have in identifying peripheral pulses in healthy children, even shortly after being taught to do so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. Even healthcare providers may over-diagnose pulselessness. Children with hypothermia or a prolonged arrest treated with high doses of vasopressors may not have palpable peripheral pulses despite return of spontaneous circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Absence of central pulses indicates ineffective or absent cardiac contractions and signifies the need for immediate resuscitative action.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate blood pressure cuff size is essential for accurate blood pressure measurement. The inflatable rubber bladder should be long enough to encircle the entire circumference of the arm (overlap is acceptable) and should be wide enough to cover approximately 75 percent of the upper arm between the top of the shoulder and the olecranon. A cuff that is too narrow may result in a falsely elevated reading. Normal blood pressure values according to age are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51186\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51186 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median (50th percentile) systolic blood pressure for children older than one year can be approximated with following formula: 90 mmHg + (2 x age in years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lower limit (5th percentile) of systolic blood pressure can be approximated with the following formula: 70 mmHg + (2 x age in years).</p><p/><p>Hypotension is a late finding in children with cardiopulmonary compromise, and heralds the onset of hypotensive shock; even mild hypotension must be treated aggressively because cardiopulmonary arrest may be imminent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The blood pressure of the child with compensated shock may be normal; signs of inadequate perfusion such as decreased level of consciousness, prolonged capillary refill, and tachycardia are typically observed before hypotension is seen.
