However, in approximately one-third of people with epilepsy, medications do not completely control seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The seizures that occur in these patients are referred to as refractory or drug-resistant.</p><p>In patients with refractory epilepsy, various combinations of antiseizure medications may be tried. Although combination therapy may help to reduce the total number of seizures, polypharmacy often leads to an increased number of side effects. Nonpharmacologic options are therefore an important component of the overall therapeutic approach to refractory epilepsy. One such option is vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy; others include epilepsy surgery, ketogenic diet, and responsive neurostimulation. Among these, epilepsy surgery is the only potentially curative option. Neuromodulatory options, including VNS, are appropriate to consider in patients who are not candidates for resective epilepsy surgery.</p><p>This topic reviews the relevant anatomy, possible mechanisms of action, and clinical results of VNS in patients with epilepsy. Other aspects of epilepsy treatment in both children and adults are discussed separately.

The approval was based largely on two pivotal randomized trials in this patient population (see <a href=\"#H1114788478\" class=\"local\">'Focal epilepsy'</a> below). In Europe, VNS is approved, unrestricted by age, as adjunctive therapy for patients whose epileptic disorder is dominated by focal seizures (with or without secondary generalization) or generalized seizures that are refractory to antiseizure medications.</p><p>Although there are limited randomized studies in other age groups and seizure types, observational studies reviewed below suggest that the benefits of VNS may extend to a broad range of seizure types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The effectiveness of VNS does not appear to vary significantly based on age, neurologic comorbidity, cause of epilepsy, location of the brain from which seizure arise, or epilepsy syndrome.</p><p>Identification of factors that accurately predict a clinical response to VNS has been elusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Although VNS is effective for seizures that originate from any lobe of the brain, one study found that seizures arising from the frontal lobes responded better than seizures arising from the temporal region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Other studies have suggested that VNS may be more effective in patients who have had epilepsy for a shorter period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and in patients with seizures beginning after one year of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/32,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,39,40</a>]. Earlier age of epilepsy onset is also a predictor of medical intractability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Further studies are needed to identify predictive factors associated with a response to VNS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1114788478\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal epilepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two multicenter, blinded, randomized trials in patients 12 years of age and older with refractory focal epilepsy (more than six seizures per month) have found that active, high-intensity VNS stimulation improves seizure outcomes compared with low-intensity control stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/42-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-47</a>]. In both trials, patients were treated with a mean of two antiseizure drugs at study entry; these were not adjusted during the study period. The primary efficacy measure was the percentage change in seizure frequency during VNS treatment (measured over 12 weeks, two weeks after implantation) compared with a 12-week preimplantation baseline.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the E03 study, 114 patients with predominantly focal seizures were enrolled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The high-stimulation group experienced a greater mean reduction in seizure frequency compared with the low-stimulation group (24.5 versus 6.1 percent). More patients in the high-stimulation group experienced a greater than 50 percent reduction in seizures (31 versus 13 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the E05 study, 199 patients with complex partial or secondarily generalized seizures were enrolled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The mean reduction in seizure frequency was greater in the high-stimulation group (28 versus 15 percent). A greater than 75 percent reduction in seizures was achieved in more patients in the high-stimulation group (11 versus 2 percent).</p><p/><p>Patients in both studies, as well as 124 other patients who received VNS on a compassionate-use basis, were followed for an additional 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. All patients received high-stimulation VNS. Median seizure reductions compared with baseline appeared even greater than in the controlled portion of the studies: 34 percent at three months and 45 percent at 12 months. At 12 months, 20 percent of patients achieved seizure reduction of greater than 75 percent.</p><p>These and other open-label studies suggest that the efficacy of VNS may improve over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/33,51-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,51-57</a>]. However, these results should be interpreted with some caution; there were no control groups in these studies. Further, antiseizure drug adjustments, permitted during some of these observational studies, may have contributed to improved seizure control.</p><p>A third study, referred to as the PULSE trial, was stopped early due to slow recruitment after 112 out of a planned 362 patients were enrolled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. PULSE was an open-label randomized trial comparing VNS plus best medical practice (BMP) with BMP alone in adults with refractory focal seizures. In 96 analyzed patients, there were significant between-group differences in favor of VNS plus BMP on measures of quality of life and seizure frequency. Although a greater number of patients in the VNS plus BMP group reported adverse events (43 versus 21 percent), the adverse effects were mostly transient and related to VNS implantation or stimulation. (See <a href=\"#H2293089360\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and complications'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], multiple large case series have reported responder rates (&gt;50 percent reduction of seizures) of 50 to 64 percent in patients implanted with VNS with a follow up time ranging from one to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/33,36,38,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36,38,59,60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H758561088\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized epilepsies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case series suggest that VNS is also effective in generalized epilepsy syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/32,36,40,54,59,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36,40,54,59,61</a>]. While some studies have found that symptomatic generalized epilepsy is more responsive to VNS than idiopathic syndromes, others have reported the opposite or found no difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/32,54,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,54,62,63</a>]. In one of the early randomized trials of VNS, 24 patients had refractory idiopathic generalized epilepsy, and there was a 46 percent median reduction of seizures in this group after three months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>A relatively large accumulation of clinical experience with VNS in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is due in part to the fact that seizures are often medically intractable, and surgical treatment options are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/61-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-72</a>]. VNS appears to be very effective in this patient group, leading to a greater than 50 percent reduction in seizure frequency in approximately two-thirds of patients, shortened seizure duration, and a median reduction of one prescribed antiseizure drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. VNS may be particularly effective at reducing atonic and tonic seizures in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;, section on 'Lennox-Gastaut syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Other refractory epilepsies with onset in childhood also appear to respond to VNS in uncontrolled case series; these include epileptic encephalopathies (eg, Landau Kleffner syndrome), severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, Dravet syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, and atypical absence epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/32,39,54,61-68,73-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,39,54,61-68,73-77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3172512509\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to small studies reviewed above in children with specific epilepsy syndromes such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, one randomized study and multiple observational studies have examined the efficacy and tolerability of VNS in children.</p><p>In the only randomized study to date, 41 children (mean age 11 years, range 3 to 17 years), most with intractable focal epilepsy, were randomized to high-output stimulation versus low-output (control) stimulation and followed for 20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. At the end of the blinded randomized treatment phase, the proportion of patients achieving 50 percent or greater reduction in seizure frequency was similar between groups (16 percent in the high-stimulation group versus 21 percent in the low-stimulation group). After a 19-week unblinded add-on phase during which 34 children all received high-output stimulation, 26 percent of patients achieved a 50 percent or greater reduction in seizure frequency and 94 percent of parents or guardians reported positive qualitative effects of treatment.</p><p>These results contrast with many prior observational studies that suggested that VNS was similarly effective in children compared with adolescents and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/36,39,40,61,79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,39,40,61,79,80</a>]. In a 2013 pooled analysis of 14 observational studies that included 481 children, the responder rate (&gt;50 percent seizure reduction) associated with VNS was 55 percent, and the pooled seizure freedom rate was 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A multicenter retrospective study of 347 children not included in the 2013 pooled analysis found responder rates after VNS of 33, 38, and 44 percent at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the discrepancy between the randomized and observational data in children. Some have suggested that the randomized study was under-powered or too short to see the full impact of VNS, since data in adults suggest that improvement may only be seen after a year or longer of stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Alternatively, differences in electrophysiology and incomplete maturation of the vagus nerve in children compared to adults could impact the effectiveness of stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In other reports, VNS has been used with success in children as young as 11 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3230020137\"><span class=\"h2\">Older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experience with VNS in older patients with epilepsy is limited. The subset of 45 patients in the EO3 and EO5 trials reviewed above who were 50 years of age or older experienced a benefit similar to the population as a whole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, only eight of these patients were older than 60 years.

In a VNS registry study, the response was favorable but somewhat less so in the 591 surgical patients compared with the 2382 nonsurgical patients; median reduction in seizure frequencies at 3 and 12 months were 43 versus 47 percent and 46 versus 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. While some case series have suggested that the outcomes with VNS may be more favorable in the post-callosotomy group, the VNS registry data suggest that at 12 months, response rates are similar in these two groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2389442225\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baseline cardiac conduction disorders are generally considered a contraindication to vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy, given the potential for efferent conduction through the vagus nerve, particularly on the right, to worsen cardiac conduction abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H3108838697\" class=\"local\">'Bradycardia'</a> below.)</p><p>Sleep apnea is a relative contraindication for VNS, based on observations that the number of apneas and hypopneas may rise with high-intensity stimulation among patients with preexisting sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3089946674\" class=\"local\">'Sleep apnea'</a> below.) </p><p>There are reports that programmable shunt valves can be affected by use of the VNS magnet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. VNS stimulation using the magnet should probably be avoided in individuals with programmable shunts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2347896855\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVICE SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a battery-powered device similar to a cardiac pacemaker. In most models, stimulating leads are surgically placed around the left vagus nerve in the carotid sheath and are connected to an infraclavicular subcutaneous programmable pacemaker (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69707\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69707 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Because the right vagus nerve provides more innervation to the cardiac atria than the left vagus nerve, electrical stimulation of the left vagus nerve is generally used in clinical practice to avoid adverse cardiac effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. However, right-sided VNS has been reported safe in at least one case series, and in animal studies it appears equally effective against seizures as left-sided stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2254773391\"><span class=\"h2\">Responsive devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A VNS model that provides responsive stimulation to increases in heart rate that are often associated with seizures was approved by the FDA in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The responsive stimulation occurs in addition to the automatic intermittent stimulation and in addition to the on-demand stimulation when the patient uses the magnet. It is not yet known whether responsive models are more effective than non-responsive models, and the design of the trials that have been performed does not allow for direct comparison.</p><p>The rationale for the model is the observation that up to 80 percent of patients experience an acceleration of heart rate when a seizure occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The automated stimulation function of this VNS model detects these heart rate changes and automatically responds by sending a programmed stimulation to the vagus nerve. Both seizure-related and non-seizure related increases in heart rate may trigger stimulation.</p><p>In a multicenter unblinded trial of 20 patients with refractory focal epilepsy who underwent placement of heart-rate responsive VNS, a total of 89 seizures occurred while patients were continuously monitored over three to five days in an epilepsy monitoring unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Overall, 43 percent of seizures were associated with &ge;20 percent rise in heart rate, 35 percent of seizures received automated stimulation, and 21 percent of seizures stopped during automated stimulation (median duration from stimulation to seizure end, 35 seconds). Responder rates (&ge;50 percent reduction in seizures per month compared with baseline) at 3, 6, and 12 months were 20, 35, and 50 percent, respectively. The mean duty cycle increased from 11 to 16 percent at six months, which represents approximately five additional stimulations per hour compared with standard, non-responsive settings.</p><p>The device is relatively new, and selection criteria and predictors of benefit have not been established. Pending further data and clinical experience, a heart-rate responsive VNS model may be considered in patients who have documented tachycardia at the onset of seizures and who are not expected to be able to apply on-demand stimulation with the magnet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2205978958\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninvasive systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An entirely noninvasive, transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulator has been in use in Europe.

However, some patients are able to reduce one or more drugs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> doses, and a few patients are seizure free with VNS and no antiseizure drug treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy/abstract/32,157\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,157</a>].</p><p>There is limited information regarding the frequency of this outcome.

Eligible patients with medically refractory epilepsy are more likely to achieve seizure remission with epilepsy surgery than with other treatment modalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a battery-powered device similar to a cardiac pacemaker. Stimulating leads are surgically placed around the left vagus nerve in the carotid sheath (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69707\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69707 \">figure 1</a>). VNS has multiple antiseizure properties, but the exact mechanisms of effect remain unclear. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of effect'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VNS is a valid treatment option for patients with medically refractory epilepsy. This includes patients who are not candidates for resective surgery, those who opt not to undergo brain surgery, and those whose seizures persist after resective epilepsy surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3221464953\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Controlled trials in individuals greater than 12 years of age with focal epilepsy indicate that 30 to 40 percent achieve a greater than 50 percent reduction in seizure frequency. Open-label studies suggest that these benefits may increase over time and adjustment of parameter settings. (See <a href=\"#H1114788478\" class=\"local\">'Focal epilepsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are conflicting data on the efficacy of VNS in younger children. Most open-label studies suggest that younger children and individuals with other seizure types and epilepsy syndromes (eg, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) can benefit from VNS. However, a single, small, randomized study found no benefit of VNS compared with low-stimulation control in patients 3 to 17 years in age. (See <a href=\"#H758561088\" class=\"local\">'Generalized epilepsies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3172512509\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects that occur during stimulation in a minority of patients are usually mild to moderate in severity and diminish with time or reduction in stimulation intensity. These include voice alteration and tingling. (See <a href=\"#H2076237156\" class=\"local\">'Voice alteration and other common side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious adverse events are rare and include infections, cardiac arrhythmias, and aspiration. Infections may be more common in children than adults. (See <a href=\"#H2293089360\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with VNS is limited to brain MRI under specific conditions outlined by the manufacturer.
