A successful kidney transplant improves the quality of life and reduces the mortality risk for most patients when compared with maintenance dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, patients require close follow-up after transplantation since they are on complex immunosuppressive regimens that render them susceptible to infection, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In addition, patients often have multiple comorbidities due to, or as a cause of, their underlying end-stage renal disease.</p><p>Whereas patients are generally followed by a transplant specialist for the first three to six months following transplant, thereafter they may be seen primarily by a general nephrologist or internist who is often able to address existing comorbidities. Whether a patient is followed by a transplant nephrologist, general nephrologist, or internist often depends upon the availability of services in proximity to the patient. While many believe that transplant nephrologists should be directly involved in the care of transplant recipients for the life of the graft, this is often not practical. However, communication between the internist or community-based nephrologist and the transplant center is important for optimal care of the patient.</p><p>This topic reviews the general medical care of the kidney transplant recipient including recommendations for monitoring allograft function and minimizing the risk of infections, malignancies, bone disease, CVD, and diabetes.

The frequency of follow-up varies among centers and depends upon the stability of the patient. At our center, renal transplant recipients are seen in the transplant clinic twice weekly for the first two to four weeks posttransplant, then weekly for one month, then every two weeks for one month, and then every three months for the first year after transplantation. Immunosuppressive therapy is gradually reduced during the first three to six months to avoid adverse medication effects while still preventing rejection.</p><p>Beyond 6 to 12 months, patients may be followed by an internist or general nephrologist in consultation with a transplant nephrologist since the risks of complications such as rejection are thought to have decreased beyond this time. Patients continue to require close monitoring to ensure that the graft is functioning optimally and to assess for complications due to side effects of immunosuppressive medications, such as infection, malignancy, and diabetes. In addition, patients may have complications of reduced renal function, such as anemia and bone disease. Kidney transplant recipients are at high risk for cardiovascular complications because of their reduced renal function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus.</p><p>The type and frequency of laboratory testing vary from center to center. A typical monitoring scheme, which is generally consistent with the 2009 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80400\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80400 \">table 1</a>).

Reasons for the modest decrease in GFR include the transplantation of a single kidney; donor-recipient size mismatch; ischemic injury (especially in the case of deceased-donor kidneys); the use of expanded-criteria donors (in which less than optimal kidneys are accepted for transplantation); and the use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), which cause renal vasoconstriction.</p><p>The evaluation and diagnosis of the renal transplant recipient with an elevated or increasing serum creatinine is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Proteinuria may also suggest acute allograft rejection, transplant glomerulopathy, or de novo or recurrent disease.

The method of screening varies among transplant centers. Some centers measure spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratios among all patients, whereas others obtain urinalyses in all patients and measure spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratios only in those who have greater than trace proteinuria on urinalysis. Among patients with a history of proteinuric kidney disease, spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratios may be checked more frequently to monitor for recurrence of the original glomerular disease. A renal biopsy is often necessary to determine the cause of proteinuria.

The ability to predict the cause of allograft dysfunction without a biopsy is notoriously low. (See <a href=\"#H1769728797\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring renal allograft function'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Some centers perform surveillance biopsies on all renal transplant patients at regular intervals, whereas others do surveillance biopsies on all high-risk recipients, such as those with a history of BK virus, those at higher risk for recurrent disease or rejection, or highly sensitized patients.</p><p>The risks of an allograft biopsy include bleeding, damage to other organs, infection, and loss of the allograft. Studies have reported a very low major complication rate (including transfusion requirement and catheterization) of between 0.4 and 1.0 percent, with only one graft lost in approximately 2500 biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The threshold for renal transplant biopsy should be low since the procedure is relatively safe as long as the right precautions are taken. The biopsy should be done at a transplant center and read by an experienced transplant pathologist.

Immunosuppressive therapy can be divided into induction and maintenance regimens. Induction therapy is administered at or around the time of transplantation and is associated with greater immunosuppression than maintenance therapy. The goals of induction therapy are to prevent acute rejection and to permit minimization or avoidance of maintenance immunosuppressive agents that are known to cause toxicity. Induction therapy typically consists of biologic antibodies (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a>) and high-dose glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Maintenance immunosuppression is usually initiated at the time of transplantation and continued long-term for the duration of the allograft. Maintenance regimens can include glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>), antimetabolic agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>), mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>), or costimulatory blockade agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=belatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">belatacept</a>). These agents differ with respect to their efficacy and side effect profile (including risk of infections, malignancy, cardiovascular disease [CVD], and posttransplant diabetes [PTDM]), and these factors must be considered when choosing a regimen for a particular patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, over 90 percent of transplant recipients were on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, and 70 percent were on glucocorticoids, at one year posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Some centers try to reduce glucocorticoids or use glucocorticoid-free protocols among patients who have received induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].<strong> </strong>Such an approach may have a beneficial impact on blood pressure, glycemic control, bone disease, and lipid profiles. However, glucocorticoid-free protocols may increase the risk of chronic rejection, and therefore, we generally continue low-dose glucocorticoids indefinitely among most patients. This issue is discussed in depth elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-renal-transplantation-in-adults#H177628256\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation in adults&quot;, section on 'Dosing of glucocorticoids'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withdrawal-or-avoidance-of-glucocorticoids-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withdrawal or avoidance of glucocorticoids after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After 6 to 12 months, immunosuppression regimens are generally stably maintained unless there is a specific reason, such as infection, malignancy, or drug toxicity or adverse effects, to reduce immunosuppression further.

The prolonged use of CNIs may cause permanent fibrosis in the kidney. As discussed above, CNI concentrations should be checked at regular intervals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H25669040\" class=\"local\">'Routine follow-up and laboratory monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus#H2121343288\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus&quot;, section on 'Drug monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>An elevated CNI concentration that is reported as a result of routine testing requires prompt evaluation. Since the CNI concentration should reflect a 12-hour trough or two-hour postdose (C2) level, it should first be confirmed that the blood was drawn at the correct time. If the blood was drawn correctly, other causes should be considered, such as the patient taking the incorrect dose or a change in preparation of the immunosuppressive agent (since generic forms of the medication may not be exactly equivalent).

The most effective safe form of contraception should be used to avoid unplanned pregnancies in transplant recipients. The optimal form of contraception for transplant recipients is not known. Among uncomplicated solid organ transplant recipients (except those with Budd-Chiari syndrome), the 2016 United States Medical Eligibility Criteria (USMEC) for Contraceptive Use suggest the use of combined <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> contraceptives (oral, patch, or vaginal ring), progestin-only oral contraceptives, depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (DMPA) injections, etonogestrel implants, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs), or copper IUDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In complicated solid organ transplant recipients (eg, those with acute or chronic graft failure, rejection, or cardiac allograft vasculopathy), progestin-only oral contraceptives, DMPA injections, and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are preferred. Patients who should not receive estrogen should be offered progestin-only formulations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives#H3033285\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.) </p><p>As discussed above, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">mofetil/sodium</span> and mTOR inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>) are teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy. Thus, all female transplant recipients receiving these agents should be counseled about and receive contraception. In patients who subsequently would like to become pregnant, contraception should be continued until the immunosuppressive regimen has been modified, therapeutic levels of the new regimen have been achieved, and graft function has been monitored for a period of at least three months before attempting conception.

Patients require close follow-up after transplantation since they are on complex immunosuppressive regimens that render them susceptible to infection, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In addition, patients often have multiple comorbidities due to, or as a cause of, their underlying end-stage renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H25669033\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25669040\" class=\"local\">'Routine follow-up and laboratory monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections such as upper respiratory or urinary tract infection are common in renal transplant recipients. Decongestants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents should be avoided. Patients are also at risk for opportunistic infections including cytomegalovirus (CMV), <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly carinii) pneumonia (PCP), and polyomavirus (BK and John Cunningham [JC] virus). (See <a href=\"#H1064919645\" class=\"local\">'Infectious issues and complications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CVD is the major cause of death and graft loss in diabetic renal transplant recipients. Potentially modifiable risk factors for CVD such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity should be addressed. Some risk factors are caused or exacerbated by immunosuppressive medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the renal transplant recipient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H56061947\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus commonly develops within the first few months posttransplant, but there is continued risk for the life of the patient and transplant. Patients should be screened with a fasting blood glucose weekly for the first four months after transplantation, and then at three and six months and annually thereafter. A hemoglobin A1c can be checked starting at three months posttransplant in lieu of fasting plasma glucose if these levels are difficult to obtain. (See <a href=\"#H3015095993\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes mellitus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone disease is common following renal transplantation. Patients should be regularly monitored for hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, hypercalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. In addition, renal transplant recipients should undergo assessment of bone mineral density pretransplant, with subsequent monitoring dependent upon whether the patient has evidence of osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"#H2939552679\" class=\"local\">'Bone metabolism and disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-hyperparathyroidism-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent hyperparathyroidism after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer is more common among transplant recipients than in the general population. Renal transplant patients should have the same routine cancer screenings as those recommended for the general population, except for skin cancer screenings, which should be performed monthly by self-skin examinations, with total-body skin examinations completed every six months to yearly by expert clinicians and dermatologists. (See <a href=\"#H2979947579\" class=\"local\">'Malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy in a transplant recipient is considered high risk. The major risks to the patient include the risk of rejection and allograft failure. The major risks to the developing fetus include the effects of immunosuppressive medications and risk of transmission of infection. All immunosuppressive medications carry some risk in pregnancy; in particular, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">mofetil/sodium</span> and the mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors should be avoided starting six weeks prior to conception. The most effective safe form of contraception should be used to avoid unplanned pregnancies in transplant recipients.
