Mutations in these genes are implicated in about 15 percent of women with familial breast cancer and a similar proportion of all women with incident ovarian cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Less commonly, increased risks for breast cancer are associated with other hereditary conditions, such as Li-Fraumeni and Cowden syndromes, which are related to mutations in the <em>TP53</em> and <em>PTEN </em>genes, respectively (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pten-hamartoma-tumor-syndrome-including-cowden-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, including Cowden syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=li-fraumeni-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&quot;</a>). In addition, mutations in other genes such as <em>PALB2 </em>and <em>CHEK2 </em>are associated with significantly increased risks of breast cancer (so called &quot;moderate-risk&quot; gene mutations).</p><p>Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer attributable to <em>BRCA</em> mutations is characterized by an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance, markedly increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer, with an especially early onset of breast cancer, and an increased incidence of tumors of other organs, such as the fallopian tubes, prostate, male breast, and pancreas. However, not all patients with a family history of breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ovarian cancer are found to have a hereditary basis of their familial disease. This topic discusses the management of patients with mutations in <em>BRCA</em> and moderate-risk genes, as well as those with familial breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ovarian cancer who received negative or uninformative genetic testing results.</p><p>The selection of patients who should be offered genetic risk evaluation is discussed elsewhere.

In addition, management for individuals with well-defined high-risk syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartoma tumor syndrome is also discussed separately.

Studies show that BSO significantly reduces the risk of ovarian cancer. (See <a href=\"#H373708773\" class=\"local\">'Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Specific recommendations for breast cancer risk management include intensive screening as well as consideration of hormonal and surgical forms of risk reduction. In addition to bilateral mastectomy, premenopausal women should be informed that obtaining BSO by the recommended age may significantly reduce the risk of breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H373708411\" class=\"local\">'Risk-reducing surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>For men, screening for breast and prostate cancers is generally recommended. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H713897798\"><span class=\"h2\">Approaching decisions about management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical decision-making around which strategies to pursue for cancer risk-reduction (ie, surveillance, risk-reducing surgery, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemoprevention) involve a trade-off between life expectancy and quality of life.</p><p>Several studies have suggested that decision aids or data from models may help patients choose among different options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>], and most use decision analysis and the concept of time tradeoffs (ie, years of life saved by one strategy as compared with another). While useful from a clinical research standpoint, they are not often employed in clinical practice.</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calculations from one model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] suggested that an average 30-year-old woman with a <em>BRCA</em> mutation would gain from three to five years of life expectancy from prophylactic mastectomy and from 0.3 to 2 years of life expectancy from risk-reducing oophorectomy, depending on her cumulative risk of cancer. In contrast, gains in life expectancy declined with age at the time of risk-reducing surgery and were minimal for 60-year-old women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calculations from a different model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] that compared risk-reducing surgery with surveillance suggested that prophylactic mastectomy at age 25 plus BSO at age 40 years maximized survival probability. However, substituting mammography plus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening for prophylactic mastectomy seemed to offer comparable survival.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H373708411\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk-reducing surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women without a personal history of cancer who have a <em>BRCA </em>mutation, prophylactic (or preventative) surgery reduces the risk of developing cancer. However, risk-reducing surgery does not completely eliminate the risk of developing cancer as residual risks remain after mastectomy and oophorectomy. While prophylactic surgery is effective in cancer risk reduction, women should be counseled preoperatively about the potential morbidity of such procedures, and the possibility that surgery may affect libido, sexual functioning, and body image. Oophorectomy in premenopausal women can be associated with increased risks for bone and heart disease, and raises concerns about how to optimally manage surgical menopause and hormone therapy. These procedures are discussed further below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H373708417\"><span class=\"h3\">Mastectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and recommend that <em>BRCA</em> carriers be offered prophylactic bilateral mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the decision about whether or not to undergo such surgery is based on personal preference, given that effective screening is available.</p><p>In both retrospective and prospective observational studies, risk-reducing or prophylactic bilateral mastectomy decreases the incidence of breast cancer by as much as 90 percent or more in patients at risk of hereditary breast cancer, with most studies focusing on <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/9-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-17</a>]. As an example, in one large, prospective, multi-institutional international study that included over 2400 women with a known <em>BRCA</em> mutation, no patients developed breast cancer following mastectomy (0 of 247 women), whereas 98 of 1372 women (7 percent) who did not undergo mastectomy did [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Patients who opt to proceed with mastectomy should undergo a bilateral total mastectomy rather than a subcutaneous mastectomy because the latter leaves behind more glandular tissue that remains at risk for future cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>]. However, skin-sparing mastectomy with or without preservation of the nipple-areolar complex followed by immediate breast reconstruction is increasingly being performed as it provides superior cosmetic results.</p><p>One review of 150 women with a <em>BRCA</em> mutation and no personal history of cancer who underwent skin-sparing mastectomy at two large United States institutions demonstrated incidental cancers in 2.7 percent. In addition, one cancer event was noted at a median follow-up of 33 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although longer follow-up of these women is needed, this procedure is considered to be an acceptable option for risk reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, a 2015 analysis suggested that the breast cancer risk reduction attributed to BSO might be overstated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Using a nationwide cohort of over 800 women with a<em> BRCA</em> mutation and no prior personal history of cancer, the hazard ratio for breast cancer following BSO was 1.09 (95% CI 0.67-1.77). In contrast to other studies, this analysis aimed to incorporate the variable of person-time to control for potential lead-time bias. However, the study follow-up was short at only 3.2 years. The authors did suggest that two major types of bias may have influenced the findings from older studies: cancer-induced testing bias and immortal person-time&nbsp;bias. However, the authors do suggest that BSO, when performed prior to menopause, may have a slight protective effect on breast cancer risk. While the findings from this study do not prove that BSO does not reduce the risk for breast cancer, it does cause us to be more cautious when counseling patients about a protective effect of BSO on breast cancer risk.

Moreover, there are no national guidelines that recommend routine hysterectomy in <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers.</p><p>There has been considerable debate about whether mutation carriers should undergo hysterectomy at the time of BSO. Few high-quality data exist, but the limited information suggests there is no increased risk of endometrial cancers. For example, one study that included over 3000 women with a <em>BRCA</em> mutation found only 17 uterine cancers, and most were attributable to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> use in whom the ten-year absolute risk was 2.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. While this and other studies have also reported a possible small excess risk of uterine cancers in mutation carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], the absolute risk is low and it is not clear that the benefits associated with hysterectomy are sufficiently large enough to warrant the risks associated with surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H713898029\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormone replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pre- and perimenopausal women who undergo BSO will likely experience side effects of surgically induced menopause. Given their relatively young age, there is concern regarding the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on breast cancer risk. A prospective cohort study of 462 <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers included 139 who underwent BSO, 89 of whom took some form of HRT and 50 who did not take HRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. HRT did not negate the beneficial effect of BSO on breast cancer risk. An updated analysis of these data included almost 1300 women and showed similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/15,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,31</a>]. Despite these reported results, they are all limited by small numbers, by lack of data on type of HRT and duration of use, and possibly by analytic biases. Nonetheless, they consistently demonstrate there is no negative impact on cancer rates after BSO associated with HRT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of menopausal symptoms with hormone therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although data are limited, it has become commonplace to offer carriers HRT from the time of BSO until about age 50, particularly for those undergoing risk-reducing mastectomy. Of note, women should be counseled about the availability of different hormonal medications, doses, and methods of delivery (eg, patch, pill, vaginal cream). It is critical to have at least an initial discussion about these options preoperatively and to be aware that not all women require or desire hormonal therapy to manage menopausal symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H373709230\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternatives to BSO?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only proven risk-reducing procedure for ovarian cancer in <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers is BSO. However, there is controversy about whether it is appropriate to perform a salpingectomy alone for <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers who wish to defer oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], based upon a possible fallopian tube origin for some ovarian cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

However, the statement and a lengthier explication make clear that this procedure does <strong>not</strong> eliminate the risk of ovarian cancer, and it does <strong>not</strong> reduce the risk of breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/32,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,35</a>]. Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network thus indicate that &quot;salpingectomy alone is not the standard of care and is discouraged outside a clinical trial&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Until there are sufficient data from randomized control trials or prospective studies to support salpingectomy as an effective risk-reducing procedure for <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers, we recommend against salpingectomy without an oophorectomy for these women.

Men with <em>BRCA </em>mutations have increased risk for breast and prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a known <em>BRCA</em> mutation, risk-reducing mastectomy is a highly effective strategy for breast cancer risk reduction. For <em>BRCA</em> carriers diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer, we prefer not proceeding with risk-reducing mastectomies until at least five years after the ovarian cancer diagnosis, as survival is dominated by the mortality rate of ovarian cancer. (See <a href=\"#H373708417\" class=\"local\">'Mastectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a <em>BRCA</em> mutation, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is indicated by age 35 to 40 and when childbearing is completed. BSO is also indicated for carriers who are diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H373708773\" class=\"local\">'Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with a <em>BRCA</em> mutation who do not opt for bilateral mastectomy should undergo breast cancer surveillance with annual mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"#H779411428\" class=\"local\">'Cancer surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a <em>BRCA</em> mutation who do not opt for risk-reducing mastectomy, chemoprevention with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a>, or an aromatase inhibitor is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Chemoprevention'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who carry mutations in genes other than <em>BRCA</em> that confer moderate risk for breast cancer (eg, <em>PALB2</em>, <em>CHEK2</em>, and <em>ATM </em>gene mutations), the options for breast cancer prevention are similar. (See <a href=\"#H9007689\" class=\"local\">'Patients with mutations in moderate-risk/newer genes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with <em>BRCA</em> mutations, cancer surveillance options are limited but include clinical breast examination and prostate cancer screening at an earlier age. Men with evidence of gynecomastia may consider the role of mammography. (see <a href=\"#H779411428\" class=\"local\">'Cancer surveillance'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral contraceptive use in <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers decreases the risk of ovarian cancer and does not appear to increase risk of breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H713898364\" class=\"local\">'Oral contraceptives'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with negative or uninformative test results, quantitative models can help identify women with a high lifetime risk of breast cancer of at least 20 percent. These women are candidates for breast cancer screening with MRI in addition to mammography. (See <a href=\"#H1048914838\" class=\"local\">'Women at high risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with uninformative negative <em>BRCA</em> results without a family history of ovarian cancer do not appear to be at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Thus, BSO is not indicated for ovarian cancer risk reduction. (See <a href=\"#H9008160\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian cancer risk management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26548417\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and editors would like to recognize Dr. Suzanne W.
