For adults with type 1 diabetes, we aim for an A1C value of 7 percent (using an assay aligned to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT] in which the upper limit of normal is 6 percent) or lower in patients in whom the benefits outweigh the risks. Glycemic targets are generally set somewhat higher (eg, &lt;8 percent) for older patients and those with comorbidities or a limited life expectancy and little likelihood of benefit from intensive therapy. More stringent control (A1C &lt;6 percent) may be indicated for selected motivated patients with type 1 diabetes and during pregnancy.

The dose of the premeal bolus is determined by the ambient blood glucose level before the meal, the size and composition of the meal, and anticipated activity levels.</p><p>This more physiologic replacement of insulin, as opposed to previously used simpler insulin regimens, should be started as early as possible following the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Simpler regimens (eg, twice-daily injections of short-[regular] and intermediate-acting [NPH] insulin mixed together in the same syringe and given in fixed amounts before breakfast and dinner) are no longer recommended unless the patient cannot or will not comply with multiple injections or an insulin pump. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Choice of insulin delivery'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Insulin preparations'</a>.)</p><p>The DCCT showed that, compared with a simple insulin regimen, early aggressive insulin therapy helped to sustain endogenous insulin secretion, which was associated with a lower A1C and a lower risk for severe hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The DCCT and other smaller studies demonstrated that improved glycemic control with intensive insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus led to graded reductions in relatively early stages of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61305 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73143\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73143 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) follow-up study from the DCCT demonstrated that improved glycemic control with intensive insulin therapy also reduces more advanced stages of microvascular disease, as well as cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>What was considered &quot;intensive therapy&quot; in the DCCT is now considered to be standard therapy for management of type 1 diabetes.

A number of factors influence the pharmacokinetics of insulin, including the insulin preparation, size of subcutaneous depot, injection technique, site of injection, alterations in subcutaneous blood flow, and, potentially, the presence and titer of anti-insulin antibodies. These issues are reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17221653\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-monitoring of blood glucose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is an integral part of intensive diabetes therapy in type 1 diabetes. SMBG is necessary to fine-tune insulin dosing. Ideally, testing at home should be done four to seven times daily (before breakfast, mid-morning, before lunch, mid-afternoon, before the evening meal, before bedtime, and occasionally at 3 AM). Additionally, it is useful to test blood glucose levels at intervals after certain meals and before, during, and after exercise.</p><p>SMBG usually requires intermittent capillary blood sampling and the use of a glucose meter. Devices to sample the glucose continuously from interstitial fluid are also available, with ongoing development in progress. With continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), blood glucose levels are reported to the patient in real time. Because of reliability issues and the need to calibrate the devices, CGM does not eliminate the need for at least occasional fingersticks. The immediate feedback of glucose results allows timely intervention for low or decreasing glucose levels to avert serious hypoglycemic events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-management-of-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Self-monitoring of blood glucose in management of adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16545191\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes therapy in general (coordination of <span class=\"nowrap\">meals/diet,</span> activity, and frequent monitoring of blood glucose) and the intensity of insulin therapy in particular are largely dependent on self-care. Therefore, all patients with type 1 diabetes should receive ongoing self-management education and support in order to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Diabetes therapy will be successful only if the patient is fully committed to it, has good understanding of the regimen, and is supported by a health care team with sufficient enthusiasm and expertise to educate the patient and to continuously monitor his or her progress.</p><p>A good general approach to insulin management in type 1 diabetes is to begin by exploring the patient's understanding of diabetes, the effects of diet and physical activity on glucose levels and insulin dosing, blood glucose regulation, the relationship between long-term glycemic levels and diabetic complications, and the potential for increased hypoglycemia and weight gain with an optimal insulin regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16545249\"><span class=\"h3\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most important components of nutrition education is for the patient to learn to estimate how much carbohydrate they are about to consume at any meal or snack. One approach is to ask the patient to maintain a consistent carbohydrate profile in which the same amount of carbohydrate is consumed each day at any particular meal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76488\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76488 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A second, more modern approach allows for flexibility in carbohydrate consumption, matching insulin delivery to insulin requirements based upon the patient understanding the anticipated glucose excursion with meals and selecting a dose of short- (regular) or rapid-acting insulin that will control postprandial blood glucose excursions. Use of carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios can free patients from having to take a fixed amount of carbohydrate at particular meals. If they plan to eat less carbohydrate at a meal, they simply decrease the dose of prandial insulin. Patients vary considerably in how much insulin they need to cover a set amount of carbohydrate. Some patients need a different &quot;carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio&quot; at different meals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Advanced carbohydrate counting'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16545284\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incorporating regular exercise into an intensive program is helpful to avoid weight gain frequently induced by increased insulin administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. We encourage patients with diabetes to perform 30 to 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity on most days of the week. To increase adherence, the clinician should help the patient choose a type of exercise he or she will enjoy and offer regular encouragement and suggestions for overcoming barriers to exercise.</p><p>There are two aspects of exercise that are important to consider. First, the effect of exercise on blood glucose varies with the time of day and whether the person is hypoinsulinemic or hyperinsulinemic at that time. Second, late hypoglycemia can occur several hours after vigorous exercise, due to repletion of muscle glycogen stores. Adjustments to the insulin regimen before, during, and after exercise are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-exercise-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus#H24194813\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of exercise in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Managing blood glucose during exercise'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cases-illustrating-the-effects-of-exercise-in-intensive-insulin-therapy-for-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cases illustrating the effects of exercise in intensive insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16545290\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with type 1 diabetes often experience significant stress related to the many self-care responsibilities to optimize glycemic control. Assessment and management of psychosocial issues are an important component of care in patients with type 1 diabetes. Depression, anxiety (fear of hypoglycemia), and eating disorders may develop and are associated with poor glycemic control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. In adolescents and young adults, comprehensive management of diabetes that addresses these psychosocial issues can improve glycemic control and reduce hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Weight gain'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cost of intensive diabetes therapy is greater than that of conventional treatment. Based upon an analysis of the DCCT and costs from the early 1990s, the cost of intensive diabetes therapy (USD $4000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">$6000/year)</span> was approximately three times that of conventional treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The overall cost of intensive diabetes management today varies enormously depending on which insulin is used, whether an insulin pump is involved, frequency of monitoring (including CGM), and other factors. Cost remains an important disadvantage that may limit implementation of intensive diabetes therapy.</p><p/><p>In spite of these drawbacks, intensive diabetes therapy is recommended for the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491276486\"><span class=\"h1\">INSULIN REGIMENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic requirements of an optimal insulin regimen are administration of a basal level of insulin (delivered by daily or twice-daily injections of an intermediate- [NPH] or long-acting [glargine, detemir, degludec] insulin preparation or continuous subcutaneous delivery of a rapid insulin preparation [lispro, aspart, glulisine] via a pump) and premeal boluses of a short- (regular) or rapid-acting insulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73676 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Insulin preparations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of insulin delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice between multiple daily injections (MDI) and continuous subcutaneous delivery of a rapid insulin preparation via a pump is largely a matter of patient preference and lifestyle. It should be made only after both regimens are carefully explained to the patient. It may be helpful to have patients receiving continuous therapy talk with prospective patients. If available, we ask patients to wear a loaner pump (delivering saline only) for a week while continuing with their normal insulin regimen. This allows them to get a sense of what it would be like to be attached to the pump all the time.</p><p>In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), in which all supplies were free, patients in the intensive therapy group were allowed to choose between MDI or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and could switch between the two during the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Fifty-nine percent of the patients in the intensive therapy group used a pump at least part of the time; however, the pump was used for only 34 percent of the time during the study. Glycemic control, frequency of severe hypoglycemia, and progression of microvascular disease were similar with either type of insulin therapy. It should be noted that pumps have become more sophisticated since the DCCT ended in 1993.</p><p>In meta-analyses of randomized, controlled trials that compared CSII with MDI, continuous therapy resulted in slightly better glycemic control (weighted mean difference -0.2 to -0.4 percentage points) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. Many of the trials included in the meta-analyses used rapid-acting insulin analogs instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> for CSII and rapid- and long-acting insulin analogs for MDI. The impact on hypoglycemia was less certain. Although a 2008 meta-analysis showed a reduction in severe hypoglycemia with continuous insulin therapy compared with MDI, the analysis was limited by significant heterogeneity in the trial results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Small trials comparing intensive insulin therapy using MDI versus CSII reported no difference in quality-of-life measures between treatment groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>In a randomized trial published after the meta-analyses, 317 patients with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to CSII (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-aspart-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin aspart</a>) or MDI (insulins aspart and detemir) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. All patients received the same structured training in insulin usage. After 24 months, mean A1C in those patients whose baseline A1C was &ge;7.5 percent decreased in both groups (-0.85 and -0.42 percentage points, for CSII and MDI, respectively, a difference that was not significant after multivariate adjustment). There were few episodes of severe hypoglycemia, with no difference between the two groups. Pump users had greater improvement in treatment satisfaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple daily injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many different insulin regimens may be used in an MDI regimen. Some of the more common ones are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69575\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69575 \">table 2</a>). Irrespective of the type of insulin chosen, these insulin regimens should be monitored with frequent blood glucose determinations at least four times per day. (See <a href=\"#H17221653\" class=\"local\">'Self-monitoring of blood glucose'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17221891\"><span class=\"h3\">Choosing basal/prandial insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of basal (NPH, glargine, detemir, or the very-long-acting degludec) and prandial (regular, lispro, aspart, glulisine) insulin for an MDI regimen depends upon patient preference, lifestyle, and cost concerns. Owing to the convenience for patients regarding timing of prandial rapid-acting insulin, most patients prefer rapid-acting to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Insulin preparations'</a>.)</p><p>In short-term trials, there may be a modest glycemic benefit of analogs over conventional insulin. However, it is of uncertain clinical significance, and long-term trials with diabetic complications as endpoints are lacking. As an example, in an 18-week trial in 595 adults with type 1 diabetes randomly assigned to <span class=\"nowrap\">NPH/regular</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">detemir/aspart,</span> there was a small but significant difference in A1C values (mean difference -0.22 percentage points) favoring the insulin analogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, it should be noted that the patients in the analog group received a higher daily dose (by 4 units) of basal insulin. The risk of overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia was lower in the analog group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2610733\"><span class=\"h4\">Basal insulin options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of basal insulin depends upon patient preference, lifestyle, and cost concerns. In meta-analyses of short-term trials comparing long- (glargine or detemir) with intermediate-acting (NPH) insulin in adults with type 1 diabetes, there was little glycemic advantage to the long-acting insulin analogs (mean difference in A1C -0.06 to -0.39 percentage points) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. In one analysis, detemir once or twice daily and glargine once daily caused less weight gain than NPH once daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, there was a slightly lower risk of severe hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia with detemir once or twice daily compared with NPH once or twice daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Of note, the majority of the studies in the most recent meta-analysis used NPH once daily as the comparator, which is not standard therapy for NPH considering its duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In a randomized, clinical trial of 56 patients with type 1 diabetes using variable-dose lispro or regular insulin before meals along with twice-daily NPH insulin, A1C values were lower after 12 months (6.3 versus 6.7 percent) and hypoglycemia was less frequent (7.4 versus 11.5 episodes per month, defined as blood glucose concentrations less than 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-lispro-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin lispro</a> group, but 30 percent more NPH insulin was required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With pump therapy, basal insulin is supplied in the form of a continuous infusion (comprising between 40 and 60 percent of the TDD) with premeal bolus doses given to minimize postprandial glucose excursions. A variety of insulin pumps are available, and the choice among pumps is largely a matter of patient preference and lifestyle.

In a meta-analysis of trials comparing rapid-acting insulin analogs with regular insulin for use in CSII, there was a small but significant reduction in A1C with use of insulin analogs (mean difference -0.26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Getting started</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Initial total daily dose</strong> &ndash; When converting a patient from an MDI regimen to continuous insulin therapy, the pre-pump level of chronic glycemia will help determine the pump basal rate and preprandial scales chosen. As an example, for a patient who has been well controlled on his previous MDI regimen (eg, A1C &lt;7 percent), the initial TDD of insulin administered by pump may be 10 to 20 percent less than the TDD of the previous regimen. Conversely, patients with inadequate glycemic control may be started with the same TDD as they had been using with their injection regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Basal rate</strong> &ndash; In general, approximately one-half of the TDD is administered as basal rate. For most patients, basal rates are in the range of 0.01 to 0.015 units per kg per hour (ie, for a 60-kg woman approximately 0.6 to 0.9 units per hour). The basal rates are adjusted empirically based on glucose monitoring results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Certain time periods during the day may require higher, while other periods may require lower infusion rates depending on individual factors including lifestyle and the &quot;dawn phenomenon,&quot; which often occurs between 2 and 8 AM. Most pumps allow for preprogrammed changes in basal rate to accommodate these requirements. The &quot;dawn phenomenon&quot; is thought to result from increased secretion of hormones, particularly growth hormone, that tend to antagonize the actions of insulin and so raise blood glucose concentrations. The overnight rate can be adjusted to maintain the pre-breakfast blood glucose in the target range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When changing the subcutaneous basal insulin infusion rate, a delay in the actual increase or decrease in plasma insulin levels must be taken into account, based on the kinetics of absorption and time to reach a new steady state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

CSII is increasingly used in the pediatric population. A randomized trial in 32 children and adolescents (aged 8 to 21 years) with type 1 diabetes showed that lower A1C and premeal glucose levels were more achievable with CSII than with an insulin regimen using once-daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> and premeal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-aspart-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin aspart</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In some children with type 1 diabetes who have frequent and severe nocturnal hypoglycemia, use of an insulin pump at nighttime only (with pre-breakfast NPH insulin and three premeal doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-lispro-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin lispro</a> during the day) can improve overall glycemic control and reduce hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

If someone has taken NPH insulin before breakfast, its action is likely to be maximal around lunchtime or early afternoon. Thus, delaying lunch can lead to hypoglycemia. With continuous therapy, the steady basal infusion should maintain normoglycemia but not induce hypoglycemia. This relative advantage may also pertain to MDI regimens that use analogs instead of NPH.</p><p>In addition, insulin absorption with pump therapy is less variable from day to day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], and therefore, blood glucose profiles may be more predictable. Both the small subcutaneous depot and the constancy of the injection site and depth for the two to three days with each catheter contribute to the relative consistency of absorption. Furthermore, dosing of small doses of insulin can be achieved with CSII not possible with syringes or pens. Doses as low as 0.05 units can be accurately delivered with CSII. While these extremely small doses of insulin may not be clinically important for most, nonpump insulin delivery can only provide insulin at 1.0 unit increments, which for some patients is too much, especially when considering basal insulin dosing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19362671\"><span class=\"h4\">Sensor-augmented insulin pump</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CSII has also been used in conjunction with a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device to give the patient more information about their blood glucose levels and allow them to make better informed decisions about insulin dosing. This approach is known as sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy. A randomized trial compared sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with MDI using standard home blood glucose monitoring (and no CGM) in 329 adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Since the subcutaneous depot is very small, any interruption in continuous flow leads very quickly to hypoinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and, possibly, diabetic ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis occurs more rapidly (four versus six hours) in patients with pump malfunction who are using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-lispro-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin lispro</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient concerns</strong> &ndash; Many patients prefer not to have to wear a device and be &quot;tethered&quot; to the pump at all times.

For very intensive exercise, doses may need to be reduced further, and increased carbohydrate snacking is usually required to prevent hypoglycemia.

For some individuals, many day-to-day problems can be solved over the telephone or via e-mail (especially if blood glucoses have been faxed in or e-mailed prior to the conversation). Blood glucose levels should be reviewed at each visit. There should be agreement on a target A1C level, which should be checked at least every three months. The insulin regimen is adjusted based upon glucose patterns. Maintaining improved glycemic control over the long term requires a major effort to prevent complacency and to avoid burnout.

In comparison, the thigh or buttock is a good site for the evening intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) dose; the slower rate of absorption enhances the likelihood that the insulin will last through the night. The site of injection is less important for rapid- or long-acting insulin analogs, and therefore, they may be administered in the abdomen, thighs, buttock, or upper arms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are a number of other issues that should be reviewed in patients receiving multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). It is often helpful to focus on one particular aspect (such as exercise, diet, or carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios) for a few weeks and then switch to another issue. Giving the patient written feedback on how they are doing (graphing out their changes in weight, A1C, etc) may also be useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1969541\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucose patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before instituting any changes in therapy, it is useful to review the patient's blood glucose monitoring technique. The patient should then keep detailed food records and measure blood glucose four to seven times daily for several weeks. The results obtained should be reviewed so that the patient can learn how to interpret the findings and how to make appropriate adjustments in dietary intake and insulin dose. (See <a href=\"#H17221653\" class=\"local\">'Self-monitoring of blood glucose'</a> above.)</p><p>A number of different patterns and problems can be identified during this initial period. If the blood glucose records show no consistent pattern, the problem is usually an erratic lifestyle and eating pattern. It is important that the patient be disciplined and consistent in the content and timing of meals, the site of insulin injections, and the timing and frequency of exercise. This makes it much easier to interpret blood glucose patterns and make appropriate alterations to the regimen. Compared with previous nonphysiologic, fixed-dose regimens, current regimens provide somewhat more flexibility in timing of meals, meal size, and composition since timing and size of doses can be varied. However, it is difficult to achieve A1C goals without some degree of consistency in eating patterns. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Carbohydrate consistency'</a>.)</p><p>Inconsistency in the timing or carbohydrate content of meals can be approached by either asking the patient to maintain a more consistent carbohydrate profile from day to day (eating the same amount of carbohydrate at the same times of each day) or by helping the patient to estimate how much carbohydrate they are about to eat and adjust their premeal dose of short- (regular) or rapid-acting insulin accordingly.

In a randomized, controlled trial of 22 patients with type 1 diabetes, splitting the evening insulin regimen into short-acting insulin at dinner and NPH insulin at bedtime reduced the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Switching to a long-acting insulin analog with a flatter profile of insulin delivery (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> or degludec) may also reduce the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H2610733\" class=\"local\">'Basal insulin options'</a> above.)</p><p>In contrast, when compared with MDI, the use of CSII has not been found to consistently reduce hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, CSII in conjunction with a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, particularly one that is programmed to interrupt insulin delivery at a preset sensor glucose value (threshold-suspend feature), has been shown to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"#H19362671\" class=\"local\">'Sensor-augmented insulin pump'</a> above.)</p><p>The fear of hypoglycemia is often not expressed openly by patients but can be a substantial barrier to achieving strict glycemic control with insulin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. It is therefore important to address this issue directly with any patient beginning insulin therapy. Educational strategies need to focus on how to help the patient live safely with the increased risk. The management of hypoglycemia is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypoglycemia during treatment of diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interactive-diabetes-case-3-hypoglycemia-in-a-patient-with-type-1-diabetes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interactive diabetes case 3: Hypoglycemia in a patient with type 1 diabetes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight gain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight gain is a common problem with modern-day insulin regimens. Patients randomly assigned to intensive insulin therapy in the DCCT gained significantly more weight than those who received conventional therapy (5.1 versus 2.4 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Higher baseline A1C values and greater decrements in A1C during intensive therapy were both associated with greater weight gain.</p><p>The potential importance of these findings is illustrated in a subsequent analysis, in which patients were divided into quartiles based upon weight gain, from no weight gain (first quartile) to maximal weight gain (fourth quartile) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. The mean body mass index (BMI) in the fourth quartile was 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> placing these patients in the obesity range. The following results were observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive insulin therapy resulted in similar glycemic control at follow-up (mean 6.1 years) in all the weight-gain quartiles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in the first quartile (no weight gain) had decreases in serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations compared with baseline, reflecting the benefits of improved glycemic control on serum lipid concentrations in the absence of weight gain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in the fourth quartile had a significant elevation in serum concentrations of these lipids and in blood pressure compared with baseline. They also had higher waist-to-hip ratios (abdominal obesity) than patients in other quartiles.</p><p/><p>The constellation of lipid abnormalities, abdominal obesity, and hypertension is similar to that in the central obesity-insulin resistance syndrome that is characteristic of many patients with type 2 diabetes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X)&quot;</a>). Such patients are predisposed to develop coronary atherosclerosis, although it is unproven whether control of weight gain could be important in decreasing the risk of macrovascular complications in patients receiving intensive insulin therapy. Excessive weight gain might detract from the demonstrated benefit of insulin therapy on macrovascular complications demonstrated by the <span class=\"nowrap\">DCCT/Epidemiology</span> of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Noncompliance may also be a problem in patients concerned about weight gain. As an example, in two studies of women with type 1 diabetes, 31 percent intentionally omitted insulin injections on occasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>] and 8.8 percent did so on a regular basis in order to avoid weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1969803\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes-related complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with diabetes require ongoing evaluation for diabetes-related complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63002 \">table 3</a>).

Intensive diabetes therapy includes the coordination of <span class=\"nowrap\">meals/diet</span> and activity with physiologic insulin replacement, which involves the frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels, with the goal of achieving glycemic control as close to the nondiabetic range as safely possible. (See <a href=\"#H17221321\" class=\"local\">'Intensive diabetes therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) goals in patients with diabetes should be tailored to the individual, balancing the demonstrated benefits with regard to prevention and delay in microvascular complications with the risk of hypoglycemia. For adults with type 1 diabetes, we aim for an A1C value of 7 percent (using an assay aligned to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [DCCT] in which the upper limit of normal is 6 percent) or lower in patients in whom the benefits outweigh the risks. (See <a href=\"#H17221387\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic targets'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with type 1 diabetes, the goal of insulin therapy is to provide a physiologic profile of insulin by administration of a basal level of insulin (delivered by daily or twice-daily injections of an intermediate- or long-acting insulin preparation, or continuous subcutaneous delivery of a rapid insulin preparation via a pump) and premeal boluses of a short- (regular) or rapid-acting insulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73676 \">table 1</a>). The dose of the premeal bolus is determined by the ambient blood glucose level before the meal, the size and composition of the meal, and anticipated activity levels. (See <a href=\"#H17221493\" class=\"local\">'Insulin replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood glucose monitoring, using a glucose meter to read the test strips, should be done four to seven times daily (ideally before meals, mid-morning, mid-afternoon, before bedtime, and occasionally at 3 AM). With continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), blood glucose levels are reported in real time. CGM does not eliminate the need for capillary blood sampling for calibration and to confirm hypoglycemic levels. A1C should be tested regularly to determine chronic glucose control. (See <a href=\"#H17221653\" class=\"local\">'Self-monitoring of blood glucose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with type 1 diabetes should receive ongoing self-management education and support in order to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life. Diabetes therapy will be successful only if the patient is fully committed to it, has good understanding of the regimen, and is supported by a health care team with sufficient enthusiasm and expertise to educate the patient and to continuously monitor his or her progress. (See <a href=\"#H16545191\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes education'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice between multiple daily injections (MDI) and continuous subcutaneous delivery of a rapid insulin preparation via a pump is largely a matter of patient preference and lifestyle. It should be made only after both regimens are carefully explained to the patient. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Choice of insulin delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several different MDI regimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69575\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69575 \">table 2</a>). The choice of basal and premeal bolus insulin for an MDI regimen depends upon patient preference, lifestyle, and cost concerns. Although in short-term trials, there was a modest glycemic benefit (modest reduction in A1C <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rate of severe hypoglycemia) of insulin analogs over conventional insulin, long-term trials with diabetic complications as endpoints are lacking. In addition, the modest benefit is offset by higher cost. (See <a href=\"#H17221891\" class=\"local\">'Choosing basal/prandial insulin'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Human versus analogs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII; insulin pump) uses only short- (regular) or rapid-acting insulins and may provide a slight improvement in glycemic control, on average, compared with MDI regimens. Rapid-acting insulins are preferable to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>. Ketoacidosis may occur if the pump malfunctions, and it is costly and cumbersome for some patients. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoglycemia management, sick-day rules, nutrition with carbohydrate counting, exercise guidelines, pump management, and insulin injection techniques should be taught by an experienced diabetes educator and reviewed regularly. Patients should usually be seen every three months, with as-needed telephone or e-mail consultations for insulin regimen adjustments. Written feedback can help keep patients motivated to comply with their regimen.
