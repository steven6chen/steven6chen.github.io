The latter is particularly concerning since large polyps have an increased risk of harboring invasive carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Endoscopic resection of large polyps, especially laterally spreading sessile polyps, is also more time-consuming and requires more resources compared with polypectomy of smaller lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Because of these issues, surgical resection is often used, particularly for large sessile polyps and for those in locations that are difficult to treat endoscopically. However, endoscopic removal of the polyps may be possible if an endoscopist experienced in the removal of large colon polyps is available, thus avoiding the need for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/1-5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5,7</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the endoscopic removal of large colon polyps. The definition of &quot;large&quot; varies in the literature; for the purpose of this discussion, the definition of large will refer to polyps that are &ge;2.0 cm in their greatest dimension. An overview of colonoscopy and the treatment and prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding are discussed separately.

In addition, endoscopic resection may be appropriate for patients who do not meet these criteria but who are poor surgical candidates. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Features suggesting invasive cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large polyps may contain cancer that is completely contained within the polyp. In these cases, polypectomy is considered curative, provided the cancer is completely contained within the resected tissue, there is no lymphovascular invasion, and the resection margins are free of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Pedunculated polyps (ie, polyps with a stalk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59681\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59681 \">picture 1</a>)) can generally be removed endoscopically, even if the polyp tissue appears malignant, provided the stalk appears normal. Sessile polyps (ie, polyps that lack a stalk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87246\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87246 \">picture 2</a>)) should only be removed endoscopically if they lack malignant features.</p><p>For sessile polyps, features that suggest the presence of malignancy include friability, induration, and ulceration. On probing, a firm consistency or adherence of the polyp to the underlying tissue is also suggestive of malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68868\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68868 \">table 2</a>). Reports suggest that 83 to 96 percent of polyps that lack these features will be nonmalignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/1-5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5,7</a>]. In one report, endoscopic findings led to the misclassification of only 9 percent of approximately 1400 polyps, compared with a much higher misclassification rate (39 percent) with random biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Among sessile polyps, higher malignancy rates have been described for those showing a smooth, velvety surface (non-granular type, laterally spreading tumor [NG-LST]) compared with those with nodules on the surface (granular type, laterally spreading tumor [G-LST]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The former are typically located in the right colon and due to flat morphology can be difficult to detect. Mild central depressions within such a lesion may indicate the presence of invasive carcinoma. Kudo pit pattern V (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69425\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69425 \">figure 2</a>) or Paris classification IIa+c (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50239 \">table 1</a>) are also risk factors for malignant submucosal invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>A positive non-lifting sign (ie, failure of the mucosa to elevate following submucosal injection) may indicate an early colorectal cancer that has invaded the submucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. However, false positives can occur after prior biopsy or attempts at polyp removal, and one study found that patients with a history of biopsy exhibited the non-lifting sign more frequently than did those without a history (30.4 percent versus 3.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Endoscopic assessment with electronic or topical chromoendoscopy, preferably using magnification endoscopy, has been shown to be superior to the non-lifting sign for predicting submucosal invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can be used to assess for features suggesting malignancy (such as submucosal invasion or enlarged lymph nodes), particularly for sessile lesions in the rectum. Some authors use high-frequency miniprobes that can be inserted through the biopsy channel of the colonoscope and thus can be used in the entire colon, unlike dedicated EUS scopes that can only examine the distal colon. EUS is most often employed when submucosal invasion is suspected. EUS is not generally regarded as a prerequisite prior to polypectomy of large colon polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/1,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyp size and location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having an unusually large polyp (even those more than 10 cm or with circumferential growth) is not a contraindication to endoscopic resection, provided that an advanced endoscopist is available to perform the procedure. However, subsequent surveillance is mandatory to evaluate for residual or recurrent adenoma. Stricture formation after resection of circumferential lesions is common and may require endoscopic dilation. These considerations should be explained to the patient prior to embarking on endoscopic resection.</p><p>Polyps that occupy more than one-third the circumference of the colon wall, cross two haustral folds, or involve the base of the appendix, should be referred to an advanced endoscopist with expertise endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Surgery may be a better initial option for patients with multiple large polyps in the right colon since these polyps often require several endoscopic sessions for removal and are associated with increased procedural risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Endoscopic polypectomy should not be performed if circumstances do not permit repeated treatment and follow-up sessions. Furthermore, it should not be attempted in patients with uncorrectable bleeding disorders.

Only complete excision of the polyp permits accurate histologic diagnosis. </p><p>There are a number of techniques for endoscopic excision of large colon polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The approach chosen will depend on the characteristics and location of the polyp and the endoscopist's preference:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Snare polypectomy &ndash; Large pedunculated polyps can be removed by transecting the stalk of the polyp with an electrocautery snare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) &ndash; Large sessile polyps (laterally spreading tumors) are removed using EMR. The conventional injection approach applies a lift-and-cut technique in which a solution is injected into the submucosa to separate the tumor-bearing mucosa from the muscularis propria. Submucosal injection is then followed by removal of the polyp using a snare with electrocautery. Piecemeal resection is usually required for polyps larger than 2 cm in diameter. Histologic confirmation of curative resection will be more difficult after piecemeal resection since the tissue margins may not be clear. This is particularly important if a polyp is found to contain an early carcinoma since curative resection cannot be guaranteed and additional treatment including surgery may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors#H62375199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic mucosal resection techniques'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) &ndash; An alternative to EMR is ESD. ESD is a variant of EMR in which a specialized dissecting knife is used to dissect lesions from the submucosa. The advantage of ESD is that it usually permits removal of large sessile polyps en bloc (eg, in one piece), whereas EMR often removes the polyp piecemeal. However, the technique requires specialized training. ESD is typically not required for colon polyps because the majority of colon polyps are benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic submucosal dissection'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The following should be kept in mind when performing endoscopic polypectomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensnaring of a colonic fold must be carefully avoided. Large pedunculated or sessile lesions can initially obscure the anatomy. Thus, resection should only be carried out if the ensnared portion can be clearly visualized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed perforation may occur due to the spread of thermal injury to the deeper layers of the bowel wall. This can occur if a pedunculated polyp is resected too near to the bowel wall, leaving no residual stalk. This can also happen if an ensnared polyp is not lifted into the lumen of the bowel before current is applied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The snare has to be closed tightly before applying coagulation since thermal injury with delayed perforation may occur if the tip of the snare inadvertently touches the bowel wall behind the polyp. Sometimes this cannot be accomplished without cutting through the polyp. However, it is safer to transect a polyp mechanically (ie, without coagulation), since the major risk will be bleeding, which usually occurs immediately and can be controlled endoscopically.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59651498\"><span class=\"h2\">Snare polypectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most large pedunculated polyps can be removed by transection of the polyp's stalk with a polypectomy snare using electrocautery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53630\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53630 \">picture 3</a>). Snare polypectomy is also used to remove sessile polyps. In the case of small polyps (&lt;10 mm), transection may be accomplished without electrocautery (&quot;cold snaring&quot;). Polyps &ge;10 mm in size usually require electrocautery for en bloc resection. Piecemeal cold snare polypectomy for polyps &ge;10 mm has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], but further studies are needed to compare the clinical outcomes with hot snare polypectomy. Snares differ in size, shape (eg, oval, hexagonal, crescent) and constitution (eg, monofilament or braided) that result in different degrees of stiffness. The choice is personal preference; no advantage to any particular snare type has been shown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59652413\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic mucosal resection techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard EMR technique for colon polyps involves raising the polyp using submucosal injection followed by removal of the polyp with a snare (injection-assisted EMR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/1-3,5,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5,30</a>]. Sessile polyps larger than 2 cm should be resected in a piecemeal fashion to avoid perforation, and some experts suggest that any polyp greater than 1.5 cm be resected piecemeal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62455\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62455 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Endoscopists who are experts in EMR techniques may consider en bloc removal of larger polyps using EMR. Alternatively, ESD can be considered if en bloc resection is needed. (See <a href=\"#H59652181\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic submucosal dissection techniques'</a> below.)</p><p>Underwater endoscopic mucosal resection (UEMR) is a technique that eliminates the need for submucosal injection, because of the &quot;floating&quot; effect of water submersion on the mucosa and submucosa, resulting in separation from the muscularis propria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/9,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,31-33</a>]. In a study of 60 patients with a total of 62 large sessile polyps resected using UEMR, delayed bleeding occurred in three patients (5 percent) and no perforations occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Of 54 patients who underwent follow-up colonoscopy at a three-month interval, one patient had a 5 mm adenoma along a fold outside the resection scar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59656326\"><span class=\"h3\">Determine the polyp's margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to resecting the polyp, the margins of the lesion need to be defined. High-resolution endoscopes with high-definition monitors allow for clear visualization of the polyp margins in most cases, but sometimes it can be difficult to appreciate the extent of such lesions. Chromoendoscopy, narrow band imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87242 \">picture 5</a>), or addition of dye to the saline used to lift the polyp are all methods to help define the margins of the polyp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].

Some experts have suggested that any sessile polyp larger than 1.5 cm that is located proximal to the rectum should be removed following saline-lift [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>If submucosal injection is used, it is important to start with the proximal (upstream) side of the polyp as this can be difficult to access once the distal side of the polyp has been raised. Failure of the polyp to lift with saline injection raises concern for malignancy, provided the polyp has not undergone a prior attempt at resection (which could result in scar tissue anchoring the polyp to the submucosa). </p><p>Several studies have described outcomes using saline-lift techniques. One study suggested that the penetration depth of ulcers due to electrocautery was shallower after submucosal saline injection than without saline injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

However, it is unclear whether dilute epinephrine is superior to saline or other agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> in the prevention of postprocedural bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Submucosal injection prior to EMR can have drawbacks. The injected fluid may increase the submucosal tissue tension and make snare capture more difficult (ie, snare slips off the submucosal plane during closure). The injected fluid may dissipate along the submucosal plane, raising both the polyp and the adjacent normal mucosa. This may cause the polyp to flatten or become depressed, relative to the surrounding tissue. Injection may displace the neoplasia-bearing tissue into a less accessible location, such as behind a fold, or constrict the lumen, making access more difficult. </p><p>When injecting through an adenoma, there is the potential for needle track seeding of neoplastic cells into deeper wall layers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59653849\"><span class=\"h3\">Resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The polyp should be oriented at the six o'clock position, which corresponds to the operating channel of the endoscope. The polyp is then ensnared and cautery applied to resect the tissue. Current settings are based on personal preference, but most endoscopists use a blend of coagulation and cutting current applied in bursts. Every part ensnared should be lifted away from the wall before application of current to prevent deep cauterization, which is associated with an increased risk of perforation.</p><p>If a sessile polyp covers a fold, both sides of the fold have to be cleared separately. The proximal side may be difficult to visualize, and maneuvers such as lifting of the lesion by well-directed submucosal injection or working in a retroflexed position (where possible) may help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The use of a stiff monofilament snare can greatly facilitate resection since it allows for spreading out the fold. The tip is placed behind (proximal to) the fold and opened to gently push on the mucosa and flatten out the fold, exposing the polyp. The snare is then slowly closed and the catheter advanced simultaneously to keep the tip in position. It is important to maneuver the snare parallel to the colonic surface to avoid cutting too deeply. Suction of air while maintaining a lumen view prior to closing the snare will reduce wall tension and may enable a better capture of tissue; however, suctioning should be avoided while closing the snare to avoid accidental capture of the muscularis propria.</p><p>Resection should be performed systematically, beginning at one margin. Once the muscle layer has been exposed, further resection steps are performed from there, avoiding any residual islands of tissue between resected pieces. Following resection, the polypectomy site should have a &quot;clean&quot; surface. High definition white light endoscopy or narrow band imaging will usually identify any remnants of adenomatous tissue. Complete resection of the polyp in a single session is critical since scarring will make a second attempt at resection more difficult. (See <a href=\"#H59651937\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of residual adenoma'</a> below.)</p><p>En bloc resection is always preferred, but piecemeal resection is often necessary due to polyp size or location. Piecemeal resection is suggested for polyps larger than 2 cm in diameter to reduce the risk of perforation; however, no studies have defined a cutoff point for size where en bloc resection is unsafe. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59651937\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment of residual adenoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Residual adenoma can be resected with a snare to provide complete histologic assessment of the lesion. If snare resection fails, consideration should be given to referral to a center with expertise in EMR and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Coagulation of large areas of the adenoma should be avoided since the subsequent scarring will hamper any future attempt at snare mucosectomy. Remnants of adenomatous tissue that cannot be ensnared can be fulgurated with thermal coagulation modalities such as a hot biopsy forceps (hot avulsion technique) or APC probe (power limit 60W, argon flow 1 to 2 liters per minute) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F87246\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87246 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59652181\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic submucosal dissection techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ESD is a resection technique for early gastrointestinal tract cancers.

The aim of ESD is to achieve an en bloc resection, which provides more accurate oncologic evaluation of the deep and lateral margins for tumor involvement. En bloc resection also reduces the risk of adenoma recurrence that may result from residual islands remaining after piecemeal resection. </p><p>ESD is a complex and labor-intensive endoscopic technique with a steep learning curve, especially in the colon where maneuvering the endoscope is more difficult. As such, the indications for ESD for the removal of colon polyps are limited because most colon polyps are benign and can be removed piecemeal with high cure rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

A permanent dye such as India ink will trigger scar tissue formation, which can lead to submucosal fibrosis that makes additional resections by EMR or ESD more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. The injection should be performed at a distance of 3 cm or more away from the resection margin to ensure that the tattoo does not spread along the submucosal plane to the resection site. This is especially important if a polyp was incompletely resected and a second attempt at removal is planned. The location of the tattoos relative to the lesion should be noted in the endoscopy report to facilitate accurate identification of the polypectomy site.

After securing the loop, a snare must be placed over the top of the polyp and positioned above the loop ligature while trying to avoid partial ensnaring of the loop (which would make transection impossible). The floppy loop can become entrapped within the interstices of a large polyp and, when tightened, constrict the polyp head rather than the pedicle, making subsequent transection of the stalk difficult or even impossible. Other problems with nylon loops include severing of the stalk by over tightening, slipping of the loop, and insufficient tightening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]</p><p>For sessile polyps, adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> to the submucosal injectate solution can be performed.

However, clipping the resection site may be more beneficial for patients with large polyps. In a study of over 400 patients with a total of 524 polyps &ge;20 mm in size, clipping the resection site was associated with lower rates of PPB (2 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

This may be cumbersome if a large number of pieces are obtained during piecemeal resection. If the pieces are relatively small, they can be suctioned through the suction channel of the colonoscope and collected in a trap. Otherwise they may be removed using a retrieval net. This device can be opened and closed repeatedly until all the fragments of the polyps have been collected.

If margins cannot be clearly assessed, short-term endoscopic follow-up with biopsies may help to confirm absence or presence of tumor remnants.

Factors that have been associated with intraprocedural bleeding include polyp size (OR 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/10</span> mm), villous or tubulovillous histology (OR 1.8), and having the polypectomy performed at an institution that has performed fewer than 75 of the procedures (OR 3.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Some factors that have been associated with an increased risk of postprocedural bleeding following EMR of large colon polyps include a proximal colon location (OR 3.7), use of electrosurgical current not controlled by a microprocessor (OR 2.0), and intraprocedural bleeding at the time of polyp removal (OR 2.2).</p><p>Perforation is the most serious complication of polyp removal, but it can usually be prevented by adherence to careful technique.

In addition, endoscopic resection may be appropriate for patients who do not meet these criteria but who are poor surgical candidates. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two primary goals of colonic polypectomy. The first is to completely remove all neoplastic tissue. The second is to provide a tissue sample that can be evaluated histologically. There are a number of techniques for endoscopic excision of large colon polyps. The approach chosen will depend on the characteristics and location of the polyp and the endoscopist's preference (see <a href=\"#H2951577220\" class=\"local\">'Polyp removal techniques'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Snare polypectomy &ndash; Large pedunculated polyps can typically be removed by transecting the stalk of the polyp with electrocautery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) &ndash; Large sessile polyps are removed using EMR. The conventional technique is a lift-and-cut technique in which submucosal injection is used to separate mucosal and submucosal lesions from the muscularis propria. Submucosal injection is then followed by removal of the polyp using a snare with electrocautery. Histologic evaluation may be more difficult after piecemeal resection since the tissue margins may not be clear. This is particularly important if a polyp is found to contain an early carcinoma since the presence of cancer at a resection margin requires additional treatment (eg, surgery). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors#H62375199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic mucosal resection techniques'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) &ndash; An alternative to EMR is ESD. ESD is a variant of EMR in which a specialized needle knife is used to dissect lesions from the submucosa. The advantage of ESD is that it often permits removal of large sessile polyps en bloc (eg, in one piece), whereas EMR often removes the polyp piecemeal. However, the technique requires specialized training. ESD is typically not required for colon polyps because the majority of colon polyps are benign, so they can be removed piecemeal with a low recurrence risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-removal-of-large-colon-polyps/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endoscopic-resection-of-gastrointestinal-tumors#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic submucosal dissection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EMR and ESD are both associated with high success rates (85 to 95 percent) with acceptable adenoma recurrence rates. In most cases, recurrent adenomas can be treated with additional endoscopic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H59651526\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two major complications of endoscopic removal of large colon polyps are bleeding and perforation. Bleeding rates following EMR for colon polyps range from 2 to 11 percent. The bleeding rate after ESD is reported to be less than 2 percent. Perforation is the most serious complication of polyp removal, but it can usually be prevented by adherence to careful technique. Perforation following EMR is rare (0 to 1 percent). However, the rate may be as high as 10 percent with ESD. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up endoscopy is mandatory after endoscopic resection of large adenomas to exclude residual or recurrent adenoma. The follow-up protocol will depend on the manner of resection and histology.
