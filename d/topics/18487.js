The most common indication for these procedures is treatment of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. Rarely, chronic benign conditions such as lichen planus may be severe enough to warrant vaginectomy. Partial vaginectomy may also be utilized to biopsy large vaginal lesions of unknown etiology. Radical vaginectomy is performed for pelvic malignancy involving or encroaching upon the vagina. It is rarely indicated. More commonly, at the time of radical hysterectomy for early cervix cancer or endometrial cancer involving the cervix, the upper third (2 to 3 cm) of the vagina is removed with some adjacent paracolpium.</p><p>Vaginectomy is reviewed here. Conditions for which vaginectomy is indicated are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen planus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PARTIAL OR TOTAL VAGINECTOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure should be clearly explained to the patient and her partner, particularly with regard to complications. The issue of vaginal reconstruction should also be raised, depending upon the amount of vagina to be removed and patient wishes. Thorough bowel preparation is mandatory for more extensive vaginal surgery in case of injury to the rectum or anus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery#H8420779\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Bowel preparation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Operative procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General, epidural, or spinal anesthesia is administered. The patient may be placed in lithotomy position if the only approach is via the perineum and vaginal reconstruction is not planned. For all other procedures, the patient is placed in a modified frog leg position in Allen stirrups.</p><p>A total abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy is usually performed concurrently in women with an intact uterus who require total vaginectomy or upper partial vaginectomy. If two surgeons are available, a combined abdominoperineal approach facilitates the surgery. For women who have previously undergone hysterectomy, it is possible to perform total vaginectomy entirely from below. Great care must be taken to include all vaginal skin in the angles and vault of the vagina.</p><p>To decide whether a total or partial vaginectomy is to be performed, the vagina is initially inspected and the margins of resection identified. Placing one or more sutures to mark the extent of planned resection or staining the vagina may facilitate subsequent dissection, particularly if the procedure is being performed by the abdominal route. If a lesion is to be excised, then the placement of sutures at key points around it is particularly useful. When small lesions are excised, the mucosa of the vagina can be closed using <span class=\"nowrap\">3/0</span> polyglactin sutures.</p><p>In a combined abdomino-vaginal procedure, the vaginal part of the procedure is usually quicker than the abdominal so the vaginal operator may delay this dissection until the uterus has been mobilized. The lower incision is made with a scalpel circumferentially cutting around the vagina. Forceps are applied to the upper edge; applying gentle traction allows the operator to dissect the vaginal skin off underlying structures with scissors. Care must be taken anteriorly over the urethra because the tough underlying connective tissue makes dissection difficult. &quot;Buttonholes&quot; and tears of the vagina should be avoided. Dissection is continued as far up the vagina as can be reached easily. Bleeding from venous sinuses often requires running sutures. Bleeding may be reduced by the prophylactic injection of a vasoconstricting agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> diluted to 1 to 100,000 in saline.</p><p>The abdominal surgeon performs the first stages of a total abdominal hysterectomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal hysterectomy&quot;</a>). Broad ligaments are taken, uterine arteries are divided and ligated in the normal fashion, the uterovesical fold of peritoneum is also divided, and the bladder dissected off the vagina. The bladder dissection is aided by traction on Kelly forceps applied to the peritoneal edge over the bladder and simultaneous traction on the uterus, which stretches the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54784\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54784 \">figure 1</a>). Sharp dissection should be used to reduce bleeding and preserve tissue planes. The dissection should be continued laterally underneath the path of the distal ureters on each side. The peritoneum in the posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas) is incised close to its attachment to the cervix and vagina, and the rectum is dissected gently away. This dissection can be completed readily with the assistance of the perineal surgeon.</p><p>Straight Zeppelin forceps are placed on the paravaginal tissues along the line of the vagina medial to the uterine artery pedicles. A scalpel is used to divide the tissues on the vaginal side and the pedicle is transfixed and ligated. It is important to ensure that the ureters are not caught in the forceps or resulting pedicle. If the ureters cannot be clearly identified, they should be dissected off the parametrium after deroofing the ureteric tunnel, employing a technique similar to that used for radical hysterectomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical hysterectomy&quot;</a>). Additional pedicles are taken until the lower limit of resection is reached. At a convenient moment, the vagina is opened anteriorly from above, with the perineal surgeon guiding the point of entry.</p><p>Following removal of the specimen, hemostasis is secured using electrocauterization and suture ligatures. The procedure now depends upon the extent of the vaginectomy and the need for vaginal reconstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Previous hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient has had a previous hysterectomy, total or partial vaginectomy can be performed separately, from above or below. There are proponents of both routes, but the abdominal approach has the advantage of allowing better visualization and dissection of the ureters, and a more complete excision of the vault and the corners of the vaginal vault where intraepithelial neoplasia can be hidden. Bowel adherent to the vault can also be dissected free. A technique of vaginal resection performed from below for locally recurrent carcinoma of the cervix in patients who had previously undergone hysterectomy has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In the abdominal approach, the vault of the vagina is identified with the aid of a gauze roll on a sponge-holder placed in the vagina to stretch up the vault. The peritoneum over the vault is incised and the bladder is dissected off the vagina with dissecting scissors. The posterior cul-de-sac peritoneum is incised and the rectum is separated from the vagina and uterosacral ligaments. The course of the ureters may have been distorted as a result of previous surgery. Therefore, care must be taken to identify them, and they may require dissecting out to clear the area of the upper vagina, as with a radical hysterectomy. Once the bladder, ureters, and rectum are clear, the dissection continues as described above. When partial vaginectomy is performed from above, use of a laparoscopic approach may be feasible and has the advantage of avoiding a larger incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If no vaginal reconstruction is to be performed, the vaginal defect can be allowed to close off. A suction drain may be brought out through the abdomen or perineum. If there is persistent oozing, a povidone-iodine-soaked pack can be inserted for 24 to 48 hours with its tail brought out through the perineum.</p><p>If an upper vaginectomy has been undertaken and vaginal reconstruction is not planned, the edges of the residual vagina may be run from above with continuous 0 polyglactin suture for hemostasis and left open, or closed with interrupted sutures. If there is only residual vaginal skin at the lower end, no special closure is necessary, although it is sometimes possible to mobilize the residual skin and sew the anterior and posterior edges together to prevent sequestration of vaginal epithelium in which intraepithelial neoplasia may develop.</p><p>Following the extensive dissection, competence of the bladder can be tested by distending it with saline with or without dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RADICAL VAGINECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal difference between radical and non-radical vaginectomy is the extent of resection of tissues lateral to the upper half of the vagina. Total radical vaginectomy is frequently performed together with removal of either the bladder or rectum, or both as part of a total pelvic exenteration for pelvic malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In gynecologic oncology, radical vaginectomy is most commonly performed to treat carcinoma of the cervix that has recurred in the cervix and upper vagina following first-line therapy with chemoradiation. Partial radical upper vaginectomy may be performed routinely as part of a radical hysterectomy for early carcinoma of the cervix. Also, if an occult early cervical cancer is discovered incidentally following a simple hysterectomy, partial radical upper vaginectomy may be performed with radical parametrectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Operative procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When performed concurrently with radical hysterectomy or parametrectomy, but not as part of an exenteration procedure, the distal ureters and bladder are dissected from the upper vagina, paracolpium, and parametrium. The rectum is separated from the vagina and uterosacral ligaments, and the uterosacral ligaments are divided as part of the radical hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical hysterectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A nerve-sparing technique to preserve the autonomic nerves to the bladder should be used whenever possible at the time of upper vaginectomy performed with radical hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The parametrial tissues are clamped and ligated. Following this, the bladder and ureters are gently elevated by retractors and, while the uterus and vagina are stretched cephalad, the surgeon dissects the bladder distally off the vagina. The excisional part of the procedure is completed when the vagina is transected at the required level. If the whole vagina is to be removed, it is best for two surgeons to work together. As the abdominal surgeon dissects the ureters, bladder, and rectum away from the vagina, parametrium, and paracolpium, the perineal surgeon pushes the vagina medially and guides placement of the Zeppelin forceps onto these tissues by the abdominal surgeon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82261\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82261 \">figure 2</a>). The upper lateral tissues of the paracolpium are clamped, divided, and ligated until the vagina is freed on both sides. Hemostasis is then secured and vaginal reconstruction is performed, if planned.</p><p>A laparoscopic approach can be used for radical vaginectomy performed both at the time of radical hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and at the time of total pelvic exenteration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A laparoscopic approach to total vaginectomy for patients with primary vaginal carcinoma has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although it is usually necessary to remove the upper 2 to 3 cm of the vagina at the time of radical hysterectomy for cervix cancer, preservation of bladder function can be facilitated by avoidance of injury to the autonomic nerves running in the dorsal and posterior part of the parametrium. Care should be taken to restrict resection to only the medial paracolpium tissues in the upper third of the vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the bladder has been left in situ, a 16 French Foley catheter is inserted suprapubically at the time of surgery. This allows bladder function to be assessed postoperatively before catheter removal. If a perineal pack has been placed, it is removed after 24 to 48 hours. The patient is encouraged to resume a normal diet postoperatively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major postoperative complications are urinary and rectal fistula and chronic bladder and rectal dysfunction. These problems are more common after radical vaginectomy than total or partial procedures. Bladder dysfunction is markedly reduced using a nerve-sparing technique when upper vaginectomy is performed at the time of radical hysterectomy. Radical vaginal surgery may also alter body image perception and cause severe psychosexual problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">VAGINAL RECONSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of vaginal reconstruction are to promote rapid wound healing, decrease pelvic dead space, restore the pelvic floor, and reestablish good sexual function and body image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Vaginal reconstruction may be indicated in women who have vaginal defects from treatment of benign disease, gynecological cancer, or non-gynecological cancer invading or in close proximity to the vagina.</p><p>Vaginal reconstruction is best performed at primary surgery because the cavity is &quot;ready&quot; and does not require further dissection. Delayed procedures are more difficult because of scarring and soft tissue contracture. In older women with severe utero-vaginal prolapse, the vagina may be resected and the cavity obliterated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>If only vaginectomy has been performed, without removal of the bladder or rectum, a number of techniques are available. A split-thickness skin graft may be applied to the residual tissues, if sufficient, or to an omental tube. A full-thickness skin graft, a transposition skin flap (eg, pudendal thigh flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]), or a sigmoid colon or cecal neovagina are alternatives. Myocutaneous flaps are too bulky after non-radical surgery (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies of the vagina&quot;, section on 'Vaginal agenesis'</a>). The use of an acellular dermal graft has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Following vaginectomy in combination with exenteration, reconstruction of a neovagina with skin flaps is inadequate due to poor vascularity, dead space, and lack of pelvic support. Myocutaneous flaps bring bulky vascularized tissue into the pelvis, which reduces the chance of the empty pelvis syndrome developing. Possibilities include gracilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and rectus abdominis flaps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], with the latter being more reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Early complications include infection, delayed wound healing, loss of the flap due to necrosis, fistula formation, and small bowel herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. After the reconstructed vagina has healed, sexual function may be painful or otherwise unsatisfactory due a vagina that is too short, too narrow or wide, too dry or wet, or insensitive. Pre- and postoperative psychosexual counseling may help patients with these issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial and total vaginectomy refer to procedures in which the vaginal epithelium is removed without disruption of tissues of the paracolpium.
