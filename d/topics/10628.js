The family name is derived from the Latin &quot;filum,&quot; meaning &quot;thread-like,&quot; based upon the filamentous structure of the virion. The filoviruses resemble rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses in their genome organization and intracellular replication mechanism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies#H2006908\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rabies&quot;, section on 'Virology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-epidemiology-and-transmission\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles: Epidemiology and transmission&quot;</a>.). </p><p>The genus <em>Marburgvirus</em> contains a single species that consists of two recognized variants, <em>Lake Victoria marburgvirus</em> and <em>Ravn marburgvirus</em>, which show approximately 20 percent overall sequence divergence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Despite this variation, the two strains cause an apparently identical disease in humans and laboratory animals, and animals that have received an experimental vaccine based on one variant are cross-protected against the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In contrast, Ebola vaccines do not provide protection against Marburg virus. (See <a href=\"#H464353528\" class=\"local\">'Vaccine development'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464354381\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709225079\"><span class=\"h2\">Endemic areas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first recognized outbreak of Marburg virus disease occurred in Germany and Yugoslavia in 1967; the overall fatality rate was 23 percent. This outbreak was a result of the inadvertent importation of infected vervet monkeys (<em>Chlorocebus pygerythrus</em>) from Uganda for use in vaccine production. Following the outbreak, a wide variety of animal species were trapped and sampled for virus in the region where the macaques had been captured, but a source of the infection was not identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>Since then, all human infections with Marburg virus have occurred in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Fatality rates among patients have been as high as 80 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. No cases of Marburg virus disease have been identified in the region of West Africa where the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic took place. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease#H357230390\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on '2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa'</a>.) </p><p>Reports of Marburg virus disease include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1975, a young man who had been hitchhiking in Rhodesia became ill after arriving in South Africa; the infection spread to a travelling companion and to a nurse who cared for them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The source was not identified. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The next recognized outbreak did not take place until 1998, when cases of severe febrile illness were recognized among men working in an abandoned mine in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where they were heavily exposed to bats and their excretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The association with bats led to studies that recovered infectious virus from bats in the cave. (See <a href=\"#H464350014\" class=\"local\">'Viral reservoirs'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest epidemic of Marburg virus disease, with almost 400 cases, occurred in Angola in 2004 and was centered on a pediatric ward where infection was apparently spread through the use of contaminated transfusion equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The original source of infection was not identified. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since 2004, Marburg virus disease has been identified only in Uganda. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Two cases occurred in tourists who entered bat-infested caves. One was a Dutch woman who was &quot;bumped&quot; by a bat during a visit to the cave in 2009; upon returning home, she developed a rapidly progressive illness, leading to her death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. News of the case resulted in the retrospective identification of a nonfatal infection in a woman from Colorado who visited the same cave in 2008 and subsequently developed a febrile illness with hepatitis, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy, from which she recovered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Screening of her serum revealed antibodies to Marburg virus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In an epidemic that occurred in 2012, cases of Marburg virus disease were identified in four different locations in Uganda, but the outbreak was contained within two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All chains of transmission were found to originate from a single source, with amplification through attendance at a traditional funeral; no history of exposure to bats or other potential reservoir species was obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464350014\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral reservoirs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The search for reservoir species has focused on bats, which have been present in large numbers at sites of human infection in the DRC and Uganda. (See <a href=\"#H709225079\" class=\"local\">'Endemic areas'</a> above.)</p><p>In 2009, scientists at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the isolation of Marburg virus from Egyptian fruit bats (<em>Rousettus aegyptiacus</em>) captured in a mine in Uganda where numerous infections had occurred in workers over a 10-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The isolates showed considerable genomic variation, suggesting that Marburg virus has been present in the bat population for a long time, permitting significant diversification to take place. Studies in captive <em>R. aegyptiacus</em> have found that chronically infected animals shed virus in oral and vaginal fluids without becoming ill, and that increased shedding occurs when female bats give birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. The wide geographic dispersion of outbreaks of Marburg virus disease suggests the virus is present among chronically infected bats across all of central Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/16,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464353560\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marburg virus disease spreads from person to person through direct contact with the blood or other body fluids of a patient or during preparation of a body for burial. As an example, treatment of the 25 patients during the outbreak in Germany and Yugoslavia resulted in six secondary infections among doctors and nurses. In addition, one man who survived infection transmitted the virus to his wife, apparently through sexual intercourse. Persistence of infectious virus in semen was also observed during the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease#H107362808\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Convalescence'</a>.)</p><p>Infection during patient care or washing of a cadaver may result from the inadvertent transfer of virus on contaminated hands to the mouth or eyes. When appropriate precautions have been used, secondary spread has been limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. In contrast, hospitals that do not employ adequate infection control measures may enhance the spread of virus. As an example, Marburg virus appears to have been transmitted through the use of improperly sterilized injection equipment during the 2004 outbreak in Angola [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Infection prevention and control precautions used to care for patients with Marburg virus should be the same as those employed to care for those with Ebola virus disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease#H1056044081\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Infection control precautions during acute illness'</a>.) </p><p>There are no data to suggest that Marburg virus is transmitted among humans by mosquitoes or other biting arthropods. In addition, although laboratory animals have been infected by virus placed on the oral or conjunctival mucosa and by exposure to aerosolized virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], there is no evidence that patients with Marburg virus disease have transmitted the infection to others by the respiratory route. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464351738\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data from human patients and more extensive experimental studies in laboratory animals indicate that the pathogenesis of Marburg virus disease closely resembles that of Ebola virus disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After the virus enters the body via mucous membrane or skin penetration, macrophages and dendritic cells are the first cells to be infected. Filoviruses replicate readily within these ubiquitous &quot;sentinel&quot; cells, causing their necrosis and releasing large numbers of new viral particles into extracellular fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57590\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57590 \">figure 1</a>). The spread of virus via lymphatic channels to regional lymph nodes results in further rounds of replication, followed by bloodstream dissemination to dendritic cells and to fixed and mobile macrophages in the liver, spleen, and other lymphoid tissues. Two virus-encoded proteins, VP24 and VP35, facilitate rapid systemic dissemination by blocking the production of type I interferon by infected cells and inhibiting the response to exogenous interferon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Further spread of virus to hepatocytes, adrenal cortical, and other parenchymal cells results in extensive tissue necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464351821\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic inflammatory response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in Ebola virus disease, systemic inflammation plays a critical role in the etiology of vascular dysfunction, shock, and death from Marburg virus disease. Infected macrophages and other target cells produce large quantities of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, while the release of nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and other vasoactive substances produces a general increase in vascular permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/29,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33</a>]. In addition to the effects of circulating proinflammatory mediators, the production of tissue factor on the surface of virus-infected cells triggers coagulation cascades, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464351995\"><span class=\"h2\">Impairment of adaptive immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients dying of filovirus disease typically fail to show an antibody response to the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; this impairment reflects both direct and indirect attacks on immune function. Dendritic cells, which have primary responsibility for the initiation of adaptive immune responses, fail to be activated by filoviral infection and are destroyed through necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Adaptive immunity is also impaired by a massive loss of lymphocytes. These cells are not infected by filoviruses, but undergo &quot;bystander&quot; apoptosis, presumably induced by inflammatory mediators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the loss of support signals from dendritic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464352219\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marburg virus is one of the most virulent human pathogens, causing a rapidly progressive febrile illness that leads to shock and death in a large proportion of infected individuals. Because bleeding is observed in some patients, the disease has traditionally been labeled &quot;Marburg hemorrhagic fever&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/6,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,39</a>]. However, few patients actually develop significant hemorrhage, and it is rarely the cause of death. Thus, just as the term &quot;Ebola hemorrhagic fever&quot; has been replaced by &quot;Ebola virus disease,&quot; the syndrome caused by Marburg virus should now be designated &quot;Marburg virus disease.&quot; </p><p>The clinical manifestations of Marburg virus disease are similar to those produced by Ebola virus, as described in reports from the 2014-2016 epidemic in West Africa (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease#H134221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>). These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following an incubation period averaging about one week, Marburg virus disease typically begins with the abrupt onset of fever, chills, and general malaise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/6,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,39</a>]. Other signs and symptoms may include weakness, anorexia, severe headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain in the muscles of the trunk and lower back. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding is rare in the early phase of illness, but may become manifest later in the form of petechial hemorrhages of mucous membranes, ecchymoses, and continued oozing from venipuncture sites. Severe bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or other sites is commonly observed only during the terminal phase of fatal infections. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional clinical findings may include a diffuse maculopapular rash, hiccups, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, confusion, seizures, obtundation, and coma. </p><p/><p>Abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests also resemble those seen in Ebola virus disease, and include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevations in serum transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) levels, increases in serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, and abnormal coagulation indices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/6,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,39</a>]. As an example, in the 1967 Marburg outbreak, many patients had striking leukopenia with total white blood cell counts as low as <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL,</span> and immature forms at the time of clinical presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Serum aminotransferase levels rose rapidly on days 6 to 8 of illness, and became highest in patients who died from infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease#H134730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Laboratory findings'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464349656\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to Ebola virus disease, the diagnosis of Marburg virus disease is based upon the detection of specific RNA sequences by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or viral antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, in contrast to Ebola virus disease, for which rapid diagnostic tests underwent field testing during the West African epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], tests for Marburg virus are still confined to the research laboratory. A discussion of the tests used to diagnose Ebola virus disease is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464349663\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no approved specific therapies for Marburg virus disease. As for Ebola virus disease, patient management relies on aggressive supportive care to prevent the development of shock while the patient's immune system mobilizes the responses needed to eliminate the virus. Infection prevention and control precautions used to care for patients with Marburg virus should be the same as those employed to care for patients with Ebola virus disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease#H344737195\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Supportive care'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease#H1056044081\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Infection control precautions during acute illness'</a>.)</p><p>Several experimental treatments have shown benefits in laboratory-infected animals.

In one study, a preparation of highly concentrated polyclonal IgG antibodies recovered from the serum of immune macaques was effective in preventing death when administered to naive macaques starting two days after an otherwise lethal Marburg virus challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and a lipid-encapsulated siRNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], both targeting messenger RNA encoding the viral nucleoprotein, also protected macaques. However, production of the latter has been discontinued by the manufacturer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One small-molecule drug under development is the nucleoside analogue BCX4430, which prevented the death of macaques when treatment began two days after the Marburg virus challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/marburg-virus/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the West African epidemic, the <span class=\"nowrap\">nucleoside/nucleotide</span> analogues favipiravir and GS-5734 were given to patients with Ebola virus disease, but to date there are no reports of the effect of either drug against Marburg virus in laboratory animals.
