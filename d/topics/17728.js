The association between these disorders is multifaceted. Anxiety-related disorders may increase the risk for the development of SUDs and may alter the presentation and treatment outcome of SUDs. SUDs may alter the presentation and outcome of treatment for anxiety-related disorders.</p><p>The complexity of these comorbidities highlights the importance of recognizing the symptoms of each disorder and diagnosing them accurately. Effective treatment requires consideration of potentially toxic drug-drug interactions, medication abuse liability, and patient adherence. Evidence from clinical trials of treatments for the disorders when presenting individually is generally inadequate to determine treatment effectiveness for anxiety disorders and SUDs when presenting concurrently.</p><p>This topic reviews treatment of co-occurring substance use disorders and anxiety-related disorders.

Treating the SUD without addressing the anxiety-related disorders may render the patient vulnerable to relapse in the face of anxiety symptoms. Treating the anxiety-related disorders without addressing and monitoring the SUD will likely result in ineffective, or even harmful, treatment. </p><p>Anxiety symptoms may undermine treatment outcome by serving as a trigger for relapse. SUD patients need to learn skills for managing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accepting anxiety or trauma-related symptoms without using substances. As an example, patients with panic disorder who complete exposure or other anxiety-provoking homework assignments while under the influence of alcohol or drugs will not experience the rise and fall of anxiety during those assignments, nor will they learn that they are able to withstand the anxiety without using alcohol or drugs. </p><p>Based on limited data from clinical trials and our clinical experience, we suggest first-line treatment of most adults with an anxiety-related disorder and a co-occurring SUD with integrative cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that addresses both disorders rather than other treatments. The evidence in support of integrated CBT for these co-occurring disorders is limited and has yielded mixed results. (See <a href=\"#H1332646\" class=\"local\">'Integrated CBT'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who prefer medication treatment rather than CBT, or if CBT is unavailable, we suggest treatment of the anxiety-related disorder with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) over other medications. In such cases, the SUD should be treated as well. The pharmacotherapy of individual anxiety disorders and treatment of individual SUDs are reviewed separately.

Selection of medications for treatment of co-occurring anxiety-related disorders and SUDs needs to take into account the abuse potential of medications prescribed as well as the potential for toxic interactions between the medications and abused substances, and between the medications and medical conditions caused by abused substances. In addition, clinicians should proactively address the increased risk of nonadherence to prescribed medications seen in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H3206898501\" class=\"local\">'Medication'</a> below.)</p><p>Medication may be needed early on particularly to help reduce anxiety or trauma-related symptoms while the patient is mastering behavioral ways of coping with the symptoms, if there are withdrawal symptoms that will lead to relapse, and to help increase retention. Pharmacotherapies that address substance use withdrawal and craving, which may mimic or exacerbate these symptoms, may be needed in addition to integrated CBT. </p><p>Accumulating research evidence has challenged past beliefs that patients with a co-occurring anxiety-related disorders and SUD had to be abstinent for an extended period (eg, three to six months) before treating anxiety. As an example, trials of treatment for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder and a SUD found that addressing the trauma early in treatment results in significant improvements in anxiety symptoms as well as alcohol and drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-co-occurring-substance-use-disorder-and-anxiety-related-disorders-in-adults/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>].
