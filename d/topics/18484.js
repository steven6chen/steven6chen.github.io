The relative rarity of VaIN, which is far less common than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), is an impediment to a thorough understanding of the disease process and its natural course. As a result, much of this information is an extrapolation of our knowledge of the pathophysiology of cervical and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.</p><p>Diagnosis and management of women with VaIN is reviewed here. VIN and CIN are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Treatment and follow-up&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VaIN is defined by the presence of squamous cell atypia without invasion. The disease is classified according to the depth of epithelial involvement: VaIN 1 and 2 involve the lower one-third and two-thirds of the epithelium, respectively, and VaIN 3 involves more than two-thirds of the epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68837\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68837 \">picture 1</a>). Carcinoma in situ, which encompasses the full thickness of the epithelium, is included under VaIN 3. In 2012, as part of the lower anogenital squamous terminology (LAST) standardization project for human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated lesions, the College of American Pathologists and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology have proposed a revised terminology by which VaIN is reported using a two-tiered nomenclature: LSIL for low-grade disease (VaIN 1) and HSIL for high-grade disease (VaIN <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Intraepithelial vaginal dysplasia of glandular origin, or atypical vaginal adenosis, is a separate entity. This lesion has a well-established association with in utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure and may be a precursor to DES-associated clear cell adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, cases have been reported of atypical adenosis and vaginal adenocarcinomas in non-DES-exposed women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of VaIN is unknown, but is estimated at 0.2 to 0.3 cases per 100,000 women in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The average patient is between 43 and 60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Based on data from the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, the incidence of vaginal carcinoma in situ in the US is estimated at 0.1 cases per 100,000 women. Vaginal carcinoma in situ incidence peaks at age 70 to 79 years, slightly younger than the peak incidence age for vaginal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although multiple risk factors have been implicated in the genesis of lower genital tract neoplasias, infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common association (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> below)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, in a case-control study of 19 patients, low level of education, low family income, and history of vaginal condyloma were all risk factors for developing VaIN, but are also dependent variables predicting exposure to HPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Genetic and acquired immunosuppression, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, are risk factors for developing both VaIN and HPV infection, as with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-and-vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV-infected women&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cancer screening tests: Techniques for cervical cytology and human papillomavirus testing&quot;, section on 'HPV testing'</a>.)</p><p>VaIN is consistently associated with prior or concurrent neoplasia elsewhere in the lower genital tract. In most studies, 50 to 90 percent of patients with VaIN had or currently have either intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma of the cervix or vulva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/6,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13-15</a>]. In addition, approximately 1 to 7 percent of patients undergoing hysterectomy for CIN develop VaIN a few months to several years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. As an example, one study found VaIN in 5 percent of 793 patients followed for 10 years after surgery for CIN 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There is evidence that some high-grade vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is a monoclonal lesion derived from high-grade or malignant cervical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Women who undergo hysterectomy for benign conditions other than CIN are at lower risk for developing VaIN than women with CIN or cancer. In one report, the average time to diagnosis of VaIN after hysterectomy in women with benign disease was 11 years, compared with one year among women with CIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another large cohort study found a mean time to diagnosis of VaIN for women who had undergone hysterectomy of 14 years if the hysterectomy was for benign indications and 10 years if the hysterectomy was for dysplasia or carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Subsequent occult vaginal invasion appears to be more common in patients with CIN treated with hysterectomy than in those whose cervix was retained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This may be the result of lower rates of follow-up cytology and more difficult examination of the vaginal apex in hysterectomized women. It may also be a result of selection bias, as only women with no cervical dysplasia are likely to have their cervix retained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cancer screening tests: Techniques for cervical cytology and human papillomavirus testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some data suggest an increased risk for VaIN <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3</span> in high risk HPV-positive women who smoke compared to high-risk HPV-positive non-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The data regarding the role of previous radiation treatment in the development of secondary neoplasia of the vagina are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two etiologies have been proposed to explain the strong association between VaIN and neoplasia elsewhere in the lower genital tract. One possibility is that women who develop VaIN shortly after surgery for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) may simply have vaginal extension of cervical disease that was not detected and treated. However, VaIN is frequently multifocal, can occur several years after a hysterectomy for neoplasia, is independent of the amount of vaginal cuff excised, and is often observed de novo in the absence of cervical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, it is unlikely that the condition is the result of extension from the cervix in every case.</p><p>A second theory is that lower genital tract neoplasias share common etiologic factors, since approximately one-half of VaIN lesions are associated with concomitant cervical or vulvar neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. This field effect is based upon the principle that tissues of common embryological origin are susceptible to neoplasia from exposure to similar carcinogenic stimuli. In particular, exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV) appears to induce neoplasms in all three locations of the lower female genital tract (cervix, vagina, vulva) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">HPV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPV-associated lesions are often multifocal (originating within several discrete foci at one anatomic site) and multicentric (involving several distinct anatomic sites of the lower genital tract). Although the relationship between HPV infection and intraepithelial neoplasia of the cervix is well known, there are less data available regarding vaginal neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A review of 232 published VaIN cases reported a high prevalence of HPV in these lesions as detected by either polymerase chain reaction or hybrid capture assays for HPV DNA detection: 92.6 percent in VaIN <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3,</span> and 98.5 percent in VaIN 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A worldwide collaborative found a similarly high prevalence of HPV in 96 percent of VaIN <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3,</span> with HPV 16 being the most frequently detected type (59 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Several viral subtypes are associated with VaIN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57576\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57576 \">table 1</a>), with HPV 16 and 18 being the most prevalent HPV types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The prevalence of oncogenic HPV subtypes in the vagina is similar in women who have and have not undergone hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, presence of the cervix does not appear to be necessary for oncogenic HPV to infect the genital tract. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cancer screening tests: Techniques for cervical cytology and human papillomavirus testing&quot;, section on 'HPV testing'</a>.)</p><p>The disparity between the relatively high incidence of CIN and rarity of VaIN in women who test positive for HPV may be due to increased susceptibility of the metaplastic transformation zone of the cervix to oncogenic stimuli. By contrast, the mature, stable, squamous epithelium of the vagina may be less vulnerable to the same stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Women who have been exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero often have squamous metaplasia of the vagina instead of normal columnar epithelium; this observation may explain the increased incidence of VaIN noted in some studies of these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VaIN is usually asymptomatic, although patients can present with postcoital spotting or vaginal discharge. It should be excluded in all women with an abnormal Pap smear who are posthysterectomy or who do not have identifiable cervical lesions that could account for the abnormality.</p><p>The examination should include digital palpation to assess for thickening or irregularity of the vaginal wall and a thorough colposcopic assessment of the entire vagina. In the postmenopausal patient, a few weeks of topical estrogen treatment will often accentuate visualization and improve detection of VaIN. After the insertion of a speculum and the application of acetic acid, lesions will appear as raised or flat white, granular epithelium with sharply demarcated borders and may contain areas of vascular punctation. A biopsy should be taken from any suspicious areas.</p><p>The majority of lesions are located in the upper one-third of the vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Lesions located in post-hysterectomy vaginal recesses can be difficult to visualize; skin hooks may be used to gently evert these areas. The presence of a markedly irregular surface or severe vascular abnormalities with unusual branching suggests an invasive process, which warrants an excisional biopsy. Schiller's or Lugol's iodine solution can be used to detect lesions and confirm boundaries prior to excision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A speculum is placed in the vagina and the planned biopsy site is prepared with iodine (or an alternative preparation solution, if the patient is allergic to iodine). When biopsy is attempted, it is helpful to partially close the speculum to allow the vagina to fold in on itself. Keeping the vagina taut makes performing a biopsy difficult. Local anesthetic is injected (eg, 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> <strong>without</strong> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>).</p><p>For sessile lesions, the biopsy is taken using a cervical biopsy forceps (eg, Kevorkian). Some raised or pedunculated lesions can be grasped with a forceps and biopsied using a fine scissor (eg, Metzenbaum). Hemostasis is usually obtained with application of Monsel's solution or use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a>. If bleeding persists, a suture may be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural course of VaIN has not been fully characterized. Although there have been no prospective studies, several retrospective investigations of various treatment modalities of VaIN have reported that 2 to 8 percent of cases of VaIN progress to invasive vaginal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/13-15,37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15,37-41</a>]. One of the largest retrospective series had only 127 women; there were no cases of progression to invasive disease with a median follow-up of 34 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The rate of persistent or recurrent VaIN did not differ significantly with treatment or by grade: overall (11 percent); without treatment (VaIN 1: 15 percent; VaIN 2,3: 7 percent); with treatment (VaIN 1: 13 percent; VaIN 2,3: 5 percent). </p><p>One study, as an example, found that 9 of 32 patients undergoing vaginectomy for VaIN 3 had foci of invasive carcinoma upon histologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In another study, among women with VaIN 3 who underwent excisional therapy, 4 of 39 (10 percent) were found to vaginal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In another series, 18 of 23 patients with VaIN followed expectantly for at least three years had complete regression of their lesions, three patients had persistent disease, and two (one with VaIN 3 and another with a lower-grade lesion) progressed to invasive carcinoma resulting in an estimated lifetime risk of malignant transformation of VaIN to invasive vaginal carcinoma of 9 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A broad range of treatment options are available for therapy of VaIN: excision, ablation, topical therapy, and radiation of lesions. We manage women with VaIN 1 with close surveillance, rather than treatment. VaIN 1 lesions often regress spontaneously, do not have an established malignant potential, are multifocal, and tend to recur frequently after treatment. Treatment options for VaIN <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3</span> are reviewed in this section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical excision is the mainstay of VaIN treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58294\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58294 \">table 2</a>). This approach permits histologic diagnosis, a significant advantage over other treatments since invasive foci have been detected in up to 28 percent of specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Surgical approaches include local excision, partial vaginectomy, and, rarely, total vaginectomy for extensive and persistent disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginectomy&quot;</a>). Most excisions are performed transvaginally, although at times an open or minimally invasive abdominal approach is necessary. Presurgical administration of topical therapy may reduce lesion size, allow loosening of epithelial-stromal adherence, and enable VaIN to be stripped from the underlying tissue during local excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Partial vaginectomy is required when VaIN is buried in posthysterectomy suture recesses, as these lesions are frequently inaccessible to other forms of treatment.</p><p>Complications of surgical therapy range from shortening or stenosis of the vagina due to wide local excisions, to significant postoperative morbidity following abdominal procedures. The risk of complications is significantly increased in previously irradiated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Electrosurgical loop excision, laser vaginectomy, and ultrasonic surgical aspiration are modifications of the cold-knife approach that may promote rapid healing and reduce the frequency of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>].</p><p>A literature review of surgical treatment of VaIN reported an 18 percent incidence (range, 0 to 50 percent) of recurrent disease during follow-up periods of three months to 18 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58294\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58294 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/6,14,16,22,37,38,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,16,22,37,38,45</a>]. Recurrences of VaIN have also been described in vaginal tissue grafts performed to repair the vagina after vaginectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CO2 laser is one commonly used technique for local tissue ablation. Although approximately one-third of patients will require more than one treatment, the procedure is generally well tolerated, heals satisfactorily, and results in minimal sexual dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57738 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/49-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-57</a>]. Pain and bleeding are the most frequent complications, requiring intervention in 20 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>A randomized controlled trial of carbon dioxide laser versus ultrasonic surgical aspiration involving 110 patients, 52 of whom had VaIN, demonstrated no difference in recurrence of dysplasia during a one-year follow-up period (26 versus 24 percent); there was less postoperative pain and less vulvar scarring with the ultrasonic surgical aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Ablative therapy should <strong>not</strong> be performed if the entire area of abnormal epithelium cannot be visualized or if there is any suspicion of invasion during thorough colposcopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While partial or total vaginectomy appears to be the safest method of treating multifocal high-grade VaIN, a variety of alternate, less radical modalities have been used and studied. Topical application of therapeutic agents has the advantage of treating the entire vaginal mucosa with good coverage of multifocal disease and disease in folds and recesses of the vagina. There are no guidelines clearly defining the ideal treatment for multifocal high-grade VaIN. Topical therapy appears to be an appropriate first-line therapy in women with early lesions and multifocal disease or those who are poor surgical candidates. As with ablation, it is a prerequisite for topical treatment that invasion be excluded by thorough colposcopic examination and biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Imiquimod</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several small case series on the use of topical application of 5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> cream for the treatment of VaIN with promising results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. In these reports, variable imiquimod treatment regimens led to complete response in a considerable percentage of patients with a reported 22 to 29 percent persistence or recurrence rate. In addition, patients who experienced partial response required less extensive excision. In one reported regimen, 5% imiquimod cream is applied to the vaginal lesions three times a week for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The most common adverse events are local burning and soreness, which are generally not severe enough for patients to discontinue treatment. Based on the available data, imiquimod may be a reasonably effective and well-tolerated topical therapy option in the treatment of VaIN. However, larger studies with standardized treatment protocols and longer follow-up are needed to make safe conclusions regarding the effectiveness, recurrence rates, and durability (recurrence-free interval) of this treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluorouracil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure rates are comparable to other techniques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56109\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56109 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/53,55,63-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,55,63-67</a>].</p><p>Complications of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) include vaginal irritation or burning and ulcerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/64,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,68</a>]. A study of insertion of 2 g topical 5% FU cream at night once every two weeks for eight doses for the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in young women reported at least one side effect in 48 percent of women (epithelial disruption, discharge, pain, burning); however, in none of the participants were these side effects so severe that they would interfere with usual activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. External <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a> cream or petroleum jelly can be used as a barrier to help protect against ulceration in adjacent areas. Topical estrogen also may reduce patient discomfort. Columnar metaplasia of the vaginal mucosa can occur after topical FU; the clinical significance of this finding is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Several dosing protocols have been suggested, ranging from twice daily application for 14 days to once weekly for 10 weeks.</p><p>Vaccines directed against human papillomavirus (HPV) are another investigational approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracavitary radiation therapy, while an effective form of treatment, is rarely used because simple resection of the cuff or ablative therapy is usually successful, and it is associated with higher rates of morbidity than other therapies. Radiation therapy is reserved for patients who have failed previous treatments, are poor surgical candidates, or who have extensive, multifocal disease. The optimum dose is unclear. In one study of 14 patients who received high dose rate brachytherapy for VaIN 3, disease regressed, progressed to invasive cancer, or persisted in 12, one, and one patients, respectively, during a median follow-up of 46 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In another series with median follow-up of 77 months, regression occurred in 17 of 22 patients who received medium dose rate brachytherapy for VaIN 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Low dose rate brachytherapy has also been used. A study demonstrated the effectiveness of high dose rate brachytherapy with an 88 percent success rate for the treatment of VaIN in 34 patients with minimal acute side effects and 44 percent with mostly mild late toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Vaginal complications caused by intracavitary radiation include atrophy, stenosis, and shortening. These anatomic distortions can interfere with sexual function and are an impediment to thorough colposcopic follow-up. Bowel and bladder changes and the induction of menopause also can occur. Poor wound healing of irradiated tissue is a concern for patients who subsequently require surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H451662360\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of treatment modality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of therapy of VaIN are prevention of disease progression, while minimizing potential treatment sequelae and improving quality of life. Previous treatment failures, the presence of multifocal disease, the patient's general health and comorbidities, as well as her desire to preserve sexual function are factors to consider in selecting a therapeutic course. Prerequisites for ablative therapy are that the lesion is fully visualized and invasive disease is excluded by biopsy. Thus, if there is uncertainty whether invasive disease has been reliably excluded, excisional therapy is required.</p><p>Complications most commonly associated with medical therapies for VaIN include pain, irritation, and superficial ulcerations. Surgical therapies may induce pain, scarring, and sexual dysfunction.</p><p>No randomized controlled trials comparing treatment modalities for VaIN have been performed. However, a review of 21 available studies on therapeutic modalities found cure rates for VaIN were similar for excision, laser ablation, and an ultrasonic aspirator and dissector (69 to 87.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttreatment surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Posttreatment follow-up with cytological smears every six months for one to two years and annually thereafter is reasonable. Given the high prevalence of HPV in VaIN, there may be a role for HPV testing in the posttreatment follow-up of patients with VaIN similar to that observed post CIN treatment. In a study of 44 women with VaIN, posttreatment HPV testing had a sensitivity of 90 percent and specificity of 78 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Management of these lesions requires long-term follow-up. A study of multicentric dysplasias including CIN with VaIN <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) reported a particularly high rate of residual lesions (55 percent) and recurrence (44 percent) in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H451662378\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunization with HPV vaccination could potentially prevent approximately 70 percent of VaIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. Smoking cessation and complete or proper treatment of CIN, VIN, and adenocarcinoma in situ are other interventions recommended to decrease the likelihood of VaIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) is defined by the presence of squamous cell atypia without invasion. The disease is classified according to the depth of epithelial involvement: VaIN 1 and 2 involve the lower one-third and two-thirds of the epithelium, respectively, and VaIN 3 involves more than two-thirds of the epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68837\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68837 \">picture 1</a>). Carcinoma in situ, which encompasses the full thickness of the epithelium, is included under VaIN 3. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The true incidence of VaIN is unknown, but is estimated at 0.2 to 0.3 cases per 100,000 women in the United States. The average patient is between 43 and 60 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VaIN is usually asymptomatic, although patients can present with postcoital spotting or vaginal discharge. It should be excluded in all women with an abnormal Pap smear who are posthysterectomy or who do not have identifiable cervical lesions that could account for the abnormality. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VaIN is a histologic diagnosis, typically made based upon colposcopically directed biopsy of the vagina. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once high-grade VaIN is diagnosed, invasive disease must be excluded by colposcopy and biopsy, especially before undertaking nonexcisional therapy that does not permit further histologic confirmation of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colposcopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colposcopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical excision, laser ablation, topical therapy, and intracavitary radiation successfully eliminate the lesion in approximately 70 to 80 percent of women; there is a 20 to 30 percent recurrence rate. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of therapy depends upon the patient's general health, surgical risks, desire for vaginal sexual function, presence of multifocal disease, and the certainty with which invasive disease has been excluded. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following therapy, gynecologic examination and vaginal cytology should be performed every six months for one to two years and annually thereafter to evaluate for persistent or progressive disease. Thereafter, patients can be followed at annual intervals. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing may be useful as part of posttreatment surveillance. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Darragh TM, Colgan TJ, Cox JT, et al.
