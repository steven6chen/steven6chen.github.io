The disorder includes symptoms of intrusion, dissociation, negative mood, avoidance, and arousal. Some patients who experience ASD go on to experience posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is diagnosed only after four weeks following exposure to trauma. </p><p>Treatment for ASD is aimed at curtailing symptoms of acute stress responses and preventing their development into PTSD. </p><p>The treatment of ASD is discussed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis of ASD are discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD are also discussed separately.

There are no clinical trials comparing trauma-focused CBT with other interventions with efficacy in the treatment of ASD or prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma-focused CBT is the most extensively studied treatment for ASD with the most extensive evidence of efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H21033148\" class=\"local\">'Trauma-focused CBT'</a> below.)</p><p>CBT for ASD patients should typically be provided by a trained clinician over six weekly sessions of 60 to 90 minutes; additional sessions can be added if necessary. The intervention is typically delivered at least two weeks after trauma exposure. This allows the individual additional time for transient symptoms to abate and for post-trauma stressors to ease. The commencement of therapy should be timed with respect for other stressful events stemming from the trauma. The patient may find it difficult to focus attention on therapy if distracted by trauma-related events or experiences, such as pain, surgery, legal proceedings, relocation, or other stressors.</p><p>For some patients with ASD, it is necessary to delay exposure therapy for several months into the PTSD phase for others, including patients with: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme avoidance or dissociative responses, because these presentations may indicate extreme stress responses that may be complicated by exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A primary response of anger, because anger often does not respond optimally to exposure exercises and may respond better to cognitive therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An acute grief response, because exposure therapy may complicate normal grieving.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Borderline or psychotic features, because these people require containment and exposure may complicate their presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant suicidal risk, because these patients require suicide management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persisting PTSD responses to childhood trauma, because addressing childhood trauma weeks after a recent trauma may be excessively difficult.</p><p/><p>Exposure, a component of trauma-focused CBT, has been found to be more effective when provided as monotherapy than cognitive restructuring in patients with ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-stress-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The trial randomly assigned 90 individuals who experienced trauma and met diagnostic criteria for ASD to receive imaginal and in vivo exposure, cognitive restructuring, or to a waitlist control group. After six weeks of treatment, fewer patients in the exposure group met diagnostic criteria for PTSD as compared with those in the cognitive restructuring or waitlist groups. At six months, patients in the exposure group remained less likely to meet PTSD criteria and were 2.8 times more likely to achieve remission of their initial symptoms than patients in the waitlist group. </p><p>For patients with ASD and acute, intense anxiety, agitation, or sleep disturbance in the immediate period following the traumatic event, we suggest adjunctive treatment with a benzodiazepine rather than other medications. Clinical trials have not yielded sufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of benzodiazepines in comparison with placebo or with other medications in patients who have experienced acute trauma or have been diagnosed with ASD. In our clinical experience, benzodiazepines can reduce symptoms of anxiety, agitation, and sleep disturbance. (See <a href=\"#H21033185\" class=\"local\">'Benzodiazepines'</a> below.)</p><p>Benzodiazepine treatment should be limited to two to four weeks. Prolonged benzodiazepine treatment may be detrimental to adaptation, leading to higher rates of PTSD. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> 0.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in divided doses can be used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3504909137\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychosocial interventions that have been tested either to treat symptoms of acute stress disorder (ASD) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to prevent the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) include trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, cognitive therapy, and psychological debriefing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21033148\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma-focused CBT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma-focused CBT for ASD typically includes patient education, cognitive restructuring, and exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults#H1118664211\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient education &ndash;</strong> Patients are educated about stressful reactions to trauma, trauma-related disorders, and treatment options.

Re-experiencing the trauma through exposure allows it to be emotionally processed so that it can become less painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-stress-disorder-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. By repeatedly confronting traumatic memories or safe reminders of a traumatic experience, the individual can experience them safely, until they no longer elicit such strong emotions and can see that they are not dangerous.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Trauma-focused CBT for ASD optimally includes both imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure. In imaginal exposure, the patient provides a detailed narrative of his or her traumatic experience in which the patient orally relives the traumatic experience with the therapist (usually for at least 30 minutes), with the intention of achieving extinction learning. By reliving the memory repeatedly, the patient can learn that the salient reminder of the trauma (eg, the memory) is no longer a threat and does not result in aversive outcomes. Based on a similar mechanism, in vivo exposure is conducted to ensure that the patient is not avoiding feared situations in their daily life, thereby consolidating the learning that reminders are no longer signaling threat. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Administration</strong> &ndash; Administration of trauma-focused CBT is discussed earlier in the topic.

This could suggest that cognitive processing therapy is not as effective as other types of trauma-focused CBT for the disorder; however, our conclusions are tempered by the trial&rsquo;s small sample size and the absence of head-to-head trials of cognitive processing therapy and other trauma-focused CBT interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H778995456\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy in preventing PTSD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma-focused CBT has been found to reduce the likelihood of subsequent PTSD in people with acute stress disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-stress-disorder-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A meta-analysis of five randomized clinical trials found that CBT reduced the proportion of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD at six months (relative risk = 0.56 [95% CI 0.42-0.76]), with continued benefit seen at three years of follow-up.

At follow-up 4 and 12 weeks post-trauma, prolonged exposure led to a greater reduction of PTSD symptoms compared with the control intervention.
