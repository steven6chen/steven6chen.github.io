Death from cardiovascular disease is also the most common cause of graft loss.</p><p>This topic reviews the risk factors of cardiovascular disease among renal transplant recipients. The epidemiology of cardiovascular disease following transplantation, cardiovascular outcomes compared with dialysis patients, and the evaluation of renal transplant candidates are discussed elsewhere.

Fifty to 60 percent of posttransplant deaths are directly attributable to cardiovascular disease, with an incidence of ischemic heart disease of approximately 1 per 100 person-years at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death with graft function after transplant and accounts for 30 percent of graft loss from death overall, with the greatest rates early after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Notably, the incidence of cardiovascular death after transplant appears to be declining somewhat despite the aging and increased comorbidity burdens among transplant recipients, which may reflect advances in medical management or competing risks of cancer and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The high rate of cardiovascular deaths in the transplant population is due in part to the large number of diabetic patients in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population, who are at markedly increased cardiovascular risk, compared with nondiabetic transplant recipients. As an example, in one study of 933 predominantly living-donor transplant recipients, cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of death among diabetic recipients; by contrast, most deaths among nondiabetic recipients were due to infection, malignancy, or other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>However, the cardiovascular risk among transplant recipients who do not have ESRD related to diabetes is still higher than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The increased cardiovascular risk is due to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An exacerbation of traditional risk factors present in the general population by immunosuppressive drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51988\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51988 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nontraditional risk factors related to immunosuppressive agents or to chronic kidney disease</p><p/><p>Traditional risk factors for coronary heart disease after renal transplantation were investigated in a report of 403 patients who received 464 kidney transplants during a 10-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. New atherosclerotic complications developed in 16 percent of patients.

Among nearly 36,000 patients, the incidence of MI at 6, 12, and, 36 months was 4.3, 5.2, and 11.1 percent, respectively. The principal risk factors were increased age, recipient of kidneys from older donors and deceased donors, delayed allograft function, and the presence of pretransplant comorbidities, including diabetes, angina, peripheral vascular disease, and MI. The diagnosis of posttransplant diabetes and the development of allograft failure were also significantly associated with the development of an MI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a similar study of 53,297 patients, a markedly increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was observed early after transplantation, less than three months postsurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Compared with waitlist patients, the risk also varied by recipients of a deceased-donor kidney (relative risk [RR] 3.57, 95% CI 3.21-3.96) and living-donor kidney (RR 2.81, 95% CI 2.31-3.42).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of the placebo arm of the Assessment of LEscol in Renal Transplantation (ALERT) study, independent risk factors for nonfatal MI by multivariate analysis were preexisting coronary heart disease (hazard ratio [HR] 3.69), total cholesterol level (HR 1.55 per 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> and prior acute rejection (HR 2.36) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The individual Framingham risk factors are significantly associated with cardiovascular risk among kidney transplant recipients, but some effect sizes are increased among such patients.</p><p>This prediction error is greatest among patients at highest risk and is driven in part by an underestimate of diabetes-related risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/16,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,28</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 1124 kidney transplant recipients with stable graft function at one year, the observed increase in risk conferred by diabetes was greater in transplant recipients compared with the Framingham Heart Study population (RRs of 2.8 versus 1.5, respectively, among men, and 5.4 versus 1.8, respectively, among women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

This was entirely due to an underestimate among high-risk patients (defined as greater than 20 percent risk of event at 10 years according to the Framingham heart score). The risk score performed well among low-risk patients (less than 20 percent risk at 10 years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective cohort study of 540 transplant recipients, the Framingham risk score underestimated cardiac events but not stroke, with ratios of observed-to-predicted cardiac events of 1.64 and 0.96, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As noted in the previous study, the risk score performed least well among the highest risk patients; subgroup analysis showed higher observed-to-predicted cardiac event ratios among patients with pretransplant diabetes, prior cardiac disease, or both (2.12, 2.00, and 2.74, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H274587\"><span class=\"h3\">Biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of biomarkers such as cardiac troponins may allow more accurate cardiovascular risk stratification than is provided by currently available methods.

In one study using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing, among 27,372 individuals who underwent kidney transplantation between 1997 and 1999, 20 percent were obese (body mass index [BMI] 30 to 35) or morbidly obese (BMI &ge;35), and an additional 30 percent were classified as overweight (BMI 25 to 29) though not obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Weight gain after transplant is common and may be related to improved appetite with reversal of uremia and relatively high steroid doses in the peritransplant period, but is also associated with physical inactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

In one study of 337 renal transplant recipients, one-third had metabolic syndrome by the first transplant anniversary, whereas only 20 percent had metabolic syndrome before transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

In a study of nearly 52,000 patients in the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) registry, the adjusted risk of cardiac death increased at both low BMI (AHR 1.3 for BMI of &lt;20) and high BMI (AHR 1.2 for BMI 30 to 32; AHR 1.4 for BMI &gt;36), compared with the reference group with BMI 22 to 24 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Obesity also increases the risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation.

Although the use of multiple cardiovascular medications was higher in patients with a previous cardiovascular event compared with patients with no previous cardiovascular disease, fewer than 75 percent of patients with previous cardiovascular disease were using a statin or antiplatelet agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of integrated Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) registry and pharmacy billing claims data to characterize cardiovascular medication prescriptions early after myocardial infarction (MI) showed that, within the first 60 days after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), prescriptions for beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents, ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitors/ARBs,</span> and statins were submitted in only 83, 48, 65, and 72 percent, respectively, which was roughly comparable with nontransplant patients matched by demographic and measured clinical characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Linked OPTN and pharmacy data from 2005 to 2010 demonstrated that approximately 18 to 25 percent of kidney transplant recipients were treated with an ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/ARB,</span> and 25 to 45 percent received a statin at one year posttransplant, depending upon renal function and immunosuppressive regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,89</a>].</p><p/><p>While there may be legitimate reasons for not prescribing potentially cardioprotective medications in transplanted patients (eg, allograft dysfunction, hyperkalemia and anemia may limit use of ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitors/ARBs),</span> these studies suggest potential room for improvement in the treatment of cardiovascular risks among high-risk transplant recipients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among kidney transplant recipients. Death from cardiovascular disease is also the most common cause of graft loss. Transplant recipients have a lower risk of cardiovascular events compared with waitlisted patients on dialysis, but a much higher risk compared with the general population. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Framingham risk score underestimates the risk of cardiovascular events among kidney transplant patients. Although the individual Framingham risk factors are significantly associated with cardiovascular risk among kidney transplant recipients, the effect sizes are increased among such patients, especially among patients at highest risk. (See <a href=\"#H274580\" class=\"local\">'Framingham risk score'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional risk factors present in the general population also exist in renal transplant recipients. These factors may be exacerbated by immunosuppressive medications. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Overview of cardiovascular risk'</a> above and <a href=\"#H44613340\" class=\"local\">'Individual risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyslipidemia remains a significant problem in the transplant population. Corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, rapamycin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> elevate serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Dyslipidemia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension is caused or worsened by calcineurin inhibitors and, to a lesser extent because of rapid dose reduction, corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both pretransplant diabetes and new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) are associated with the risk of posttransplant cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure. Antirejection medications that contribute to NODAT include glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors, and mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes mellitus'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) in renal transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced renal function after transplantation and dialysis vintage prior to transplantation are significant cardiovascular risk factors after transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the general and transplant populations, smoking increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. With smoking cessation, the increased risk dissipates over time. Among all transplant recipients, we recommend complete smoking cessation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Smoking'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-tobacco-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of tobacco use&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiomyopathy, either with or without clinical heart failure, is common among kidney transplant recipients and is associated with mortality. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is second only to infection as a cause of hospitalization after kidney transplantation. Risk factors for CHF after transplantation include age, diabetes, anemia, and hypertension and decreased graft function. (See <a href=\"#H274267\" class=\"local\">'Congestive heart failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary and secondary measures to prevent cardiovascular events are underutilized in transplant recipients.
