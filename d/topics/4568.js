It puts you at risk for a heart attack and other forms of heart disease. In coronary heart disease, the arteries that bring blood to the heart get clogged with fatty deposits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61785\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61785 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2050681\"><span class=\"h1\">Does coronary heart disease happen in women?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. In fact, coronary heart disease is the most common cause of death in women in the United States. Women often worry about getting cancer, especially breast cancer, as they get older. But many more women die from heart disease than from breast cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2050696\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of coronary heart disease in women?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of coronary heart disease are often the same in both women and men. The most common symptom is some type of chest pain. Men usually describe their chest pain as a feeling of tightness in the chest. Women often say their chest pain feels sharp or burning. In men, symptoms are usually brought on by exercise. In women, symptoms can happen during rest or sleep. They can also be brought on by stress.</p><p>Some women have no symptoms of coronary heart disease until they start to have a heart attack. A heart attack is when one of the arteries that bring blood to the heart gets blocked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60394\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60394 \">figure 2</a>). In women, the most common symptoms of a heart attack are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling much more tired than usual</p><p/><p>These are different from the symptoms people usually think of when they think of someone having a heart attack. Sometimes, women also have these &quot;classic&quot; symptoms when they have a heart attack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F85777\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85777 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain, pressure, or discomfort</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the neck, arm, throat, back, or other part of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating or having cold, clammy skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Racing heart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or light-headed</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2050745\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for coronary heart disease in women?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests to check for coronary heart disease are usually the same in women and men. They can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests, including tests to check cholesterol levels</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;) &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stress test &ndash; During this test, a doctor records your ECG while you exercise on a treadmill or bike, or get medicine to make your heart pump faster.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart as it beats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nuclear heart testing &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a small amount of radioactive material into your vein through a needle. Then a camera takes pictures of the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization (also called &quot;cardiac cath&quot;) &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in your leg or arm. Then he or she moves the tube up to your heart. When the tube is in place, he or she can do tests or unblock a clogged artery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2818603925\"><span class=\"h1\">How is coronary heart disease in women treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, coronary heart disease is treated the same in women and men. Treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Some medicines relieve chest pain. These include nitrates, beta blockers, and others. Other medicines lower your risk of heart attacks and help you live longer. These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines called statins, which lower cholesterol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to lower blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Aspirin</a> or other medicines that help prevent blood clots</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure to reopen a clogged artery, called &quot;stenting&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to re-route blood around a clogged artery, called &quot;bypass surgery&quot; or &quot;coronary artery bypass grafting&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73589 \">figure 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2050783\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to help prevent coronary heart disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help prevent coronary heart disease, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Work with your doctor to get medical conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes under control.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise at least 30 minutes a day, on most days of the week.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat lots of fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy products, and not a lot of meat or fatty foods.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit your alcohol intake to no more than 1 drink a day.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get treated for depression, if you are depressed. Depression increases your chance of getting heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2050798\"><span class=\"h1\">Can taking hormones help prevent coronary heart disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors do not think that taking hormones like estrogen helps prevent coronary heart disease. They do not recommend that women who have gone through menopause (stopped having periods) take estrogen to prevent coronary heart disease. But doctors sometimes prescribe estrogen for a short period of time to help with menopause symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2050813\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pleuritic-chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pleuritic chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diet and health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cardiac catheterization (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nuclear-heart-testing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nuclear heart testing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chest pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diet and health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
