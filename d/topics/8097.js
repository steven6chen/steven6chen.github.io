However, transfused blood is a foreign substance that has the potential to elicit an immune response, which can lead to destruction of the transfused RBCs (ie, immune hemolysis). Transfused RBCs are also susceptible to lysis from mechanical perturbations and other stresses including temperature extremes, osmotic pressure, and chemical injury. Other transfusion reactions can sometimes be mistaken for transfusion-associated hemolysis, and other forms of hemolysis can sometimes be mistakenly attributed to a transfusion. Determining whether hemolysis is present and transfusion-associated, and determining the cause of hemolysis associated with a blood transfusion, are important for the management of the immediate event and for reducing the risk of future transfusion-associated immune hemolysis. </p><p>The causes, evaluation, differential diagnosis, and management of immune hemolysis associated with blood transfusion are discussed here. </p><p>Other transfusion reactions, and the approach to the patient when the cause of a transfusion reaction is unknown, are discussed in separate UpToDate topic reviews: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion reaction of unknown cause &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunologic reactions other than hemolysis &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Important aspects of pretransfusion testing to reduce the likelihood of a hemolytic transfusion reaction are discussed separately.

HTRs can range in severity from instantaneous, massive, intravascular hemolysis that may cause disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock, and renal failure to mild, clinically inapparent hemolysis weeks after the transfusion. The main determinants of severity and timing are the specific RBC antigens targeted and the nature of the alloantibodies (IgG versus IgM, sub-class of IgG, ability of the antibody to bind complement) as well as their strength (titer). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H776999573\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of RBC destruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute HTRs (AHTRs) are usually due to ABO incompatibility, most often the result of clerical or procedural error [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. Pathologically, HTRs are associated with accelerated destruction of RBCs. In the most common situation, transfusion of RBCs leads to hemolysis of the transfused cells by a host immune response against a foreign (to the recipient) antigen on the these RBCs. </p><p>In some cases, transfusion of plasma-containing antibodies directed against a recipient's RBC antigen leads to hemolysis of the recipient's RBCs. This is less common primarily because the incompatible donor plasma is instantly diluted upon transfusion, reducing the strength of the transfused antibodies. Rarely, both donor and recipient RBCs can be destroyed, as in hyperhemolytic crisis. The mechanism by which hemolysis of RBCs lacking the implicated antigen (bystander hemolysis) occurs is not well understood. (See <a href=\"#H3043777709\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation of DHTR'</a> below.)</p><p>The first event in a typical AHTR involves binding of recipient antibodies to antigens on the transfused RBCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111852\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111852 \">figure 1</a>). This requires that the recipient has previously been exposed to the implicated antigen (or a cross-reacting antigen) and has generated antibodies capable of opsonizing the RBCs. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the case of ABO incompatibility, type O, A, and B individuals undergo constant stimulation to produce antibodies that react with the antigens that they lack (A and B antigens on type A, B, or AB cells), due to exposure to intestinal microorganisms that are similar enough to A and B to elicit molecular mimicry. These naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B antibodies in type O recipients are typically of the IgM class, but also can include IgG. These IgM antibodies can rapidly fix complement and can cause massive, immediate, intravascular hemolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;, section on 'ABO blood group system'</a> and <a href=\"#H2336496090\" class=\"local\">'Site of RBC destruction (intravascular or extravascular)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On occasion, an AHTR may occur when an individual with blood group A, B, or AB is transfused with a blood product (eg, plasma, apheresis platelets) containing a high titer of ABO alloantibodies (eg, high titer anti-A given to an A or AB recipient, or high titer anti-B given to a B or AB recipient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies to most other RBC antigens are elicited by prior transfusion or other forms of exposure to allogeneic RBCs such as pregnancy or sharing of intravenous needles. Only a small amount of exposure (&lt;1 mL of blood) is required to elicit an antibody response, although this can be variable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>These antibodies may persist in the circulation at high enough levels to cause immediate hemolysis when they encounter the antigen, leading to an acute HTR. (See <a href=\"#H354742\" class=\"local\">'Acute hemolytic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In some cases, the titer of antibodies may decline to undetectable levels, and re-exposure to the antigen will cause an anamnestic response over the ensuing several days, leading to a delayed HTR. (See <a href=\"#H354791\" class=\"local\">'Delayed hemolytic reactions'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The abundance of the antigen on the RBC surface also influences the severity of the reaction. Antigen density varies significantly for different RBC antigens. As an example, ABO antigens are present at approximately 200,000 to 800,000 per cell, while Kell antigens are present at approximately 3000 to 6000 per cell, a 100-fold difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/1,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15-17</a>]. RBC antigens and their capacity for eliciting HTRs are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>In some cases, binding of the alloantibody to the RBCs is accompanied by binding of complement components (eg, C3b), with resulting activation of the complement cascade. Antibodies and complement proteins can both act as opsonins and can both facilitate phagocytosis and destruction of the foreign cells by macrophages. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=igg-subclasses-physical-properties-genetics-and-biologic-functions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgG subclasses: Physical properties, genetics, and biologic functions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to promoting phagocytosis, macrophage activation also leads to production of proinflammatory cytokines that can elicit a systemic response, including fever, chills, abdominal or flank pain, and other nonspecific symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111852\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111852 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. RBC destruction is responsible for the drop in hemoglobin level (or failure of the hemoglobin level to rise with transfusion), and cytokines as well as free hemoglobin in the circulation cause the systemic manifestations of the HTR. (See <a href=\"#H354773\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation of AHTR'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3043777709\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation of DHTR'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2336496090\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of RBC destruction (intravascular or extravascular)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lysis of RBCs can occur intravascularly (within the circulation) or extravascularly (within the reticuloendothelial system). The principal determinants of the site of RBC destruction are the antibody concentration on the RBC surface and whether the antibody (especially if IgG) is able to fix complement, leading to formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which causes the RBCs to lyse osmotically in the circulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111905\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111905 \">figure 2</a>). The abundance of <span class=\"nowrap\">splenic/hepatic</span> macrophages and their state of activation may also play a role. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravascular hemolysis</strong> &ndash; Intravascular hemolysis occurs when the antibody against the RBC antigen is capable of binding and activating complement. The terminal, lytic phase of complement activation, involving components C5 to C9 (the MAC), creates multiple holes in the RBC membrane that lead to lysis. The lysis occurs in the circulation, leading to release of free hemoglobin, which in turn can contribute to shock, with hypotension; nephrotoxicity, with oliguric renal failure; and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombosis. Intravascular hemolysis is thus more acute, severe, and potentially life-threatening than extravascular hemolysis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extravascular hemolysis</strong> &ndash; Extravascular hemolysis occurs when the antibody against the RBC antigen opsonizes the RBCs, which leads to their sequestration and phagocytosis by macrophages and other phagocytes of the reticuloendothelial system, highly concentrated in the liver and spleen. The complete destruction of the antibody-coated RBC may take several passes through the macrophage system, with bits of membrane being removed with each pass, and the annealing of the remaining membrane resulting in its becoming an osmotically fragile spherocyte, or microspherocyte prior to its removal from circulation. Hemoglobin is released intracellularly into the macrophages, bound to ferritin, and stored. Clinical manifestations of extravascular hemolysis are generally milder, often marked only by low grade fever and hyperbilirubinemia, though the potential for severe hemolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal failure does exist.</p><p/><p>In many cases, the RBC lysis is not purely intravascular or extravascular, especially when the formation of the MAC is partially inhibited <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when the reticuloendothelial system becomes overwhelmed. Additional information about the different complement pathways and associated proteins is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are major clinical implications of the site (or principal site) of RBC lysis. Both lead to a drop in hemoglobin (or lack of the expected rise with transfusion) and laboratory markers of hemolysis such as increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased indirect bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin. Intravascular lysis can also lead to diffuse pain, acute renal failure due, in part, to the toxicity of free hemoglobin, and DIC. (See <a href=\"#H354773\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation of AHTR'</a> below.)</p><p>Assessment of the site of RBC destruction and key features of management of intravascular hemolysis related to transfusion are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H354779\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and immediate management of AHTR'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2288695248\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of hemolysis (acute or delayed)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other transfusion reactions, hemolytic reactions can be classified as acute or delayed based on how soon after transfusion they occur. Acute reactions are those that occur during the transfusion or within 24 hours after the transfusion has been administered. Delayed reactions are those that occur more than one day following completion of the transfusion. Delayed hemolytic reactions typically occur one to two weeks following transfusion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute HTR (AHTR)</strong> &ndash; Acute HTRs typically occur early during the transfusion, after administration of as little as a few mL of incompatible blood due to ABO incompatibility. In AHTRs, the temporal relationship to the transfusion is clear, but it may initially be challenging to determine what type of reaction is occurring. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delayed HTR (DHTR)</strong> &ndash; Delayed HTRs can occur one to two weeks, and as many as four weeks following transfusion. For hospitalized patients, this is often after the patient has left the hospital and is no longer having frequent laboratory monitoring. Many DHTRs go undiagnosed. In DHTRs that are clinically severe, the presence of anemia and hemolysis is often clear, but it may be challenging to determine whether or not the transfusion is responsible.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1336727325\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of acute HTRs (AHTRs) has been estimated at approximately 1 in 70,000 per blood product transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of transfusion-associated deaths in the United States from 1976 to 1985, acute hemolysis was the most common cause of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There were 158 fatalities from AHTRs, 26 fatalities from delayed HTRs (DHTRs), and 6 fatalities from non-immune hemolysis. Of the AHTRs, 131 (83 percent) were due to ABO incompatibility errors, mostly involving a group O recipient who received non-group O blood. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2014 review of deaths related to transfusion, hemolysis accounted for 38 of 176 deaths (21 percent), which was less common than other transfusion reactions such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI; 41 percent) and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO; 22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Of the deaths due to hemolysis, one-third (7 percent of the total) were due to ABO incompatibility and the remaining two-thirds (14 percent of the total) to non-ABO reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based on a 2016 clinical practice guideline from the AABB, the likelihood of a fatal AHTR is approximately 1 in 1,972,000 (5 per 10 million) per RBC unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This represents a decline from the likelihood of approximately 1 in 1,250,000 (8 per 10 million) reported in a 2012 AABB guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p>The prevalence of DHTRs is likely to be underestimated since many patients are asymptomatic; frequency estimates range from approximately 1:800 to 1:11,000. The large range exists because some studies reporting DHTRs also include delayed serologic transfusion reactions (DSTRs; reactions in which a new RBC alloantibody becomes apparent but there is no hemolysis) (see <a href=\"#H2537147499\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis of DHTR'</a> below). </p><p>Hemolytic transfusion reactions occur most often after transfusion of RBCs, but they can also occur after transfusion of other products (eg, Fresh Frozen Plasma, platelets, granulocytes), because RBCs or anti-RBC antibodies may be present in these products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H776999573\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of RBC destruction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354742\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE HEMOLYTIC REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute HTR (AHTR) refers to transfusion-associated hemolysis that occurs during the transfusion or within the first 24 hours after transfusion. AHTR is a medical emergency that requires immediate cessation of the transfusion, if still in progress, as well as immediate evaluation and interventions to reduce the risks of serious organ damage to the patient and other potentially affected patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354773\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation of AHTR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of AHTR depends on the type of incompatibility, blood product, and volume transfused; together these determine the degree of hemolysis. &#160; </p><p>The most common presentation of AHTR is after red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and the most commonly implicated RBC antigens are those of the ABO blood group, due to clerical error, as noted above (see <a href=\"#H1336727325\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above). A very small proportion are caused by other antigens, including those in the Kell, Duffy, and Jk blood groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The blood group antigens are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;</a>.). </p><p>Rarely, a recipient of a plasma-containing product (eg, Plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy [PF24], Thawed Plasma, Fresh Frozen Plasma [FFP]; platelets) or of; intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) or Rh(D) immune globulin may develop an AHTR due to antibodies in the plasma or immunoglobulin product that react with the recipient's RBCs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-plasma-components#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of plasma components&quot;, section on 'Risks'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravenous immune globulin: Adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Hemolysis'</a>.)</p><p>ABO-associated AHTRs often occur during the early minutes of the transfusion, although they may not be immediately appreciated (eg, if the patient is under anesthesia). An ABO-associated AHTR may be suspected when a patient develops chills, fever, hypotension, hemoglobinuria, renal failure, back pain, or signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The serum or urine may be pink due to the presence of free hemoglobin. In a patient under anesthesia or in a coma, oozing from venipuncture sites due to DIC or change in the urine color to red or brown due to hemoglobinuria may be the only finding.</p><p>The presence of hemoglobinemia (red or dark plasma), hemoglobinuria (red or dark urine), DIC, shock, and acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis are indicative of intravascular hemolysis. (See <a href=\"#H2336496090\" class=\"local\">'Site of RBC destruction (intravascular or extravascular)'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.) </p><p>However, it is important to note that the classic presenting triad of fever, flank pain, and red or brown urine is rarely seen as a triad; patients may present with isolated fever and chills, sometimes accompanied by pain along the infusion vein and a feeling of anxiety. </p><p>In addition to laboratory findings of immune hemolysis, the patient may have spherocytes or microspherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, and urinary hemosiderin on urine analysis (although these are much more common in delayed HTRs [DHTRs] than in AHTRs).</p><p>Recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (eg, with hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]) may also develop HTRs as their blood type changes. This subject is discussed separately.

The evaluation occurs at the bedside and in the transfusion department or blood bank. Every hospital has a protocol for evaluating transfusion reactions that should be followed rigorously. The goal is to determine if hemolysis has occurred, to distinguish among possible causes, and to stabilize the patient. The initial steps are similar to those for any suspected acute transfusion reaction, and include immediately stopping the transfusion, providing hemodynamic support, and contacting the transfusion service (or following the institutional protocol) to help with the evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96323\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96323 \">algorithm 1</a>). Many of the initial interventions such as vigorous hydration and hemodynamic support are made immediately, without waiting for the results of laboratory testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction#H11614097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;, section on 'Immediate actions (all patients)'</a>.)</p><p>The initial clerical check and notification of the transfusion service is critical for the evaluation of the index patient as well as other potentially affected patients (eg, if the bag was mislabeled or if two products for two recipients were switched accidentally). Although less likely, obvious causes of non-immune hemolysis should also be evaluated (eg, a check of the transfusion setup to confirm that the blood was not co-administered with a hypotonic fluid, leading to osmotic lysis; if a blood warmer was used, a temperature check to make sure the blood was not heated to a temperature that could cause thermal lysis). (See <a href=\"#H809056280\" class=\"local\">'Non-immune hemolysis from RBC injury'</a> below.)</p><p>Laboratory testing for AHTR, done in consultation with the transfusion service, should be performed on blood drawn from the patient&rsquo;s opposite arm (not the one used for the transfusion), or, if this cannot be done, from a separate site on the same arm. The following should be included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat ABO compatibility testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional antibody studies if ABO incompatibility is excluded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat crossmatch with pre- and post-transfusion specimens using an indirect antiglobulin (IAT; also called indirect Coombs) method. IAT is likely to be positive in an AHTR that is not caused by ABO incompatibility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) testing (DAT), which may be positive in AHTR but may be negative in ABO incompatibility or if hemolysis is so severe that all RBCs with antibody on the surface have been lysed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual inspection of the serum and urine for pink or dark brown color. The serum should be analyzed for free hemoglobin, and a urine sample should be saved in case analysis of the urine for free hemoglobin is required. Pink or dark brown serum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine and a positive test for free hemoglobin will be present in severe intravascular hemolysis but not in extravascular hemolysis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for hemolysis with serum haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin levels. In hemolysis, haptoglobin will be low; LDH and bilirubin will be increased, although the increase in unconjugated bilirubin may be delayed and is more likely to be helpful in evaluating the patient for a DHTR than for an AHTR.

The hemoglobin level should be tested serially in case another transfusion is needed, and the pretransfusion testing should be repeated to avoid transfusing RBCs that express the implicated antigen.</p><p>AHTRs are by definition self-limited, although the course is highly dependent on the volume of blood transfused and whether or not shock, DIC, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal failure develop. The importance of reducing the risk of these complications provides the rationale for the importance of early detection in order to prevent death or long-term complications.

RBCs cannot tolerate temperatures above 40&deg;C (104&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. When it occurs, exposure to high temperatures is typically caused by improper use of a blood warming device. Excessive heat can damage the RBC membrane, leading to changes in viscosity, fluidity, deformability, permeability, and osmotic fragility. Heat-damaged RBCs that have not already lysed are rapidly cleared from the circulation by the spleen. Freezing injury occurs when RBCs are exposed to below-freezing temperatures in the absence of a cryoprotective agent such as glycerol or DMSO. This can lead to dehydration injury if the freezing is slow or ice crystal formation if the freezing is rapid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Inadequately deglycerolized RBCs can undergo intravascular osmotic lysis; one such circumstance was reported to have been the cause of death in a 1000 gram infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osmotic injury</strong> &ndash; Osmotic injury occurs when RBCs are exposed to a hypotonic solution. This is also extremely rare. It may result from inadvertent mixture with a drug or hypotonic solution (eg, 5% dextrose, half-normal saline, distilled water). Hypo-osmolar solutions permit free water to enter the RBCs, causing them to swell and lyse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mechanical injury</strong> &ndash; Mechanical injury occurs when RBCs are exposed to physical trauma. During transfusion, this may result from especially fine gauge needles, kinked or twisted intravenous lines, mechanical pumps, or defective blood administration sets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p>Like immune hemolysis, the patient with these other forms of RBC injury can have an acute systemic reaction with signs of intravascular hemolysis, including fever, chills, back pain, free hemoglobin in the serum or urine, increased LDH, high bilirubin, and low haptoglobin.

Blood from donors with sickle cell trait is less likely to be transfused in the era of universal prestorage leukoreduction than it was previously, since most blood from donors with sickle cell trait will have problems such as clogging the leukoreduction filter, rendering the unit unsuitable for transfusion. As a result, this clinical situation is rarely encountered.</p><p/><p>Like an AHTR, recipients of RBCs that hemolyze when transfused can have evidence of hemolysis on laboratory testing.

Thus, in patients with underlying AIHA, lysis of the transfused RBCs by the autoantibody can either mimic or mask alloantibody-induced hemolysis. Like transfusion-associated HTRs, AIHA is associated with laboratory evidence of immune hemolysis, including increased LDH, high indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin, and positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) testing. Unlike an AHTR, in AIHA, the hemolysis was present before the transfusion, and often could be detected on pretransfusion testing. AIHA is typically characterized by extravascular hemolysis, and thus AIHA typically has a positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT) and does not have free hemoglobin in the serum or urine. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cold agglutinin disease</strong> &ndash; Cold agglutinin disease is a form of AIHA in which the autoantibodies cause agglutination of RBCs at cold temperatures. Cold agglutinin disease is rare; it is most often seen in elderly females <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in association with infection, especially those involving mycoplasma pneumoniae and Epstein-Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis). In individuals with cold agglutinins, infusion of blood at refrigerator temperatures may exacerbate hemolysis. All intravenous infusions for these patients, including blood, should be warmed using approved blood warming devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-agglutinin-disease#H13823516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold agglutinin disease&quot;, section on 'Special precautions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)</strong> &ndash; PNH is an acquired disorder characterized by clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells that lack glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins, some of which prevent spontaneous complement-mediated lysis (intravascular and extravascular) of RBCs. Because of the increased sensitivity of the recipient's RBCs to complement, any antigen-antibody reaction capable of activating complement (eg, donor RBC-recipient antibody; donor WBC-recipient antibody; recipient RBC-donor antibody) can trigger hemolysis in a recently transfused patient with PNH. Various methods to reduce this effect have been used (eg, washing RBCs to remove donor plasma, leukoreduction to remove donor WBCs), but none are supported by high quality evidence. Leukoreduction is standard practice and is recommended on general principles, especially if a future hematopoietic cell transplant is contemplated. We generally do not advocate washing.

Like HTRs, drug-induced hemolysis is characterized by findings of hemolysis, including increased LDH, high indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin, and in some cases a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) test. Unlike an AHTR, drug-induced hemolysis has a temporal relationship to drug administration rather than the transfusion, and can be treated by eliminating the drug exposure.

These reactions are most commonly due to an anamnestic response to a foreign RBC antigen to which the recipient was previously exposed. Common routes of previous exposure include prior transfusions and pregnancy; less common routes include hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplantation, or sharing of intravenous needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. RBC antigens most commonly responsible for DHTRs include those of the Kidd or Rh system.</p><p>DHTRs, characterized by extravascular hemolysis, (see <a href=\"#H2336496090\" class=\"local\">'Site of RBC destruction (intravascular or extravascular)'</a> above), are often clinically silent. Patients can present with low grade fever or jaundice. Laboratory evaluation reveals evidence of hemolysis, including increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and indirect bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, and a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) test. The hemoglobin level may be lower than expected given the patient's clinical picture and timing of the transfusion. If the DHTR has been ongoing, the reticulocyte count may be correspondingly increased in patients with a normally functioning bone marrow. In addition to laboratory findings of immune hemolysis, the patient may have spherocytes or microspherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, and urinary hemosiderin on urine analysis. </p><p>When DHTRs are clinically silent, the diagnosis is often made by the blood bank because of a new positive antiglobulin (Coombs) test and a new positive antibody screen that are found when more blood is ordered. This provides the rationale for repeating pretransfusion testing in an individual who has recently received a transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretransfusion-testing-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the setting where an asymptomatic, recently transfused patient is found to have either a new positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) or antibody screen, a thorough evaluation is indicated to enable the clinician to distinguish between a delayed serologic transfusion reaction (DSTR) and a DHTR.

This situation is generally indicative of an acquired alloantibody to an antigen in the Kidd (Jk) blood group system, as these antibodies (though IgG) can be capable of binding complement, which is necessary for causing intravascular hemolysis. (See <a href=\"#H354773\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation of AHTR'</a> above.)</p><p>Hyperhemolytic crisis is a very rare type of DHTR in which hemolysis of transfused RBCs is accompanied by hemolysis of the patient's own RBCs.

Treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) and glucocorticoids has been reported to be successful in some cases, as discussed in more detail separately.

The main determinants of severity, site of hemolysis (intravascular or extravascular) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111905\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111905 \">figure 2</a>), and timing are the specific RBC antigens and the nature and titer of alloantibodies present at the time of transfusion. (See <a href=\"#H2548406591\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HTRs are rare, and getting rarer, but fatal reactions continue to happen on the order of 5 events per 10 million transfusions. HTRs are most common with RBC transfusion but can also occur with plasma-containing products. (See <a href=\"#H1336727325\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute HTRs (AHTRs) are HTRs that occur during or within 24 hours of completing the transfusion. AHTR is a medical emergency that requires immediate cessation of the transfusion if still in progress, as well as immediate evaluation and interventions to reduce the risks of serious organ damage to the patient and other potentially affected patients. (See <a href=\"#H354742\" class=\"local\">'Acute hemolytic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common presentation of AHTR is after RBC transfusion with ABO blood group incompatibility, due to clerical error. Immediate goals are to determine if hemolysis has occurred, to distinguish among possible causes, and to stabilize the patient. The initial steps include immediately stopping the transfusion, providing hemodynamic support, and contacting the transfusion service to help with the evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96323\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96323 \">algorithm 1</a>). The untransfused blood and tubing should not be discarded. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laboratory testing for AHTR includes repeat ABO compatibility testing and in some cases additional antibody testing; inspection of the serum and urine for pink color due to free hemoglobin; testing for hemolysis (haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and bilirubin levels); and direct and indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) testing. Some individuals may require testing for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hyperkalemia, and renal insufficiency, and nephrologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematologist consultation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The differential diagnosis of AHTR includes other acute transfusion reactions and other causes of hemolysis, either caused by, exacerbated by, or unrelated to the transfusion. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed HTRs (DHTRs) are HTRs that occur more than 24 hour past the transfusion, typically due to an anamnestic response to a previously encountered foreign RBC antigen (eg, through pregnancy, prior transfusion, solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation), especially those of the Kell or Rh system. DHTRs are often clinically silent, and when symptoms do occur they are often mild. If a DHTR is suspected, it is important to have an evaluation for RBC alloantibodies performed in the blood bank. No specific interventions are required for a DHTR in the absence of brisk hemolysis, but monitoring of the hemoglobin level (and occasionally other parameters) may be appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H354791\" class=\"local\">'Delayed hemolytic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-transfusion-reactions/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Davenport RD.
