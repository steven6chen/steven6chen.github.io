Cortisol helps the body to work normally. But when people have too much cortisol, they can get symptoms.</p><p>Cortisol is made in the adrenal glands, small organs that are located on top of each kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67279\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67279 \">figure 1</a>). Normally, the adrenal glands make cortisol after they receive signals from the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a small organ that is located just below the brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630346118\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the causes of Cushing's syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cushing's syndrome can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking steroid medicines &ndash; Steroids are medicines that act like cortisol in the body.

Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. He or she will also do lab tests to measure the cortisol levels in your urine, blood, or saliva. If your cortisol levels are high, you will need more tests to figure out which treatment is right for you. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT or MRI scans of your pituitary gland or adrenal glands, or other imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests can create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630346139\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Cushing's syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for Cushing's syndrome depends on the cause.
