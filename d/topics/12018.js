OT position describes the specific way that the presenting fetal head is rotated and is unrelated to transverse lie, in which the long axis of the fetal body is perpendicular to that of the mother. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transverse-fetal-lie\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transverse fetal lie&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4218138149\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF OCCIPUT TRANSVERSE POSITION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H864254027\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2923816082\"><span class=\"h3\">Digital examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrapartum diagnosis of OT is generally based on findings from the transvaginal digital examination. The fetal sagittal suture and fontanelles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81518 \">figure 1</a>) are palpable in the transverse diameter of the pelvis. The fetal ears can be palpated superiorly under the symphysis and inferiorly above the <span class=\"nowrap\">sacrum/coccyx</span>. If the fetal occiput (posterior fontanelle) is on the mother's left side, the position is left occiput transverse (LOT); if the occiput (posterior fontanelle) is on the mother&rsquo;s right side, the position is right occiput transverse (ROT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52247\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52247 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604304236\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While digital vaginal examination of fetal position has been the accepted standard for diagnosis, ultrasound assessment of fetal position appears to be more accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Either transabdominal, transvaginal, or transperineal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] ultrasound can be employed, though at least one group reported greater success using a transvaginal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If ultrasound is used to determine fetal position, the obstetric provider should receive specialized training for the procedure and undergo supervision by a more experienced diagnostician until <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> develops proficiency.</p><p>The key diagnostic feature for identification of OT position is the location of the fetal orbits. Both orbits are posterior when the fetus is occiput anterior (OA) and both are anterior when the fetus is occiput posterior (OP), whereas in OT position, one orbit is anterior and the other is posterior. If both orbits are on the maternal left, then the fetal position is ROT. If both orbits are on the maternal right, then the position is LOT. The fetal spine is often lateral. If a transperineal scan is performed, the cerebral midline echo is horizontal when the head in engaged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H765428360\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior or posterior asynclitism, defined as rotation of the sagittal suture away from or toward the pubic symphysis, respectively, may result in misdiagnosis of OT as either occiput anterior or occiput posterior if a lambdoidal suture is mistaken for the sagittal suture. Palpation of the fetal ears superiorly and inferiorly can help distinguish OT position from asynclitism as the fetal ears will be 90 degrees from the fontanelles. If the ears are palpated underneath the pubic symphysis and six o&rsquo;clock, then the fetus is OT; if the fetal ears are palpated at 3 o&rsquo;clock and 9 o&rsquo;clock, then the fetus is OA or OP. If the diagnosis is uncertain after careful physical assessment, ultrasound examination can be used to clarify the fetal position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3347194841\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most fetuses enter the maternal pelvis in the OT position; LOT is more common than ROT. With progressive descent during the course of labor, the occiput usually rotates anteriorly (internal rotation) but sometimes posteriorly. Only a few fetuses remain in OT position at complete cervical dilatation. Most of these fetuses will rotate to occiput anterior or posterior during maternal expulsive efforts. In a study including 563 deliveries, fetal head position at delivery was OA in approximately 95 percent, OP in approximately 5 percent, and OT in only one case (0.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Failure to rotate (malrotation) in the second stage usually results in protracted labor and often arrest of descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1914046070\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3952954813\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OT position is managed expectantly as long as labor is progressing normally. Management of persistent OT position with labor abnormalities is discussed below.

In one study that compared the fetal position late in labor with that at delivery, the rate of persistent OT position was 8.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Interestingly, the frequency was similar in patients with and without epidural analgesia, which contrasts with occiput posterior (OP) position, which was more likely to persist in patients with epidurals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent OT position is thought to result from constraint to rotation by the bony pelvis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inadequate power to induce rotation from contractions or maternal pushing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Persistent OT is more common with the platypelloid or android pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50612%7EOBGYN%2F62883\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50612 graphicRef62883 \">figure 3A-B</a>). With a platypelloid pelvis, the long occipitofrontal diameter of the fetal head readily adapts to the long transverse axis of the maternal bony pelvis, resulting in OT position, and there may not be adequate room for subsequent anterior or posterior rotation. With an android pelvis, engagement occurs in the transverse position, but rotation either anteriorly or posteriorly is impeded by the forward inclination of the sacrum.</p><p>Inadequate power can result in persistent OT because passive and active maternal expulsive forces rotate the fetus from OT or OP to the more favorable occiput anterior (OA) position.</p><p>As discussed above, epidural analgesia does not appear to be a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1914046070\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Very small OT fetuses may eventually deliver in the OT position, but all other OT fetuses must rotate anteriorly or posteriorly in order to pass through the maternal pelvic bones and deliver vaginally. Those that do not rotate and descend after at least two hours of active pushing can be divided into two subsets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High transverse arrest: arrest above station +2 (on a -5 cm to + 5 cm scale) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep transverse arrest: arrest at or below station +2 (on a -5 cm to + 5 cm scale)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88682159\"><span class=\"h3\">Treat hypocontractile uterine activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If hypocontractile uterine activity is present, contractions should be augmented with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>.

Partial or complete rotation may still occur spontaneously. If subsequent manual or forceps rotation or instrumental extraction becomes necessary, it will be easier because of the lower station <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> non-transverse position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3659319637\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to transverse arrest</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deep transverse arrest (arrest at or below station +2 on a -5 cm to + 5 cm scale)</strong> &ndash; For a woman with a deep transverse arrest, manual or forceps rotation by an experienced practitioner is reasonable, as rapid descent may occur after the rotation is accomplished. It is generally best to attempt manual rotation first because it is technically easier and less morbid. For clinicians that have been trained and have experience with forceps rotation, this is a safe and effective method to rotate the fetal vertex to OA. The clinician should be experienced in instrumental rotation, and the prerequisites for operative vaginal delivery should be met (eg, cervix is fully dilated, head is engaged, membranes are ruptured, fetal position is known, pelvis is adequate, patient consents). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Prerequisites'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a multiparous woman, if the rotation fails, a trial of vacuum extraction is reasonable; however, it is not usually attempted in nulliparous women because of the presumed higher chance of failure and concerns about increased morbidity, although little evidence exists to support either of these issues. If all such attempts fail, then a cesarean delivery is the best option. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Manual rotation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Forceps rotation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3724086789\" class=\"local\">'Vacuum extraction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High transverse arrest</strong> <strong>(arrest above station +2 on a -5 cm to + 5 cm scale)</strong> &ndash; For patients with a high transverse arrest, an attempt at manual rotation is a reasonable approach. These patients are at increased risk for cord prolapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=umbilical-cord-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Umbilical cord prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the manual rotation fails, generally, a cesarean delivery is recommended and performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Forceps rotation should only be attempted by an experienced practitioner under very unusual circumstances, such as the sudden onset of severe fetal or maternal compromise, while simultaneously initiating preparations for a cesarean delivery in the event these maneuvers are unsuccessful. Only rare clinicians have the requisite experience to safely and effectively attempt forceps rotation of a fetus in high transverse arrest.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3507075570\"><span class=\"h3\">Delivery techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Manual rotation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manual rotation is performed by grasping the fetal head with the operator's hand, placing the tips of the index and middle fingers along the lambdoid sutures, flexing and slightly dislodging the vertex, and then rotating the head between contractions via rotation of the operator's hand and forearm. Ideally, rotation is to the OA position. Alternatively, the operator's thumb and fingers can be placed on the parietal bones to grasp the head, which is then rotated. The head may need to be held in place for a few contractions to prevent rotation back toward the transverse position. Maternal pushing efforts during such contractions can facilitate descent of the now-rotated fetal head and improve the changes of persistent OA position.</p><p>The effectiveness of manual rotation was illustrated in a retrospective cohort study that found patients who underwent a trial of manual rotation in the second stage of labor (n = 731) had significantly shorter second stage and a significantly higher rate of vaginal delivery than those who did not have a trial of manual rotation (n = 2527), although intervention was associated with an increased risk of cervical laceration (2.2 versus 1.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Because of this risk, we prefer expectant management as long as labor is progressing. If manual rotation is planned, it should be attempted soon after diagnosis of arrest of descent because it is more likely to be successful before the head becomes significantly impacted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is also more likely to be successful in parous than nulliparous women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Forceps rotation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional forceps (eg, Simpson or Tucker-McLane) can be used for rotation, but the pelvic curve of such forceps is a disadvantage. The Kielland forceps were specifically designed without a pelvic curve to improve performance of rotational procedures. The toes, blades, shanks, and handle lie along the long axis so the toes travel along a smaller circle during rotation than conventional forceps. However, in the rare case of a platypelloid pelvis, some providers believe that Kielland forceps are contraindicated. Technical considerations regarding application, rotation, and traction with forceps are complex and beyond the scope of this topic review. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3724086789\"><span class=\"h4\">Vacuum extraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent OT position occurs infrequently, and the performance of even easy forceps deliveries in the United States is diminishing; thus many clinicians lack the training, experience, and sound clinical judgment that come with experience to perform a 90-degree forceps rotation. In the United States, vacuum extraction is performed fourfold more often than forceps delivery for operative deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Although rotational force or torque should never be applied when pulling on the vacuum extractor, the <span class=\"nowrap\">downward/outward</span> force on the fetal vertex may lead to an auto-rotation of the fetal vertex from OT to OA position during vacuum extraction. Proper cup placement is essential, and selection of an appropriate cup design for the clinical situation is important. A rigid vacuum cup is advantageous over a soft cup because it allows greater traction, which is often needed for rotation from OT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A flexible stem permits placement and movement of the device within the limited space of the vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Anterior auto-rotation is most likely to occur when cup application and traction result in head flexion rather than deflexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/occiput-transverse-position/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The vacuum extractor itself should not be manipulated to rotate the head.

It results from either constraint to rotation to occiput anterior or occiput posterior by the bony pelvis or inadequate power. Arrest of descent is the major consequence.
