However, anthrax remains a concern in the developed world because of its potential as an agent of bioterrorism. Anthrax meningitis and the fulminant phase of inhalation anthrax are associated with extremely high mortality rates.</p><p>The treatment of anthrax will be reviewed here.

Systemic anthrax is defined as cutaneous anthrax with systemic involvement; gastrointestinal, injection, or inhalation anthrax; anthrax meningitis; or bacteremia.

Empiric treatment for anthrax cases in which anthrax meningitis is suspected or cannot be ruled out should include intravenous therapy with at least three antimicrobial agents with activity against <em>B. anthracis</em>, including at least two agents with bactericidal activity, and at least one protein synthesis inhibitor (to reduce exotoxin production), and all agents should have good central nervous system (CNS) penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anthrax/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Drainage of both pleural fluid and ascites is thought to improve survival by reducing the toxin level and by decreasing mechanical lung compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anthrax/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. Pleural fluid should be drained early and aggressively; chest tubes are preferred over thoracentesis because many effusions require prolonged drainage. Thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery might be required to remove gelatinous or loculated pleural effusions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568457007\"><span class=\"h3\">Other invasive procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ascites should be drained; drainage of ascites is done preferably with continuous drainage, although in resource-limited situations repeated drainage is acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anthrax/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Hemodynamically significant pericardial effusions should also be drained. Surgery should not be performed for cutaneous anthrax since it can lead to dissemination and poor outcomes. Tracheostomy may be required for patients with airway obstruction and surgery may be required for large or circumferential extremity lesions causing compartment syndrome. Surgery may be indicated for patients with gastrointestinal anthrax to address potentially fatal complications, including bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation. For injection anthrax, surgery may be performed to obtain diagnostic specimens and to differentiate the infection from necrotizing fasciitis and to remove the necrotic nidus of infection, which may serve as a reservoir for toxin and spores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1128366218\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because inhalation anthrax can have a prodromal phase followed by a fulminant phase characterized by sudden decompensation, hospitalized patients should have careful hemodynamic monitoring, including continuous pulse oximetry and telemetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anthrax/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Standard sepsis care should be administered to patients with systemic anthrax, including intravenous fluids, vasopressors, blood products, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring as needed.</p><p>Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage occur frequently with anthrax infection; these complications should be managed aggressively and may be contraindications to central venous catheter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anthrax/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with anthrax may require mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress, airway protection (for those with altered mental status), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> airway edema. Substantial airway edema can occur with cutaneous lesions involving the head, neck, or thorax, and with oropharyngeal lesions.</p><p>More detailed recommendations for supportive care can be found in the <a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/2/13-0687_article&amp;token=l4XEPiERdo6YCULKBVgx+p/qCaRAoOA2L+XbG1ARz3ADOYwsl64P3xDKIXOyu1Vq+42svhzbdNZfp+8ajPDasA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=15309\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC guidelines</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1203606\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anthrax pre-event vaccination and postexposure vaccination, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raxibacumab-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raxibacumab</a> prophylaxis are reviewed separately.

However, anthrax remains a concern in the developed world because of its potential as an agent of bioterrorism. Anthrax meningitis and the fulminant phase of inhalation anthrax are associated with extremely high mortality rates. Anthrax is a reportable disease and immediate notification should be made to the local or state health department and public health laboratory even if there is only clinical or laboratory suspicion of anthrax or exposure to <em>Bacillus anthracis</em>. (See <a href=\"#H193168587\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H185609414\" class=\"local\">'Public health reporting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningitis and hemorrhagic brain infection has been observed in up to one-half of systemic anthrax cases. Unless it is contraindicated, all patients suspected of having inhalation anthrax should undergo lumbar puncture to evaluate for meningitis. Other important caveats are discussed above.

When selecting an antimicrobial regimen, the production of toxin, the potential for antimicrobial drug resistance, the frequent occurrence of meningitis, and the presence of latent spores must be taken into account.
