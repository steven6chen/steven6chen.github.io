They can form when something rubs or presses on the skin over time.</p><p>Corns usually affect the bottoms of the feet and sides of the toes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83520\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83520 \">picture 1</a>). A corn looks like a small bump, and has a hard center surrounded by an area of irritated skin. Corns are often painful.</p><p>Calluses often form on the hands, fingers, feet, or toes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83519\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83519 \">picture 2</a>). They look like thick, rough, sometimes bumpy skin. Calluses usually do not hurt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876933365\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes corns and calluses?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corns and calluses can result from:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing shoes that are too tight or too loose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing shoes without socks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking around barefoot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using tools (like a hammer or rake) or sports equipment (like a tennis racket) that can rub against the skin</p><p/><p>If you have other problems with your feet, you might be more likely to get corns or calluses. For example, if you have a bunion (a bony bump at the base of your big toe), your shoes can rub against it. This can cause a corn or callus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876933380\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for corns and calluses?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse can tell if you have a corn or callus by looking at your skin. If your doctor or nurse thinks that your corns or calluses are caused by problems with the bones in your feet, you might need an X-ray.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876933395\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to get rid of corns and calluses?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help corns and calluses heal, and prevent new ones, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear shoes and socks that fit properly. Tight shoes or shoes with high heels can cause corns and calluses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid going barefoot, or wearing shoes without socks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use special pads inside your shoes to prevent rubbing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876933410\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If you think you have a corn or a callus and it is causing pain, see a doctor or nurse. He or she can check to see if you have a corn, callus, or something else (like a wart), and whether it needs treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876933425\"><span class=\"h1\">How are corns and calluses treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a corn or callus that causes pain or won't heal on its own, your doctor can treat it. Treatment usually involves removing the top layers of skin on the corn or callus, and then applying a patch that has medicine in it. The patch will soften the skin, so that more can be removed. After it has been in place for 2 to 3 days, the doctor can trim the skin again and replace the patch. This process can be repeated until the trouble spot is gone.</p><p>If you would like to treat yourself, you can buy the patches with medicine in them without a prescription (sample brand names: Curad Mediplast, Dr. Scholl's Callus Removers). Then your doctor can teach you how and when to change the patch yourself. But you should <strong>not</strong> use this treatment if you have diabetes or other conditions that can affect the nerves in the feet.</p><p>If your corns or calluses are severe or keep coming back, your doctor might refer you to a foot doctor, called a &quot;podiatrist.&quot; A podiatrist can fit you with a special shoe insert (called an &quot;orthotic&quot;) to help protect and cushion your feet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876933440\"><span class=\"h1\">Can corns and calluses be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. You are less likely to get corns or calluses if you avoid shoes that squeeze or rub against your feet or toes. You can also wear gloves to protect your hands when using tools that might rub on your skin (such as while gardening).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876933455\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bunion-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bunion (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-warts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Skin warts (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
