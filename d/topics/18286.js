In addition, many elderly, depressed patients have contraindications to antidepressant medications, do not tolerate or respond to medications, cannot participate in psychotherapy or do not respond to it, or may develop severe symptoms and complications of depression that require immediate relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-indications-for-and-efficacy-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>].

As an example, a prospective observational study enrolled 240 patients (mean age 70 years) with unipolar major depression and treated them with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> (target dose 225 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> plus right unilateral, ultrabrief pulse ECT three times per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-indications-for-and-efficacy-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Remission occurred in 62 percent of patients; the mean number of ECT treatments in patients who remitted was 7.3 and the mean time to remission was thus about 2.5 weeks. In addition, global cognitive functioning at baseline and post-ECT was comparable. Other studies have found that remission occurs in up to approximately 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-indications-for-and-efficacy-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect/abstract/14,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,63</a>].

As an example, a study of bilateral ECT three times per week for unipolar major depression compared response in three age groups: younger (age 18 to 45 years, n = 79), middle-aged (age 46 to 64, n = 81), and elderly (age 65 to 85, n = 93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-indications-for-and-efficacy-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The analyses found that remission occurred in more middle-aged or elderly patients compared with younger patients (86 and 80 versus 57 percent). In addition, greater age (as a continuous variable) was associated with lower depression rating scale scores.</p><p>Maintenance ECT can also be beneficial for older patients. A systematic review identified two randomized trials (single blind) that compared ECT with pharmacotherapy as maintenance treatment in patients aged 60 years and older who had remitted from an episode of psychotic depression after acute ECT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-indications-for-and-efficacy-of-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].
