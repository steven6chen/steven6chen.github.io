The term &quot;rhinosinusitis&quot; is preferred to &quot;sinusitis&quot; since inflammation of the sinuses rarely occurs without concurrent inflammation of the nasal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The most common etiology of ARS is a viral infection.

Intranasal glucocorticoids are likely to be most beneficial for patients with underlying allergic rhinitis.

A higher dose of intranasal glucocorticoids had a stronger effect on symptom improvement. When used as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy in the treatment of ABRS, a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials suggests that 15 patients would need to be treated with intranasal glucocorticoids to improve clinical symptoms in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17851666\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral decongestants</strong> &ndash; Oral decongestants may be useful when eustachian tube dysfunction is a factor for patients with AVRS.

We start antibiotic therapy after diagnosis for patients who do not have good follow-up. The symptomatic management of ABRS is similar to that of acute viral rhinosinusitis (AVRS).

The guidelines suggest that factors such as age, general state of health, and comorbidities should be considered when choosing this option. These guidelines differ from the 2012 IDSA guidelines in that the IDSA guidelines prefer initiation of antibiotics for those with persistent symptoms or signs compatible with acute rhinosinusitis lasting for &ge;10 days without any evidence of clinical improvement <strong>or</strong> onset with severe symptoms or signs of high fever (&ge;39&deg;C [102&deg;F]) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least three to four consecutive days at the beginning of the illness <strong>or</strong> worsening symptoms or signs for three to four days characterized by the new onset of fever, headache, or increase in nasal discharge following a typical viral upper respiratory infection that lasted five to six days and were initially improving (&quot;double sickening&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. We prefer to provide an option for continued observation in patients with uncomplicated ABRS as many patients with ABRS improve without antibiotic therapy.</p><p>ABRS may be a self-limited disease, and patients may improve without antibiotic therapy. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found that many patients with ABRS improve without antibiotic therapy within two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For example, a 2014 systematic review of randomized trials in immunocompetent patients with maxillary sinusitis found that 80 percent of patients not treated with antibiotics improved within two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Another 2012 systematic review of randomized trials involving immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis found that almost 50 percent of patients improved by one week, and 70 percent by two weeks, irrespective of antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

However, the rates of spontaneous recovery for patients with ABRS are likely to be lower than reported in these analyses, as trials generally diagnose ABRS by clinical criteria and are likely to include some patients with AVRS.

Another found that, compared with placebo, antibiotic therapy with penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> decreased clinical failure at 7 to 15 days (lack of full recovery or improvement; risk ratio [RR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.94), but the clinical benefit was small and adverse events were more common with antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncomplicated-acute-sinusitis-and-rhinosinusitis-in-adults-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>However, the studies in these meta-analyses have limitations.
