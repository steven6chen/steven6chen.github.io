Knowledge of lymph node status is important for prognosis and to determine the appropriateness of adjuvant systemic therapy.</p><p>The identification of patients with subclinical nodal metastases has undergone significant evolution over the past two decades. For patients for whom there is a reasonable risk of regional lymph node metastasis (melanomas &gt;1 mm in thickness and certain thinner melanomas, especially those with ulceration or &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mitosis/mm<sup>2</sup>),</span> lymphatic mapping with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has become the standard staging approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If melanoma metastasis is present in the SLN biopsy, completion lymphadenectomy is usually recommended and adjuvant therapy considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma&quot;, section on 'Sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>The pathologic evaluation of regional lymph nodes is discussed in this topic. The role of SLN biopsy and the management of patients with a positive SLN biopsy are discussed separately, as is the pathology of the primary lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathologic characteristics of melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000631\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specimen preparation with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining remains the gold standard for histologic interpretation of nodal material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77565\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77565 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>However, both serial sectioning and immunohistochemical staining for melanoma-associated tumor markers (eg, the highly sensitive S100 and the highly specific melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 [MART-1]) facilitate the detection of metastatic melanoma cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64086\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64086 \">picture 2</a>). In one retrospective study of 235 histologically negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) from 94 patients with cutaneous melanoma, deeper serial sections and immunohistochemical stains detected microscopic metastases in approximately 12 percent of cases that would otherwise have been reported as negative for metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Protocols for pathologic evaluation of SLNs vary among different hospitals. The practice at the Massachusetts General Hospital for handling formalin-fixed SLNs is to bisect the lymph node through its hilum and section the entire node into slices that are 1 to 2 mm thick (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77332\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77332 \">figure 1</a>). Nine tissue sections are then sampled from each node in groups of three, with each group separated by a distance of approximately 100 microns. The first, fourth, and seventh levels are immunostained for MART-1; the second, fifth, and eighth levels are stained with H&amp;E; the third, sixth, and ninth levels are immunostained for S100. With the 2017 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for cutaneous melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], the detection of a single melanoma cell by either H&amp;E or immunohistochemical staining is sufficient to classify the lymph node as positive for metastasis. While some advocate for less exhaustive pathologic workup of melanoma SLNs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], others emphasize the importance of thin sectioning and immunohistochemical analysis in optimizing detection of metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000638\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A normal lymph node contains innumerable lymphocytes admixed with histiocytes. Although benign capsular nevi may occasionally be present, the detection of intranodal deposits of melanocytic cells usually indicates metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Nevic rests are nests of benign melanocytes that typically reside within the nodal fibrous capsule and nodal trabeculae but are occasionally found in the subcapsular area of lymph nodes. These nevic rests have no malignant potential but are often mistaken for melanoma cells because they stain similarly to melanoma cells. They are &quot;nevic&quot; because they form nests in the lymph nodes and resemble either benign dermal nevus cells, Spitz nevus cells, or blue nevus cells. Intriguingly, a recent study has raised the possibility that detection of the <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation in capsular nevi of a sentinel lymph node (SLN) may be correlated with negative prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Benign pigment-laden histiocytes, which are normally scattered throughout the node, can resemble melanoma cells, further adding to the difficulty in identifying a single malignant melanoma cell within a lymph node. These challenges to the accurate and precise identification of melanoma metastasis to the SLN are further exaggerated on frozen section analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathologic characteristics of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Growth phases of melanoma'</a>.)</p><p>The subcapsular region is an important area for microscopic examination. Benign nevic cell rests are sometimes located in subcapsular areas and can be difficult to distinguish from metastatic melanoma cells. The lymphatic drainage, and therefore metastatic cells, enter the node at the level of the subcapsular sinus, and the majority of nodal metastases involve the subcapsular area. In one study of 281 SLN biopsies, 86 percent of nodal metastases involved at least the subcapsular region (32 percent were purely restricted to this region), while 11 percent were purely restricted to the parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The prognostic significance of the location of nodal metastases is unclear. However, the location of the metastasis within an SLN may predict the likelihood of involvement of other lymph nodes. In a report of 146 patients with melanoma and at least one positive SLN, those with isolated subcapsular micrometastases had a significantly lower rate of non-SLN nodal metastases than those with a different microanatomic location pattern (0 of 38 [0 percent] compared with 24 of 108 [22 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In part based upon these data, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Melanoma Group recommends explicit documentation in the pathology report of the microanatomic location of the metastasis, the SLN tumor burden according to the Rotterdam Criteria for the maximum diameter of the largest metastasis expressed as an absolute number, and the SLN tumor burden stratified per category (&lt;0.1, 0.1 to 1.0, or &gt;1.0 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Assessment of the size and extracapsular extension of melanoma in SLNs may provide useful prognostic information. In a study of 1539 SLN-positive melanoma patients, the subcapsular micrometastases &lt;0.1 mm in maximum diameter had the least non-SLN metastases. On the other hand, tumor dimension of &gt;1 mm had the highest rate of non-SLN positivity and diminished disease-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A similar relationship was observed in an earlier study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Extrapolating from the prognostic import of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of primary melanoma, the significance of the lymphocytic milieu associated with metastatic melanoma deposits within an SLN is also being investigated. Positive correlations between recurrence-free <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> overall survival and the number of CD3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, the number of CD4+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and the number of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There was a negative correlation with the number of peritumoral programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1)+ lymphocytes, but not with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Higher survival rates may be related to lymph node PD-1 expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000645\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of nodal metastases by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining alone can lead to overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of metastatic disease, due to hypercellularity of the lymph node and similar staining of melanoma cells with normal lymph node constituent cells. Immunohistochemical staining in conjunction with H&amp;E analysis is used to improve sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Several antigens have been identified on melanoma cells that are used for diagnostic immunohistochemistry. Because no one single antigen has yet been isolated with 100 percent sensitivity and 100 percent specificity to serve as the ideal &quot;melanoma marker,&quot; combinations of immunohistochemical stains are typically employed to balance sensitivity and specificity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000652\"><span class=\"h2\">S100</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>S100 (100 percent soluble in ammonium sulfate at neutral pH), a calcium-binding protein, is a sensitive marker of melanocyte differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The monoclonal antibody directed against S100 was derived from human melanoma cells, and it targets a 10-kDa cytoplasmic glycoprotein portion of the transmembrane complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although highly sensitive, the monoclonal antibody targeting S100 is not specific for melanoma cells, as it stains a variety of other cell types, including benign nevic cells, macrophages, Langerhans cells, adipocytes, chondrocytes, myoepithelial cells, sweat gland cells, and neural-crest-derived cells (eg, Schwann cells, glial cells). Within the lymph node, S100-positive-staining nevic rests and dendritic cells complicate the assessment for melanoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000659\"><span class=\"h2\">MART-1 and Melan-A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1) and Melan-A antibodies target the product of the <span class=\"nowrap\">MART-1/Melan-A</span> complex, which is a small protein that is expressed in melanomas as well as normal adult melanocytes; it was initially identified as the target for cytotoxic T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Antibodies against Melan-A are immunoreactive against both benign and malignant melanocytic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Anti-Melan-A also reacts with the perivascular smooth muscle cells of lymphangiomyomatosis, the so-called clear cell &quot;sugar&quot; tumor of the lung (a rare, benign perivascular epithelioid cell tumor), renal angiomyolipoma, adrenocortical tumors, as well as sex-cord stromal tumors of the ovary. Because melanomas of spindle cell morphology do not stain with HMB45 (human melanoma black), immunoreactivity with anti-Melan-A is particularly helpful in diagnosing these lesions. While MART-1 positivity within the lymph node is valuable for its high specificity, it should be noted that occasional histiocytes presenting melanocyte antigens may also react to MART-1 antibodies. Although MART-1 expression is not specific for malignant transformation, its expression by micrometastasis in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) has been correlated with poorer survival in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000666\"><span class=\"h2\">HMB45</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antibody HMB45 reacts with a 10-kDa cytoplasmic glycoprotein that is part of the glycoprotein 100 (gp1000) premelanosome complex. In addition to reacting with most melanomas, it is immunoreactive with fetal and neonatal melanocytes, intraepidermal and superficial dermal components of benign nevi, blue nevi, and deep-penetrating nevi. Although HMB45 does not differentiate between benign and malignant melanocytic lesions, staining with HMB45 provides strong evidence of melanocytic histogenesis. In addition, diffuse staining of the deeper dermal components of borderline melanocytic neoplasms is suggestive of melanoma. However, the lack of reactivity with spindle cell melanomas limits its usefulness as an immunohistochemical marker for melanoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1000673\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitf</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microphthalmia transcription factor (Mitf) is another melanoma marker that can be applied to immunohistochemical analysis.

Although Mitf expression is present in both benign and malignant melanocytic lesions, anti-Mitf immunostaining is often positive in melanomas that fail to react with HMB45 or anti-S100 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathologic-evaluation-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].
