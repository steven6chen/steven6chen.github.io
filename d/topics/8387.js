Hydralazine is an arterial vasodilator, and nitrates are predominantly venodilators. These vasodilatory effects can reduce left ventricular afterload and intracardiac filling pressures, and thereby may decrease pathologic cardiac remodeling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac remodeling: Basic aspects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has also been hypothesized that the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> with nitrates enhances nitric oxide bioavailability since nitrates serve as nitric oxide donors and hydralazine is an antioxidant that reduces consumption of nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydralazine-plus-nitrate-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. It has been postulated that this protective mechanism can be recruited even in the presence of neurohormonal blockade (eg, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">USE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28549389\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3237885086\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For select patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> plus oral nitrate as a component of therapy. Our recommendations are similar to major society guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F91786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91786 \">figure 1</a>) and are based on the clinical trial evidence discussed below.

Beta blocker, ACE inhibitor (or ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy should be at target or maximally tolerated doses. Volume depletion should be avoided since this may increase susceptibility to hypotension with hydralazine plus nitrate therapy.

These studies are also indicated if the patient develops symptoms such as arthralgia, fever, chest pain, or persistent malaise. The United States Food and Drug Administration labeling also recommends following the complete blood count, but blood dyscrasias from hydralazine therapy are rare and patients with HFrEF often have other indications to check blood counts, such as chronic anemia.

Adherence to this therapy has been poor (estimated as 7 percent of eligible patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydralazine-plus-nitrate-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]), which is likely caused by the inconvenient dosing (large number of tablets and frequency of administration) and the high rate of adverse reactions. </p><p>Treatment can be initiated with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing 37.5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> hydrochloride and 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosorbide-dinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosorbide dinitrate</a> taken three times daily. As an alternative, starting doses of hydralazine tablet 25 mg three times daily and isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg three times daily are recommended. Although we consider a combination of generic hydralazine hydrochloride tablet plus isosorbide dinitrate tablet a reasonable substitute for the fixed-dose combination tablet, some experts believe that generic combinations are not equivalent to the fixed-dose combination tablet. The fixed-dose combination tablet, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosorbide-dinitrate-and-hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosorbide dinitrate-hydralazine</a>, is more expensive but more convenient than dosing the two drugs individually. Eligibility for dose titration should be evaluated every two to four weeks until the target dose is achieved. The target dose is hydralazine 75 mg three times daily and isosorbide dinitrate (40 mg three times daily). The dose should not be increased if symptomatic hypotension develops. Although direct evidence of efficacy is lacking, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosorbide-mononitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosorbide mononitrate</a> (40 to 120 mg daily) may be used in place of isosorbide dinitrate to improve compliance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Slow titration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> and nitrate dose is recommended to enhance tolerance and reduce common adverse effects such as headache, dizziness, and hypotension. In the A-HeFT trial, headache occurred in 48 percent of patients taking this drug combination (significantly greater than 19 percent in the placebo group) and dizziness occurred in 29 percent (versus 12 percent in the placebo group). If symptomatic hypotension occurs, reduction in hydralazine plus nitrate therapy is recommended but concurrent HF therapy (such as beta blocker, ACE inhibitor or ARB, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy) should be continued, if possible. </p><p>Other adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> plus nitrate therapy are nausea and vomiting, sinus congestion, and tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydralazine-plus-nitrate-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].
