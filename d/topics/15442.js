There is a 10-fold variation in bladder cancer incidence among different countries, with the highest rates in Europe, North America, Western Asia, and Northern Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the United States, there are approximately 80,000 new cases per year and 17,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The natural history of bladder cancer is highly variable and depends on the stage of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110763 \">table 1</a>). The majority of bladder cancers (65 percent) are diagnosed at an early stage and are low-grade non-muscle-invasive tumors with a very low risk of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, high-grade non-muscle-invasive disease has a 50 to 70 percent risk of recurrence and a 10 to 30 percent risk of progressing to muscle-invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Diagnosis at a later stage can be associated with high-grade muscle-invasive disease that can progress quickly, metastasize, and become fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bladder cancer classification, cell types, and specifics about pathology are described in detail separately.

Other contributors to risk include demographic factors (eg, male gender, older age, white) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], medical treatments (eg, pelvic irradiation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, chronic indwelling urinary catheter), and <span class=\"nowrap\">heredity/family</span> history of bladder cancer. A personal history of bladder cancer is also a risk factor due to the high recurrence rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Risk estimation for bladder cancer is not a precise science; it involves rough approximations. Estimates may be made by assessing the degree of exposure to factors known to increase risk for bladder cancer. Generally, bladder cancer risk is heightened among people with greater duration and extent of direct exposure to cigarette smoke or to industrial chemicals. For example, people in high-risk occupations include aluminum workers, people who work directly with vats of chemical carcinogens such as aromatic amines, or those who are exposed to diesel exhaust [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Specific chemicals that pose increased risk, as well as additional risk factors for bladder cancer, are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Several attempts have been made to develop models to define a &ldquo;high-risk population&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There are models that use known sociodemographic and clinical risk factors; however, these models have generally been used for research and are seldom used in clinical practice. Such models have typically included age, sex, and other factors (eg, family history, smoking history, race, occupational exposure). In two studies, such models were able to identify a group of study participants who were more likely to develop bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In another study, cigarette smoking served as the strongest risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One study&rsquo;s findings suggested that screening high-risk patients would be significantly more cost-effective and feasible than screening the general population; however, the study used comparisons with historical controls, and thus the conclusions cannot be considered definitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE NOT TO SCREEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although screening for bladder cancer might appear to have the potential to be beneficial based upon an understanding of known risk factors and the availability of urine tests that are easy to administer, studies do not show sufficient benefit of screening for bladder cancer. There are no randomized trials, available observational studies do not present convincing evidence even for a high-risk population, and urine analysis testing lacks specificity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4069506240\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence of the efficacy of screening for bladder cancer is lacking. There are no randomized trials or case-control studies that assess outcomes in screened versus unscreened populations. Most evidence on bladder cancer is from observational studies, and they show mixed results, with some studies suggesting that screening may be beneficial in high-risk populations. However, observational studies are of limited usefulness because they are subject to multiple confounders as well as to lead-time bias and length-time bias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evidence-based-approach-to-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evidence-based approach to prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one observational study, screening for bladder cancer was associated with a low bladder cancer mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this study, hematuria was detected in 16 percent of 1575 men aged &ge;50 years who were tested repeatedly during one year, and bladder cancer was identified on cystoscopy in 8 percent of those men (21 men, 1.3 percent of the tested cohort). Of those bladder cancers, 11 were low-grade, 9 were high-grade, and 1 was invasive. Two men with hematuria who had initial negative cystoscopy later developed bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. After 14 years of follow-up, bladder cancer mortality among the 21 men with screening&ndash;detected bladder cancer was lower than the mortality rate among men identified via a bladder cancer registry (0 versus 20 percent). However, although mortality due to bladder cancer was lower, overall mortality was not significantly lower in the screening-detected group than in the registry-identified group (relative risk 0.80, 95% CI 0.48-1.32).</p><p>By contrast, other observational studies have not suggested that early detection of bladder cancer has such a benefit on mortality due to bladder cancer. Progression of disease despite detection at the non-muscle invasive stage was illustrated in a study involving 2356 asymptomatic men aged &ge;60 years screened weekly for 10 weeks using dipstick testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Of the 20 percent (474 men) who had hematuria, 317 underwent further evaluation that identified asymptomatic bladder cancer in 0.7 percent of the screened population (17 men). Of these 17 men with bladder cancer, 10 had positive urine cytology and none had muscle-invasive disease at diagnosis. After at least 7 years of follow-up, eight men with well-differentiated superficial tumors at diagnosis had no progression to muscle-invasive disease; however, among the nine men with prognostically less favorable cancers at diagnosis, six had died (three due to bladder cancer, three due to unrelated causes) and two had developed muscle-invasive disease (including one of those who died of unrelated causes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">High-risk screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies do not show that active screening of even a high-risk population confers a strong survival benefit or alters the natural history of the disease in those who do develop bladder cancer. Various non-randomized observational, retrospective, and cohort studies have shown that, among high-risk workers occupationally exposed to known carcinogens, urine screening tests can find bladder cancer at a relatively early stage. Other studies have shown the yield of screening urine tests to be lower than expected among high-risk groups. Interpretation of studies about screening these high-risk populations is difficult because of problems in assessing the extent of toxin exposure, changes in screening methods over time, and the absence of randomized trials.</p><p>Urine cytology, biomarkers, and cystoscopy have been used to screen workers at very high risk for developing bladder cancer due to occupational exposure to known urothelial carcinogens.</p><p>In one observational study, screening a very high-risk population did suggest a trend toward improved five-year survival; however, the data did not reach statistical significance and the study had limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In this study beginning in 1970, very high-risk aluminum production workers exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coal-tar-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">coal tar</a> derivatives were followed for 16 years, during which 79 cases and 19 deaths from bladder cancer were found. Beginning in 1980, the workers were screened annually with urine cytology. Those diagnosed via urine cytology screening had a non-significantly higher percentage of noninvasive disease compared with those diagnosed prior to the initiation of screening (77 versus 67 percent). Although there was a trend toward increased five-year survival after screening (relative risk [RR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.20-1.48), there was no adjustment for confounders and the use of historical controls raised the possibility that factors other than screening could account for any observed differences.</p><p>Another cohort study showed that certain urinary biomarkers could be used to stratify workers into risk groups, but that study could not address whether early identification of bladder cancer had a survival benefit. In the study, workers occupationally exposed to benzidine and non-exposed workers were tested for six years with urinary biomarkers (DNA ploidy, bladder tumor-associated antigen p300, and G-actin) to identify risk groups for bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Initial urine screening was performed with biomarkers and cytology for 1788 exposed and 373 non-exposed workers, and the results were used to stratify workers to determine screening schedules; those at high risk (two positive markers or extremely high titers of one marker, hematuria, or positive cytology) were screened every six months with cystoscopy, urine cytology, and biomarkers; moderate-risk workers (one positive biomarker) were screened annually with biomarkers only; and those at low risk (all initial tests negative) were not rescreened for over three years.</p><p>Compared with workers negative for both markers, the risk of developing bladder cancer was 81 times higher (95% CI 33.3-199.3) among workers positive for the two markers found to be useful for risk stratification (DNA ploidy and p300) and 20 times higher (95% CI 8.0-47.9) for workers positive for only one of those two markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Two observational studies showed a low detection of bladder cancer even when screening a very high-risk population. In a 15-year study of 408 workers with probable past industrial exposure to a beta-naphthylamine, a carcinogen associated with 20- to 30-fold excess mortality due to bladder cancer, 350 people were screened with dipstick urinalysis, cytology, and newer biomarkers (as those became available) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Bladder cancer was diagnosed in 1 percent of the screened cohort (a total of three people: one carcinoma in situ, two transitional cell papillomas) and eventually another 2 of the 14 workers initially diagnosed with dysplasia developed urothelial cancer. In another study, 1322 men previously exposed to aromatic amines were screened annually for seven years with urine dipstick and microscopy, cytology, NMP22, and UroVysion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Bladder cancer was detected in 14 patients, 9 of whom had high-grade tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1012108969\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of potential screening tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ideal screening test for a general population should be relatively inexpensive and easy to administer, with high sensitivity and reasonable specificity. Specificity is particularly important when the disease prevalence is low, as in bladder cancer.</p><p>Potential tests to screen for bladder cancer include urine testing for microscopic hematuria, cytology, and biomarkers (tumor-specific molecular markers) that are shed into the urine. Urine testing is noninvasive and easy to administer; however, there are few data to compare the accuracy of urine tests for screening for bladder cancer in a general population. Some testing modalities known to be effective for diagnosing bladder cancer in the presence of signs or symptoms (eg, radiologic and cystoscopic testing) are not warranted for screening due to the associated potential for harm, the expense, and the low prevalence of disease in the asymptomatic population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1487201987\"><span class=\"h3\">Microhematuria testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microscopic hematuria has a low predictive value for bladder cancer.</p><p>Although microhematuria is present in most patients with bladder cancer, even in the early stages of disease, microscopic hematuria is also associated with a number of causes that are far more prevalent than bladder cancer, and urologic cancers account for only approximately 2 to 3 percent of cases of microscopic hematuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F61296\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61296 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The prevalence of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria identified by dipstick testing or urinalysis in the general population is variable (eg, ranging from 2 to 31 percent of the United States population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]), and microscopic hematuria may be intermittent even in patients with bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Microscopic hematuria'</a>.)</p><p>Prospective observational studies reaffirm that hematuria lacks specificity for bladder cancer even when using dipstick testing for a population at somewhat higher risk for bladder cancer (healthy older men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. For example, even among men at high risk due to exposure to aromatic amines, the positive predictive value of microscopic hematuria was only 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Although the presence of microscopic hematuria in the general population has a low predictive value for urothelial carcinoma, prompt urologic evaluation is recommended by American Urologic Association (AUA) guidelines for all patients 35 years or older in whom benign causes of microhematuria have been ruled out, and in patients of any age at the discretion of the treating clinician, particularly when there is a high suspicion for malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Even though dipstick testing is inexpensive, widely available, and can be self-administered, if a dipstick test is done and is positive, it must be confirmed with microscopy because of the higher false-positive rate of dipstick testing for blood compared with microscopic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Among 1984 men age 50 to 75 years, hematuria was detected in 409, of whom 75 (18 percent) had positive biomarker tests (NMP22, microsatellite analysis, fibroblast growth factor receptor-3, and DNA methylation analysis).

A theoretical benefit of virtual MRI cystoscopy over gold-standard cystoscopy is its minimally invasive nature, as well as its ability to evaluate the ureteral orifices and urethra from all angles, its evaluation of diverticula, and its lack of radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-bladder-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

However, potential harms include false-positive test results that can lead to anxiety and to subsequent diagnostic procedures that carry risks. Typically, follow-up tests would include upper tract imaging with radiation risk and cystoscopy with or without biopsy, with associated risks of perforation, bleeding, and infection. Given the low positive predictive value of positive urine screening tests for hematuria or biomarkers (&lt;10 percent), the burden of additional diagnostic testing to evaluate what would frequently turn out to be false-positive findings would affect a significant number of screened individuals. In contrast to screening for certain other cancers, overdiagnosis of bladder cancer is unlikely to occur, because bladder cancer is rarely an incidental finding at autopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3348887748\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4083312236\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, we do <strong>not</strong> screen for bladder cancer in the general population due to the absence of data showing efficacy, the lack of tests with adequate specificity, and the potential harms of follow-up testing done to evaluate abnormalities detected on initial urine testing. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Rationale not to screen'</a> above.)</p><p>If there is any benefit to screening, it would most likely be among high-risk patients who have a higher incidence of bladder cancer (eg, those with a known risk factor such as a prolonged smoking history or high-risk occupational exposure) (see <a href=\"#H2175294737\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above). However, the available data do not show that screening confers a survival benefit even for this population. Because of this lack of supportive evidence, some UpToDate contributors do not screen for bladder cancer, even in high-risk patients. However, other UpToDate contributors do offer bladder cancer screening with annual urinalysis to high-risk patients (and, in some patients at very high risk, urine cytology as well) because of the simple collection process, the low risk of the actual test, and the overall limited body of evidence. Given the inadequate data, an individualized approach to the decision to screen high-risk patients is appropriate, with the choice based on the patient's values and preferences. If a screening test is done and the findings are abnormal, further workup is warranted to determine whether the patient has bladder cancer or another disease that needs treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Recommendations from expert groups are somewhat mixed with regard to screening high-risk patients; all acknowledge the lack of evidence to support a survival benefit of screening. All also agree that screening is not warranted for those without high-risk exposure. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations of expert groups'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the impact of education and screening on survival has not been well-established, education might facilitate early intervention for high-risk patients. Patients at high risk should be educated about risk factors and early symptoms of bladder cancer, especially gross hematuria. Education should also emphasize risk reduction including smoking cessation and minimizing occupational exposure. All individuals, and especially those with occupational exposures known to increase risk, should be strongly counseled not to smoke, and smokers should be offered smoking cessation treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations of expert groups'</a> below.)</p><p>Those with known high-risk occupational exposure also should use appropriate work safety precautions. These include personal protective equipment that minimizes carcinogen exposure, strict hygiene measures, and increased stringency of workplace safety regulations.</p><p>The effects of healthy diet, good fluid intake, and the potential for chemoprevention (not suggested outside of a clinical trial) are discussed separately.

Once urothelial carcinoma is muscle-invasive, it can quickly progress and metastasize, leading to death. Non-muscle-invasive, low-grade tumors constitute approximately 65 percent of all new cases of urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder and have low risk of progression. High-grade non-muscle-invasive disease has a 50 to 70 percent risk of recurrence and 10 to 30 percent risk of progression to muscle-invasive disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no randomized trials to evaluate the effectiveness of screening for bladder cancer in preventing cancer mortality or limiting morbidity from treatment of early disease. Prospective studies confirm a low positive predictive value for screening in older men at average risk. Studies of screening in populations of industrial workers at high risk for bladder cancer confirm that screening can identify noninvasive bladder cancer, but it is not known whether screening has an impact on disease outcome. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Rationale not to screen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests considered to screen for bladder cancer include urine dipstick for red blood cells, microscopic analysis for red blood cells, urine cytology, and urine biomarkers. The relatively low prevalence of bladder cancer in an average-risk screening population requires greater specificity for bladder cancer than these tests provide. (See <a href=\"#H1012108969\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of potential screening tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopic hematuria identified on urinalysis is present in most patients with bladder cancer, even in the early stages of disease. However, microscopic hematuria is associated with a number of causes that are far more prevalent than bladder cancer in the general population. Overall urologic cancers account for only approximately 2 to 3 percent of cases of microscopic hematuria. (See <a href=\"#H1487201987\" class=\"local\">'Microhematuria testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors associated with increased risk for developing bladder cancer include exposure to chemical carcinogens (eg, tobacco, occupational and environmental exposures), older age, and male sex. (See <a href=\"#H2175294737\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not screen for bladder cancer in the general population because of the absence of data showing efficacy, the lack of tests with enough specificity, and the potential harms of follow-up testing for abnormalities detected on initial urine testing. (See <a href=\"#H4083312236\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available data do not show that screening confers a survival benefit, even for a high-risk population.
