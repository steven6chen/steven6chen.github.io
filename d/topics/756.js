Amniotic fluid is the liquid that surrounds the fetus inside the mother's uterus (womb) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469314452\"><span class=\"h1\">Why is amniocentesis done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniocentesis is done to get a sample of amniotic fluid. The amniotic fluid is tested to get more information about the health of the fetus.</p><p>The 2 most common reasons amniotic fluid is tested are to find out if the fetus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a genetic problem, such as Down syndrome. This might be done if another test, such as an ultrasound or blood test on the mother, has shown that the fetus might have a genetic problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will be able to breathe on its own if it is born before the due date</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469314459\"><span class=\"h1\">When is amniocentesis done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The test can be done any time after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The timing depends on why the amniotic fluid is being tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469314466\"><span class=\"h1\">How is amniocentesis done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Here are the main steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A doctor will do an ultrasound so he or she can see moving pictures of your uterus, your fetus, and the amniotic fluid on a screen (like a TV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This doctor or another doctor will watch the screen as he or she inserts a needle into your belly and then into the amniotic fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53857 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The doctor will use the needle and a syringe to take out a small amount of fluid. The test usually takes about 1 to 2 tablespoons of fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fluid will be sent to a lab for tests.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469314473\"><span class=\"h1\">Does amniocentesis have any risks?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Problems are rare, but they can happen. Risks include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaking of amniotic fluid &mdash; This might or might not stop by itself. If it doesn't stop, it can cause problems for the baby, such as infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &mdash; Infection can lead to miscarriage early in pregnancy, or preterm labor and preterm birth later in pregnancy. (Preterm birth means the baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The needle can touch the baby, which in rare cases causes an injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood from the placenta can leak into your own bloodstream. (The placenta is the organ that brings the baby nutrients and oxygen and carries away waste.) This can cause problems for later pregnancies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469314480\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I be worried about symptoms after the procedure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what symptoms you have and how bad they are. After amniocentesis, it is normal to have mild cramps in your belly for a short time.</p><p>Call your doctor if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are bleeding or leaking fluid from your vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have cramps that are getting worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&ordm;C)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469314487\"><span class=\"h1\">What if the test shows that my fetus has a genetic problem?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can talk to your doctor and a genetic counselor before and after the test. They can help you understand the genetic problem and your feelings, and help you decide what to do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469314592\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chorionic villus sampling (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniocentesis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Amniocentesis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chorionic villus sampling (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
