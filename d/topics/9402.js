Management of food allergy consists of strict avoidance of the food allergen and treatment of accidental exposures with medications. Allergies to certain foods, such as egg and milk, tend to be outgrown during childhood, whereas allergies to other foods, such as shellfish and nuts, are much more likely to persist. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is one of several allergen-specific approaches under investigation for the treatment of food allergy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Novel therapeutic approaches to food allergy can be classified as food allergen specific (eg, immunotherapy with native or modified recombinant allergens, or oral desensitization) or food allergen nonspecific (eg, anti-immunoglobulin E [IgE], traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80640\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80640 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The goal of these therapies is to induce permanent tolerance to the food, where the allergy will not recur upon re-exposure after a period of abstinence. However, some therapies in development appear to only temporarily desensitize or protect patients, requiring continued treatment to maintain efficacy. Before these new approaches are applied in clinical practice, they must be carefully evaluated for side effects, such as acute adverse reactions and toxicity.</p><p>OIT for food allergy is reviewed in this topic. Other food allergen-specific therapies as well as nonspecific therapies are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-immunotherapy-and-nonspecific-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational therapies for food allergy: Immunotherapy and nonspecific therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3867382441\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OIT to food is generating increasing interest as a potential approach to the treatment of food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. A high rate of desensitization has been demonstrated in both randomized trials and observational studies of OIT. Fewer treated patients become tolerant, but the rate of acquisition of tolerance is higher than that seen in patients who completely avoid the allergen. Additional long-term follow-up data are needed to help determine which patients will gain the most from OIT and in which patients the risks outweigh the benefits.</p><p>The 2014 Updated Food Allergy Practice Parameter advised against performing OIT in routine clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The 2017 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EEACI) Task Force on Allergen Immunotherapy and the 2016 guidelines from the Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology recommended conducting oral immunotherapy in medical facilities with expertise in allergen immunotherapy and management of anaphylactic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The Japanese guidelines additionally stated that OIT should not be recommended as standard treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2700883942\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale and mechanisms of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for using the oral route is that ingestion of a food antigen preferentially results in an active immune system response but one that does not trigger an allergic reaction towards that antigen (ie, oral tolerance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Oral tolerance is thought to be mediated by induction of regulatory T cells with low-dose antigen exposure or lymphocyte anergy or deletion with high antigen doses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;, section on 'Factors influencing sensitization or tolerance'</a>.)</p><p>The humoral immunologic changes include a gradual increase in serum levels of specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin A2 (IgA2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In addition, an initial increase in serum levels of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies is seen in the first 12 months, followed by a subsequent decrease. Specific T regulatory cells increase and peak at approximately 12 months, with a subsequent decrease. Increased antigen-induced regulatory T cell function is associated with hypomethylation of forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Basophil reactivity, skin prick test responses, and serum levels of T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines decrease gradually, whereas interferon (IFN) gamma, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1 alpha, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) 1 increase over the course of OIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/1-3,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1838577622\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal is to induce permanent tolerance to the food, such that there can be periods of abstinence that do not lead to a recurrence of clinical reactivity upon reintroduction of the food. An important goal for patients and their families is reduction of anxiety related to food allergies and improvement in quality of life. This may be accomplished even if the patient does not develop tolerance. There is no standard definition of the oral tolerance achieved with OIT. The surrogate term used by many clinical trials is that of sustained unresponsiveness (SU). The outcomes of OIT are usually defined as desensitization and SU. Desensitization to a regular serving size of the food is tested with an oral food challenge (OFC) while continuing maintenance dosing. SU is tested with an OFC to the food following discontinuation of OIT for a period of time, varying from 2 to 24 weeks, usually 4 to 8 weeks.</p><p>Some patients may not be fully desensitized in that they cannot tolerate ingestion of a normal serving size of the allergenic food. These patients nevertheless benefit from an increase in the threshold dose of food required to cause an allergic reaction as they have some protection from accidental exposures. This increased threshold often also improves quality of life. Partial reintroduction of the food may have some nutritional value as well. These patients do need to continue to ingest the food on a daily basis to guarantee maintenance of the desensitization state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2557653124\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are generally started on a very small daily dose of the food (eg, 3 to 6 mg of food protein) and advanced periodically (usually every two weeks) to a maintenance dose (eg, 300 mg or, depending on the food and goals, 1 to 2 g of food protein daily) over several months. The initial dose and dose increases are given under clinical supervision, whereas the remainder of the daily doses during the dose advancement phase and maintenance therapy are administered at home. The food included in OIT is usually otherwise strictly avoided in the diet during the duration of OIT. The frequency of dosing required to maintain desensitization is not known. Results from one small trial suggest that twice-a-week dosing is sufficient for maintenance of milk desensitization, although these patients were allowed to consume dairy products other than milk <em>ad libitum</em> in addition to the daily or twice-weekly dose of milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For patients who have demonstrated SU to the food (tolerate ingestion of the full challenge dose after avoiding the food for four to eight weeks after discontinuation of therapy), the author advises continued regular intake of the food in the diet (at least once every one to two weeks) indefinitely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H232594799\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of OIT-treated patients (up to 75 percent of those enrolled in studies) become desensitized (see <a href=\"#H1503083217\" class=\"local\">'Single foods'</a> below). Desensitization is defined as a state of temporary food allergen hyporesponsiveness and an increased threshold for reactions compared with the pre-OIT threshold. Desensitization provides protection from anaphylaxis to unintentional ingestion of small amounts of food allergen and is dependent upon a regular (daily) intake of the OIT dose. The desensitized state can be lost when OIT dosing is interrupted by illness or nonadherence. In contrast, only a minority of children treated with OIT achieve SU that is independent of regular food intake and is maintained even if the food is eliminated from the diet for long periods of time. SU is associated with lower pretreatment levels of food-specific IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, the rate of SU can be increased with longer duration of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Much longer-term data are needed to determine what percent of patients develop permanent tolerance.</p><p>Limited long-term follow-up data suggest that desensitization may not be maintained in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In one long-term follow-up study of 32 children who had successfully completed milk OIT in one of two randomized trials, only six patients (19 percent) had unlimited intake of milk and dairy products. However, among the six patients with unlimited intake, three (50 percent) reported variable symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Of the other patients, some had significant symptoms, including reactions severe enough to prompt treatment with epinephrine. Reactions were associated with exercise, illness, and missing several days of cow's milk ingestion in 13, 9, and 6 percent, respectively.</p><p>It is unclear what time period of food allergen elimination defines permanent tolerance to that food. Thus, the term &quot;sustained unresponsiveness&quot; is used as a surrogate for permanent tolerance when reporting results of clinical trials. Most large clinical trials incorporate a period of food elimination ranging from a few weeks to several months following completion of OIT to evaluate for SU. In one long-term follow-up study, for example, half of the 40 treated subjects demonstrated SU by year 4, indicating that a longer duration of OIT enhances SU and increases the likelihood of tolerating unbaked egg in the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23</a>]. Increased serum-specific egg white IgG4, IgA, and IgA2 during egg OIT were associated with clinical response to egg OIT. Lower pretreatment serum levels of egg white and ovomucoid-specific IgE were also associated with SU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], with similar findings reported for peanut OIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Results from one trial suggest that SU is more likely when OIT is initiated at a younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2965534928\" class=\"local\">'Peanut'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3784519023\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic reactions to OIT are common, particularly during the build-up phase of dosing, and occur at higher rates in patients on OIT than those avoiding the food. Although they are usually mild, allergic symptoms can lead to withdrawal from a study. However, many who have allergic side effects still continue OIT. Oral and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common, followed by lower respiratory symptoms (eg, wheeze). Anaphylaxis is uncommon, but many small trials report at least one case. Cases of newly diagnosed eosinophilic esophagitis after undergoing OIT have also been reported.</p><p>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of milk OIT, the risk of an adverse reaction was 34-fold higher (95% CI 4.8-244.7) in children receiving OIT compared with an elimination diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In one study of 20 children undergoing peanut OIT, the risk of mild wheezing was 18 percent during the initial escalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The probability of having any symptoms after a build-up dosing phase was 46 percent (29 and 24 percent for upper respiratory tract and skin symptoms, respectively). The risk of reaction with any home dose was 3.5 percent, and treatment was given for 0.7 percent of home doses. Similar results have been reported for milk and egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/17,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,31</a>]. Approximately 6 to 16 percent of subjects on peanut OIT withdraw from the study due to allergic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/30,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32,33</a>]. In one unblinded trial, 16 percent of subjects on OIT did not tolerate daily ingestion of the target maintenance dose of peanut protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Nine subjects (36 percent) in another randomized trial were not able to tolerate milk OIT due to flares of atopic dermatitis or recurrent acute adverse effects (eg, urticaria, abdominal pain, emesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, quality-of-life scores in the patients, as perceived by the caregivers, improved after OIT despite frequent mild side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective review of peanut OIT administered at five different sites, reactions treated with epinephrine occurred at a rate of 0.7 per 1000 escalation doses and 0.2 per 1000 maintenance doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of milk OIT, rates of systemic reactions and use of epinephrine were higher with OIT than avoidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A second review found that 1 in every 11 patients on milk OIT was treated with epinephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. There is one case report of life-threatening anaphylaxis in a patient during the dose-escalation phase of milk OIT when dose escalation was continued despite a serious reaction that occurred earlier on the same day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Systemic reactions may occur at previously tolerated doses in the setting of exercise or viral illness, particularly if accompanied by a fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/31,34,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34,38,39</a>]. Other risk factors for an allergic reaction to a previously tolerated dose of food are dosing on an empty stomach, dosing during menses, and having suboptimally controlled asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis after OIT has been reported in 3 to 8 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. Pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> does not appear to decrease this risk. Three cases of eosinophilic esophagitis were reported from a clinic that had performed milk OIT in 110 patients over a five-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A prospective study of 128 children who underwent milk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> egg OIT between 2006 and 2014 documented eight cases of eosinophilic esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Eight percent of the subjects who underwent peanut OIT (two treated with omalizumab and one treated with placebo) developed symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis (biopsy confirmed in two cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Symptoms resolved with discontinuation of peanut OIT in all three subjects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1973638325\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimizing risk of systemic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To minimize the risk of systemic reactions related to OIT dosing, it is recommended that OIT doses are administered at the same time of the day, following a meal or large snack, and physical activity is restricted for one to two hours after dosing. In addition, dosing is suspended during active illness. Dosing is either resumed at the same dose, at home or under supervision in the office, or the dose is reduced and gradually escalated to pre-illness level, depending upon the number of missed doses. However, reactions may occur during a prodromal phase of an infection before any symptoms of an illness become apparent. Dosing is either resumed at the same dose, at home or under supervision in the office, or the dose is reduced and gradually escalated to pre-illness level, depending upon the number of missed doses. Each patient treated with OIT is also prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector, instructed in its use, and given a detailed emergency anaphylaxis treatment plan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1624116226\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of limitations and unanswered questions with regard to OIT. The concept of oral immunomodulation and tolerance induction for therapy of food allergy is attractive, and preliminary data on food OIT and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) suggest a beneficial treatment effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. It appears that nonreactivity to food (desensitization) is achieved and maintained in a large subset of patients, as long as the food is ingested regularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/21,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,45</a>]. However, allergic symptoms recur in many patients who reach the maintenance dose if the food is not ingested on a regular basis (SU), highlighting a concern of whether OIT is capable of inducing permanent oral tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients and families appreciate that much of the treatment is administered at home. However, significant adverse reactions to OIT are common and can occur even on maintenance dosing. The full maintenance dose cannot be achieved in some patients, due to allergic symptoms. In addition, a small percentage of patients develop eosinophilic esophagitis on OIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Furthermore, it is difficult to discern the actual effects of oral desensitization versus the natural resolution of food allergies that are typically outgrown, such as cow's milk and egg allergies. Thus, food OIT remains limited to the research setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Further research with larger, multicenter, randomized trials is necessary to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of food OIT. (See <a href=\"#H232594799\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3784519023\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Four meta-analyses on immunotherapy for milk, egg, and peanut allergy have pointed out significant limitations of the published studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/29,36,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36,48-50</a>]. All concurred that there are insufficient data to recommend OIT as routine treatment for food allergy. Two of these meta-analyses included all randomized-controlled, quasi-randomized-controlled, and case-controlled trials of peanut and milk OIT published from 1990 through January 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/36,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,48</a>]. Among 746 papers addressing peanut OIT, only one study fulfilled the inclusion criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Based upon the findings of this one small trial, peanut OIT cannot be recommended as routine treatment for patients with peanut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Less rigorous criteria were used in the meta-analysis of milk OIT studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Sixteen publications, representing five trials that included a total of 196 children, were reviewed. The quality of these trials was low, and no standardized protocols were used. Thus, they concluded that guidelines and further studies are necessary prior to incorporating desensitization into clinical practice. None of the studies included in the meta-analyses provided evidence that OIT can induce permanent &quot;tolerance,&quot; and none of the trials followed subjects for more than two years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2780372307\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies of OIT have involved treatment with only a single food. However, many children have multiple food allergies. Thus, researchers are beginning to explore OIT with multiple food allergens. Additional approaches include OIT with modified food allergens and OIT combined with anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-IgE) or adjuvant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1503083217\"><span class=\"h2\">Single foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OIT protocols have been reported for cow's milk, hen's egg, peanut, fish, apple, orange, and celery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/7,8,30,34,45,51-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,30,34,45,51-58</a>]. Milk, egg, and peanut are the most extensively studied and are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1183242502\"><span class=\"h3\">Cow's milk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials evaluating the effectiveness of milk OIT published through May 2011 found that the likelihood of developing full tolerance to cow's milk was 10-fold higher (95% CI 4.1-24.2) and partial tolerance fivefold higher (95% CI 1.2-24.5) in 218 children treated with milk OIT compared with a milk elimination diet in four randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Results were similar for full milk tolerance in another systematic review and meta-analysis that included 196 patients from five randomized trials published through October 2012 (relative risk [RR] 6.6, 95% CI 3.5-12.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and were consistent with results from observational studies. The authors of both meta-analyses felt that the quality of the evidence was low and therefore the effect of OIT uncertain. In addition, the rate of permanent tolerance appears to be lower than the rate of desensitization. Thus, further randomized trials are needed.

However, a much smaller percentage of patients have SU after discontinuing OIT.

Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 26) or peanut OIT (n = 29) with a defatted, lightly roasted peanut flour tested for uniformity in potency of the major peanut allergens (updosed from 0.5 mg to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> top dose equivalent to approximately one peanut, over 20 to 34 weeks, with a minimum of two weeks on the top dose before the exit DBPCFC). Twenty-three (79 percent) of the peanut OIT subjects completed OIT and passed a DBPCFC (&ge;443 mg cumulative dose of peanut protein) with no dose-limiting symptoms, whereas only five (19 percent) in the placebo group passed the exit DBPCFC. The remaining six subjects (21 percent) in the peanut OIT group withdrew due to adverse events, primarily gastrointestinal symptoms. A greater decrease was seen in the maximal skin prick test wheal diameter and a greater increase in peanut-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) from screening to study exit in the peanut OIT group compared with placebo, but no significant difference was seen in the change in peanut-specific IgE.</p><p>Another randomized trial examined the safety and efficacy of early peanut OIT in 40 children aged 9 to 36&nbsp;months with suspected or known peanut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Enrollment criteria included reacting to peanut during an entry food challenge. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive OIT at target maintenance doses of 300 or <span class=\"nowrap\">3000&nbsp;mg/day</span> (no placebo group). The primary endpoint, SU four&nbsp;weeks after stopping OIT (4-SU), was assessed by DBPCFC either upon achieving four prespecified criteria or after three years of maintenance therapy. Outcomes were compared with 154 matched standard-care (avoidance) controls. Three of 40 consented subjects (7.5 percent) did not qualify. Overall, 29 of 37 (78 percent) children achieved 4-SU (17 of 20 [85 percent] in the 300 mg arm and 12 of 17 [71 percent] in the 3000 mg arm) over a median of 29&nbsp;months. Peanut-specific IgE levels decreased significantly in the children treated with OIT compared with matched standard-care controls, in whom peanut-specific IgE levels significantly increased. Allergic side effects during OIT were common, but all reactions were mild to moderate. The results of this study suggest that peanut OIT initiated in infants and toddlers is well tolerated and has higher efficacy regarding SU compared with initiating peanut OIT in older children based upon results from other studies. In addition, low-dose peanut OIT (300 mg peanut protein daily) was as efficacious as high-dose maintenance (3000 mg peanut protein daily) in this age group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2883886265\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aeroallergen-specific immunotherapy frequently combines multiple allergens, and this multiallergen approach is under investigation for foods. A phase-I safety study of a multifood OIT was conducted in parallel with peanut OIT in subjects with peanut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Forty subjects reacted at the baseline DBPCFC to a maximum cumulative dose of 182 mg of peanut protein; of those, 25 had additional food allergies (eg, walnut, cashew, pecan, almond, hazelnut, cow's milk, egg, and sesame) confirmed by DBPCFC. Fifteen patients received peanut OIT only. OIT was done with two foods in six participants, three foods in eight, four foods in five, and five foods in six. The protocol had three phases: the initial dose escalation day, home dosing with biweekly up-dosing, and the maintenance phase. The daily maintenance dose was 4000 mg protein of each allergen, with up to 20,000 mg as a cumulative dose for five-food OIT. Rates of reaction per OIT dose were 3.3 percent in multifood OIT and 3.7 percent in the single OIT group. Most reactions were mild, but two severe reactions requiring epinephrine occurred in each group during home maintenance dosing. This study did not include challenges while on maintenance therapy to confirm desensitization, nor did it include evaluation of SU. These preliminary results suggest that multifood OIT is an option for patients with multiple food allergies, but these findings need validation by large and rigorous randomized trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3875560561\"><span class=\"h2\">Modified allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 60 to 80 percent of individuals with cow's milk or hen's egg allergy can tolerate extensively heated or baked forms of these foods. In addition, including extensively heated milk or egg in the diet may accelerate the development of tolerance. Humoral and cellular immunologic changes seen in children with a history of milk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> egg allergy who passed OFCs to milk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> egg in baked goods parallel the changes reported in OIT trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>]. This approach, allowing ingestion of extensively heated forms if tolerated, might be conceived as similar to OIT in that the exposure may have an immunotherapeutic effect that could lead to higher thresholds of the foods in forms that are not extensively heated. However, for the 20 to 40 percent who are unable to ingest the baked forms, there are insufficient studies addressing the use of extensively heated <span class=\"nowrap\">milk/egg</span> for escalating doses in desensitization regimens. OIT with extensively heated milk or egg is under investigation, so far with limited success.

Only three patients (21 percent) achieved the full daily dose of baked milk (1.3 g baked milk protein) after 12 months of OIT. Eight patients developed frequent, immediate systemic reactions to baked milk OIT. The results of this study confirm prior observations from baked milk trials that patients with a more severe phenotype of milk allergy are likely to react to baked milk. In contrast, 8 of 15 children with IgE-mediated egg allergy (aged 6 to 17 years) in another study responded favorably to gradual home-based introduction of baked egg and tolerated an open OFC to one whole hard-boiled egg after 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

All patients given HydE tolerated the full dose at day 1 and received the maintenance dose from the start at home.

Safety and feasibility studies of milk, egg, and peanut OIT, as well as multifood OIT, combined with anti-IgE have been reported. Most of the preliminary data on treatment with omalizumab prior to OIT are encouraging. Larger clinical trials underway will help clarify which patients would benefit most from this approach.</p><p>In two small, pilot studies for milk OIT and one for peanut, patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> pretreatment prior to OIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. These high-risk patients were able to tolerate much higher doses of allergen in much shorter periods of time compared with patients in prior studies of OIT without omalizumab. Nearly all patients tolerated rush desensitization to milk or peanut on the first day of dosing, although one patient required treatment with epinephrine for a reaction. Almost all of the patients (90 to 100 percent) also reached the maximum maintenance dose targeted and were considered desensitized. In two of the studies, all patients who were continued on daily maintenance therapy passed oral challenges 8 to 12 weeks after discontinuation of omalizumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].

While there were no significant differences in the percent of patients demonstrating desensitization or SU in this trial, safety was improved, particularly during the escalation phase of OIT. Adverse reactions were reduced during OIT escalation in omalizumab-treated subjects compared with placebo regarding median percentages of doses per subject provoking symptoms (2 versus 16 percent), dose-related reactions requiring treatment (0 versus 4 percent), and doses required to achieve maintenance (198 versus 225). Dose-related symptoms were less common during maintenance therapy but were also reduced in the omalizumab-treated group (median percentages of doses provoking symptoms during maintenance therapy 0 versus 3 percent).

In a pilot study, 25 children who had failed an initial DBPCFC at a protein dose of 100 mg or less for each included food were pretreated with omalizumab for 16 weeks and then treated with rush OIT for multiple foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Nineteen participants (76 percent) tolerated all six steps of the initial escalation day (up to 1250 mg of combined food proteins), requiring minimal or no rescue therapy. The remaining six patients were started on the highest tolerated rush doses as their initial daily home doses. The maintenance dose of 4000 mg protein per allergen was reached by all patients at a median of 18 weeks. Participants reported 401 reactions per 7530 home doses (5.3 percent) with a median of 3.2 reactions per 100 doses. Ninety-four percent of reactions were mild. There was one severe reaction.</p><p>In a subsequent phase-II trial, 48 children aged 4 to 15 years with multiple food allergies (two to five foods, confirmed by failed DBPCFC at a dose of &le;500 mg of food protein) were randomly assigned 3:1 to pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> or placebo for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Both groups were then treated with multifood OIT from weeks 8 to 36, and omalizumab or placebo was continued for 16 weeks total. A greater percent of patients treated with both omalizumab and OIT demonstrated desensitization (passed 2 g of protein DBPCFCs) to at least two of their offending foods compared with those treated with OIT alone (83 versus 33 percent, odds ratio [OR] 10.0, 95% CI 1.8-58.3).

Desensitization and SU after two weeks of avoidance were achieved in 90 (26 of 29) and 82 (23 of 28) percent receiving PPOIT and 7 (2 of 28) and 4 (1 of 28) percent receiving placebo, respectively. PPOIT also induced immune changes that suggest modulation of the peanut-specific immune response.</p><p>In a follow-up study four years after cessation of treatment and completion of the randomized trial, 67 percent of patients (16 of 24) in the treatment group had continued eating peanut compared with 4 percent (1 of 24, absolute difference 63 percent) in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

However, if one considers all enrolled in the initial trial treatment group, only 23 percent (7 of 31) achieved SU, not 58 percent, a rate similar to that seen in previously reported studies of OIT without probiotic adjuvant. In addition, there was no difference in the numbers of serious reactions between the two groups during this follow-up period (11 reactions in four patients in the PPOIT group compared with 9 reactions in six patients in the placebo group). Furthermore, there were several other significant flaws in study design (absence of blinding, no preceding DBPCFC to confirm peanut allergy prior to the start of the trial, and lack of proper controls [peanut OIT alone, probiotic alone]) that limit the conclusions that can be drawn from these results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-food-allergy-oral-immunotherapy/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3031057935\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Oral and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common, followed by lower respiratory symptoms (eg, wheeze). Anaphylaxis is uncommon but occurs more frequently in patients on OIT than in patients who avoid the food. Systemic reactions may occur at previously tolerated doses, particularly in the setting of exercise or viral illness. Some patients have been diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis after undergoing OIT.
