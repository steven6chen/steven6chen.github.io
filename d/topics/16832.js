In the vast majority of situations, tattooing provides accurate localization of lesions for later identification. However, in some cases localization is inaccurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss methods to localize colonic lesions, with a focus on endoscopic tattooing. Other issues related to colonoscopy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colonoscopy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR LESION LOCALIZATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Localization prior to surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions in the colon that require surgical excision may sometimes be palpable or easily recognized during surgery. However, small lesions and those that have been previously removed colonoscopically can be difficult to localize even if the same endoscopist performs the subsequent examination. Even large lesions may not be palpable by the surgeon if they are soft and compressible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This problem is particularly important for patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted surgical colonic resection as the laparoscopist cannot palpate the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, it is important to have a marker that can be readily and reliably seen laparoscopically. It is not sufficient for the endoscopist to state that &quot;a lesion is in the transverse colon&quot; since more specific localization is needed to avoid conversion to an open surgery to find the lesion or resection of an incorrect or unnecessarily large portion of the colon.</p><p>In a study of 101 patients who underwent right hemicolectomy, lesion localization by preoperative colonoscopy combined with computed tomography (CT) scan was inaccurate for 29 percent of lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As a result, the authors recommended that tattooing of all suspicious lesions at colonoscopy should be standard practice to prevent inadequate resection and lymphadenectomy, particularly for patients with small lesions or for patients likely to have laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>It is our practice to inject a permanent marker during the initial colonoscopy if a lesion cannot be removed or if an endoscopically removed polyp has clinical features that may require surgical resection or follow-up colonoscopy (eg, to ensure complete removal or to monitor for recurrence). If a marker injection was not performed and the histology report is unfavorable, tattooing can still be accomplished within the next several weeks to ensure that the site is still visible. Beyond this time point it may be difficult to be sure the tattoo is placed at the correct location because the site may have healed and may appear normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Documentation of marker placement and direct communication with the surgeon (when possible) are important to ensure accurate lesion identification at the time of surgery. The surgeon should be told whether the marker was placed proximal or distal to the lesion (many surgeons prefer that all markers be placed distal to the lesion). It is also important that the surgeon be aware if lesions at multiple sites were tattooed to ensure that the correct lesions are removed.</p><p>Although most commonly employed in the colon, preoperative marking has also been used in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract. As an example, a Dieulafoy's lesion in the fundus of the stomach was successfully localized by a preoperative injection of India ink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Preoperative marking is also used for lesions in the small bowel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-deep-small-bowel-enteroscopy#H388475164\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of deep small bowel enteroscopy&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic applications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Localization for follow-up colonoscopic procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precise localization is also important when there is a need to relocate a lesion or an area of the colon at a future point in time. As an example, it may be desirable to know the site at which a polyp was removed in piecemeal fashion so that the area can be readily identified at the follow-up colonoscopy to ensure that the entire polyp was removed. This is especially important if the polyp was on the backside of a fold or around a bend of the colon. Following endoscopic removal of a high-grade polyp or a malignant adenoma, the site may heal completely in eight weeks, and a locator mark may assist the surgeon or the endoscopist in identifying the place where the lesion had been.</p><p>As in surgical marking above, it is necessary for the endoscopist to note where the injection was made in relation to the lesion (ie, proximal or distal) since a small scar or a tiny residual adenoma may be difficult to find during the follow-up colonoscopy if the marker location relative to the lesion was not documented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS TO LOCALIZE LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of methods are used for localizing lesions in the colon. Tattooing is by far the most consistently reliable and most widely used method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Location of the instrument tip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Localization by measuring the number of centimeters an instrument is introduced into the colon is a relatively poor method for tip localization, particularly in patients who have undergone previous colorectal procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The actual number of centimeters inserted may have no relationship with the actual tip location within the colon unless both the colon and the colonoscope are relatively straight. Loops may significantly affect the amount of endoscope inserted and may cause the endoscopist to overestimate the distance from the anal verge, whereas a straight endoscope, without any loops, can give a more accurate estimation of the distance from the anal verge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Landmarks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Landmarks are helpful but imprecise for localization of areas between the rectum and cecum. Even the most experienced endoscopists may err in their estimates of tip location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/3,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,12</a>].</p><p>Lesions can only be reliably localized using landmarks when they are within 15 cm of the anus, near the cecum, or near the ileocecal valve. In these settings, there is no doubt as to the lesion's location and the surgeon can easily identify both areas. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2190185377\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic clips</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One or more endoscopic clips can be placed through the colonoscope onto the mucosa at any location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. They can assist in radiographic or ultrasonographic location of the marked segment. A report of eight patients with pre-laparoscopic clip placement by colonoscopy found that intraoperative ultrasound readily located the marked areas for surgical resection, although in practice, radiographic means are most commonly used to identify metal endoscopic clips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoclip therapy in the gastrointestinal tract: Bleeding lesions and beyond&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A problem with clips is that the amount of time they remain attached to the mucosa is highly variable, ranging from days to months after placement (average of approximately 10 days), and the endoscopist has no real control of when they fall off of the target lesion. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This problem can be compounded if the clip detaches just prior to surgery and migrates from its original site. Other problems are that the clips are small and may not be easily palpable during laparotomy and cannot be seen at laparoscopy, although a mobile C-arm fluoroscope is available in most operating rooms and can be used to assist in clip localization. The risk of clip migration may be reduced by placing more than one clip at a target location, which increases the chance for at least one clip remaining in place. Over-the-scope clips are often permanent devices, although they are technically more difficult to place. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoclip-therapy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract-bleeding-lesions-and-beyond#H91474252\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoclip therapy in the gastrointestinal tract: Bleeding lesions and beyond&quot;, section on 'Uses for over-the-scope endoclips'</a>.)</p><p>Clips placed preoperatively can be located by intraoperative colonoscopy, by fluoroscopy, or by laparoscopic ultrasonography. Laparoscopic ultrasonography is the most rapid method for identifying the clips (seven minutes on average), but may be limited by intestinal gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Barium enema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Barium</a> enemas are still an acceptable method for determining the location of polyps or cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, small lesions and those that have been removed endoscopically may not be easily visualized. In the latter case, only a small puckering may be present, or the site may be almost completely healed within three to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluoroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluoroscopy or a radiograph of the abdomen during endoscopy may assist in locating the site of a lesion. Unfortunately, with the instrument in a straightened configuration, it may be difficult to accurately locate the tip of the colonoscope. For example, it may appear that the tip of the colonoscope is in the distal descending colon when it is actually in the mid-portion of a long redundant sigmoid loop. Intraoperative fluoroscopy has been used to locate clips placed on colorectal cancers by preoperative colonoscopy, requiring approximately 15 minutes to find the clips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2190185377\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic clips'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative colonoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is possible to localize the site of a tumor or a polypectomy site by performing intraoperative colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/2,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18,19</a>]. With the rise of endoscopic training in surgical residency programs, some surgeons will perform the colonoscopy. Alternatively, surgeons can call on more experienced endoscopists to assist them in the operating room.</p><p>Another problem with intraoperative colonoscopy is that the large volume of insufflated air can create problems with surgical techniques once the endoscopist has completed the necessary localization. Furthermore, because the site of a polypectomy may heal within a few weeks, there is a possibility that a polypectomy site may not be visible to the endoscopist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Tattooing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ideal method for lesion localization is to have an easily identifiable marker that will immediately draw the attention of the surgeon or endoscopist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This can be achieved with injection of dye solutions. Tattooing is used primarily for localization of a lesion prior to surgery or to allow for localization of a lesion during follow-up colonoscopy.</p><p>Multiple dyes are available for tattooing. One study demonstrated that, of eight different dyes injected into the colon wall in experimental animals, only two persisted for more than 24 hours: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> and India ink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other dyes, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>, toluidine blue, isosulfan blue, hematoxylin, and eosin, were absorbed within 24 hours, leaving no residual stain at the injection site.</p><p>A commercial suspension of carbon particles (SPOT) is available. It has the advantage, unlike India ink, of being sterilized and prediluted, and is used in many centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Indocyanine green</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indocyanine green</a> is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use. It is considered to be relatively nontoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], but has been reported to cause inflammation at injection sites in a rabbit model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It provides excellent staining of the serosal surface and draining lymphatics for up to eight days following its injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Clinical experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> tattooing in 12 patients demonstrated that the dye was easily visualized on the serosal surface of the colon at surgery within 36 hours following injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The problem with a marker that has such a relatively short duration is that the decision to operate after removal of a malignant polyp may require a few weeks, with slide reviews and multiple consultations, at which time the site may no longer be visible. Indocyanine green is currently in limited use clinically. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">India ink</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experience with tattooing has been with India ink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/6,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24-26</a>]. The stain persists for at least 10 years with no diminution in intensity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78733\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78733 \">picture 1</a>). In one report of 63 patients, the marking was visible at laparoscopy in 98 percent and allowed for identification of the tumor in 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>A permanent marker may have an advantage in several settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As mentioned above, a lesion requiring surgery may be injected and surgery may be postponed for several weeks, at which time a vital dye such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> will have been absorbed, leaving the operating surgeon with no visible evidence of its having been injected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69334\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69334 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be desirable to mark the site of a resected polyp for subsequent endoscopic localization when it is anticipated that the area will be difficult to find on a follow-up examination, especially when the lesion is located around a fold or behind a haustral septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A stain with a permanent marker such as India ink will draw immediate attention to the site, permitting a more accurate and complete assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77062\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77062 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While tattooing was traditionally done with India ink, SPOT, a commercially available suspension of sterilized, prediluted carbon particles, overcomes the problems with using India ink: namely, the need to sterilize and dilute the solution prior to use. Other sterilized India ink preparations are also commercially available; however, unlike SPOT, they have not been approved by the FDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Prophylactic antibiotics do not appear to be necessary before injecting India ink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], although it has been suggested that prophylactic antibiotics should be given before injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>India ink is black drawing ink made with carbon particles. If India ink is to be used as a permanent marker, it must be sterilized prior to use. This can be accomplished by treating a diluted solution in an autoclave. As an alternative, the ink can be rendered bacteriologically sterile by passing the diluted solution through a 0.22 micron Millipore filter, which is interposed between the syringe containing the dilute solution of India ink and the injection needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. To prevent clogging, it is helpful to use two filters in tandem: the first (0.44 micron) filters large particles while the second (0.22 micron) filters bacteria.</p><p>Injection can be accomplished with a standard endoscopic needle catheter of sufficient length to traverse the accessory channel of a 168 cm colonoscope. Most standard injection needles work well with the endoscope in any configuration. Injection catheters can be plastic, metal, or incorporated into a polypectomy snare. </p><p>The needle should ideally enter the mucosa at an angle to permit injections into the submucosa rather than to have the needle pierce the bowel wall. Prior raising of a saline bleb in the submucosa with subsequent injection of the surgical marker into that bleb will prevent deep injection of the marker through the colon wall. When possible, the edges of intrahaustral folds should be targeted.</p><p>If a submucosal bleb is not immediately seen during an injection, the needle should be pulled back slightly since the needle tip may have penetrated the full thickness of the wall and the carbon suspension may be injected into the peritoneal cavity. While an intracavity injection is not a clinical problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23</a>], it can scatter black carbon particles around the abdominal cavity, which may be somewhat disconcerting for the surgeon. As the needle is pulled back slowly, dye should continue to be injected to identify the correct plane of injection. When the needle is in the submucosal plane, a bleb will develop.</p><p>Since the colonoscopist cannot know which portion of the bowel is the superior aspect, multiple injections should be made circumferentially in the wall around a lesion, although in practice many simply make a single large injection. Each injection should be of sufficient volume to raise a bluish bleb within the mucosa at the injection site. The injection volume may vary from 0.1 to 0.5 mL. If injections are made a few centimeters from the lesion, the surgeon should be informed whether the injections are proximal or distal to the site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69334\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69334 \">picture 2</a>). We recommend that, at a minimum, three sites in three different quadrants be marked. </p><p>Occasionally, the site of the carbon particles injection cannot be visualized at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/6,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,30,31</a>]. This may be due to a lack of circumferential injections. In addition, it could occur because the dye was not injected properly. If a submucosal bleb of <span class=\"nowrap\">blue/black</span> coloration is not observed during the injection, then the needle is either too far into the wall with the injection solution flowing into the peritoneal cavity, or it is too superficial with the carbon suspension leaking out the needle track into the intestinal lumen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tattooing has been shown to be effective in localizing colonic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/6,7,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,32</a>]. In one report, preoperative tattooing of intracolonic lesions was 100 percent effective for localization of a polypectomy site and resulted in reduced operative time and blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a study using sterile India ink solution, 62 of 63 patients who had preoperative lesion marking had it visualized intraoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In 1 of the 62 patients, the staining was too diffuse and intraoperative colonoscopy was required to localize the lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications with India ink injection are very rare and may be related in part to the wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds contained in the ink solution such as carriers, stabilizers, binders, and fungicides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>]. Microabscesses at the site of injection have been described but are of unclear clinical significance. The pure carbon suspension in sterile formulations has not been associated with any complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>It is possible that the toxic properties of India ink may be partially reduced by dilution of the ink. Ink diluted to 1:100 with saline produces as dark a spectrophotometric pattern as undiluted India ink, and in clinical tests, the tattoo made by 1:100 diluted India ink is readily visible to the endoscopist and operating surgeon. Another advantage of diluting the ink is that endoscopic visualization is still possible should some of the ink spill into the lumen, whereas, with the more concentrated solutions, the endoscopic picture becomes totally black when ink covers the bowel wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one study of 63 patients marked preoperatively, 6 had spillage of ink into the peritoneal cavity, and only 1 patient had symptoms of &quot;mild chilling&quot; without fever or abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>If there is any doubt about the trajectory that the injection needle is taking, a submucosal injection of a saline bleb can direct the ink into the submucosal space. Safety may also be enhanced by using only a small volume injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. The injection volume may vary with some endoscopists preferring small volumes (less than 1 mL) while others may inject 2 to 5 mL per site.</p><p>Endoscopic tattooing may result in submucosal fibrosis that can interfere with advanced resection techniques (eg, endoscopic submucosal dissection) when resection is performed at a later time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. India ink injection may also distort images during use of an endocytoscope, a high-magnification endoscopic technique for improving detection of early recurrences after colonoscopic resection of high-risk or malignant adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confocal-laser-endomicroscopy-and-endocytoscopy#H455771667\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy&quot;, section on 'Endocytoscopy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is our practice to inject a permanent marker during the initial colonoscopy if a lesion cannot be removed or if an endoscopically removed polyp has clinical features that may require surgical resection or surveillance colonoscopy. If marker injection was not performed and the histology report is unfavorable, tattooing is performed within two weeks to ensure that the site is still visible. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for lesion localization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ideal method for lesion localization is to have an easily identifiable marker that will immediately draw the attention of the surgeon or endoscopist. Most experience with dye injection has been with India ink. A commercial suspension of carbon particles (SPOT) is available and widely used. This formulation has the advantage of being sterilized and prediluted. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Tattooing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications with India ink injection are very rare. Microabscesses at the site of injection have been described, but are of unclear clinical significance. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72440022\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and UpToDate would like to thank Dr. Jerome Waye, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Stanciu C, Trifan A, Khder SA.
