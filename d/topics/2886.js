At the tip of the glans is the urethral meatus, which allows for urination and ejection of semen. The proximal rounded surface of the glans penis is called the corona and serves as the junction between the glans and the penile shaft.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The foreskin is an extension of the shaft skin, which covers the glans penis at birth. Circumcision is a procedure that removes the foreskin at birth or later in life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penile lymphatics drain both the glans penis and shaft and form an interconnecting network of channels. Drainage proceeds from the superficial inguinal lymph nodes to the deep inguinal lymph nodes and then to the external iliac lymph nodes in the pelvis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282022446\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penile carcinoma almost always presents with a skin abnormality or palpable lesion on the penis. The majority of cancers arise on the glans, in the coronal sulcus, or on the prepuce as either a mass or ulceration, and they may be associated with a secondary infection. In a series of 243 men with newly diagnosed penile cancer, the most common signs were a painless lump (25 percent) or ulcer (13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other signs included a rash (6 percent), bleeding (4 percent), or balanitis (4 percent).</p><p>Penile cancer is typically a disease of older men, and rates increase steadily with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The mean age at diagnosis is 60 years, although penile cancer can be seen in men less than 40 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

Lymphadenopathy in the remainder presumably represents an inflammatory reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Distant metastases are uncommon until late in the disease course, with only 1 to 10 percent of cases having distant metastases at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>].

The diagnosis requires biopsy for tissue confirmation.</p><p>The initial evaluation of a penile mass or ulcer depends upon whether the clinical presentation suggests that infection or malignancy is more likely:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an infection appears to be more likely (eg, erythema, swelling, discharge), a four- to six-week course of antifungals or antibiotics may be indicated, depending on the clinical exam. The use of steroids is reserved for patients with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of an inflammatory lesion (ie, lichen sclerosus). Lesions that do not resolve after six weeks or that progress at any time during antibiotic or antifungal therapy should be biopsied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Balanitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men presenting with a penile lesion suspicious for malignancy or with a penile lesion and associated lymphadenopathy, our approach is to proceed with an immediate biopsy of the penile lesion. If this is positive, evaluation of the regional lymph nodes is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H370431933\" class=\"local\">'Regional lymph node assessment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of other physical signs (eg, firm subcutaneous skin nodules at distant sites) or symptoms (eg, cachexia, confusion, cough, or bone pain) may indicate the presence of distant metastatic disease or associated metabolic abnormalities, such as hypercalcemia. Such patients require a full laboratory and imaging evaluation in addition to biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H2336719302\" class=\"local\">'Assessment for distant metastatic disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Biopsy can be performed using punch, incisional, or excisional techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Excisional biopsy is appropriate when the complete lesion can be removed and closed with little or no alteration to penile form and function. Otherwise, incisional or deep punch biopsies are performed.</p><p>All patients require close follow-up to prevent an unnecessary delay in diagnosis and treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1191415403\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive diagnosis of penile malignancy is based upon the biopsy of the penile lesion. An incisional or deep punch biopsy is preferred because it provides the most information to guide subsequent staging and treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2550255145\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 95 percent of malignant lesions of the penis are squamous cell carcinoma. A number of other rare malignancies can also arise in the penis.

The plaques are erythematous, with sharply defined margins that are raised above the surrounding normal skin. Typical psoriatic scales may not be present due to the moisture in the genital area. These lesions are usually asymptomatic, although some patients complain of pruritus. Psoriasis is rarely limited to the penis, and the presence of psoriatic scales elsewhere helps distinguish psoriasis from penile cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of psoriasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Angiokeratomas </strong>&ndash; Angiokeratomas are uncommon, benign, violaceous papules with overlying scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F95066\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95066 \">picture 1</a>). Penile angiokeratomas often occur on the glans penis but can be found on the scrotum, thigh, and elsewhere. Typically, they are multiple and measure less than 1 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The small size and multiplicity are useful in distinguishing angiokeratomas from penile cancer, which is more commonly a single, larger lesion. In most patients, the lesions are asymptomatic and do not require treatment; however, intermittent bleeding, pruritus, and pain can occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lichen planus</strong> &ndash; Lichen planus involving the penis is characterized by violaceous papules on the glans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53806%7EDERM%2F76913\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53806 graphicRef76913 \">picture 2A-B</a>). Unlike penile cancer, lichen planus lesions are rarely asymptomatic. Most patients experience pruritus, which can be severe and become intensely painful if the lesions ulcerate or erode. The disease usually heals with significant postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-planus#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lichen planus&quot;, section on 'Genital lichen planus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282022496\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious conditions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genital herpes</strong> &ndash; Genital herpes is caused by infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) or 2 (HSV2). The initial presentation can be severe, with painful genital ulcers in association with other manifestations, including systemic symptoms (eg, fever, headache, malaise) and tender local inguinal lymphadenopathy. In contrast, cancerous lesions are usually painless and not associated with systemic symptoms. A clinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed with laboratory testing.

Primary syphilis can present with a painless papule on the penis. With time, the papule ulcerates to produce the classic chancre of primary syphilis, a 1 to 2 cm ulcer with a raised, indurated margin. The ulcer generally has a nonexudative base and is associated with mild to moderate regional lymphadenopathy, which is often bilateral. Multiple chancres can occur, particularly in the setting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Unlike penile cancer, chancres heal spontaneously within three to six weeks, even in the absence of treatment.

These premalignant lesions are generally differentiated from squamous cell carcinoma by biopsy.</p><p>The extent to which premalignant lesions precede invasive carcinoma is unknown. The available evidence suggests that the majority of cases of penile squamous cell carcinoma arise de novo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, in one series, only 39 of 511 men with penile cancer (8 percent) had a history of a previous or concomitant lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Condyloma acuminata</strong> &ndash; Condyloma acuminata, also known as genital or venereal warts, are soft papillomatous growths that are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the anogenital area.

It has a typical velvety red, well-marginated appearance. The lesions are usually solitary and occasionally erode or ulcerate, but pain is uncommon. In this regard, they may appear quite similar to penile carcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Erythroplasia of Queyrat usually affects older, uncircumcised men.

However, outside of the United States, the UICC implemented the eighth edition changes effective January 1, 2017. Given the differences in assigning stage between the seventh and eighth editions, it is important to designate which edition is used. </p><p>The eighth edition changes include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The International Society of Urologic Pathology (ISUP) Grading System [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] was adopted.

When the depth or extent of tumor infiltration cannot be determined by clinical exam, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help identify invasion into the corpora cavernosum or spongiosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The extent of the primary tumor is combined with the pathologic factors present in the tumor, such as histologic grade, the status of lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion, for staging and treatment planning. Thus, an adequate deep tumor biopsy is important to capture this information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H370431933\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional lymph node assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penile cancer initially spreads through the lymphatics, with the initial site of involvement being the inguinal nodes, followed sequentially by the pelvic and retroperitoneal nodes. Accurate assessment of regional lymph nodes is essential for proper management since resection of small-volume, pathologically involved regional lymph nodes can be curative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>For clinical staging, factors determining nodal stage include the location, size, and number of any palpable lymph nodes and whether or not such lymph nodes are fixed or mobile. Pathologic staging factors include the number of involved nodes and whether or not extranodal extension or pelvic lymph node metastases are present. </p><p>The presence or absence of lymph node involvement also provides important prognostic information. The single most important prognostic factors influencing survival in patients with penile cancer are the presence and extent of nodal metastases. In a review of the literature, the five-year cancer-specific survival stratified by the extent of nodal involvement was [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No inguinal node metastases &ndash; 85 to 100 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single inguinal lymph node metastasis &ndash; 79 to 89 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral or multiple inguinal node metastases &ndash; 17 to 60 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic node metastases &ndash; 0 to 17 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3209131654\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical assessment of inguinal lymph nodes is not entirely reliable. A false-negative clinical evaluation of the inguinal region based upon palpation alone has been reported in 9 to 60 percent of patients, depending on pathologic features of the primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. False-positive assessments are also frequent.</p><p>For men with a high body mass index (BMI), men who have had prior inguinal procedures, and men presenting with clinical adenopathy, we perform imaging along with physical examination because of the limited accuracy of the physical examination alone in these settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Imaging studies used in the setting of clinically negative nodes, especially where physical examination may be unreliable, include computed tomography (CT), MRI, or inguinal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. CT images fused with positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(CT/PET)</span> have been shown to be helpful among patients with clinically positive inguinal nodes to indicate the presence of both pelvic and distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Pathologic staging of inguinal lymph nodes is required for patients with palpable lymphadenopathy and for those at high risk for metastases based upon pathologic features noted in the primary tumor. Staging of the inguinal region in men with invasive penile primary tumors and no palpable adenopathy may be done by ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA), dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB), or superficial or modified inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND). The latter invasive procedure requires intraoperative frozen sections of lymph nodes to aid in treatment planning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520128685\"><span class=\"h3\">Fine needle aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FNA is a minimally invasive method to evaluate for malignancy in men who present with palpable adenopathy. It is performed without local anesthesia using a 23 to 27 gauge needle. Both the sensitivity and specificity of FNA among men with clinically palpable nodes are over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>However, the sensitivity is much lower among men without palpable lymphadenopathy. As an example, in one such study, the sensitivity of ultrasound-guided FNA was 39 percent (9 of 23 groins containing metastases), with a specificity of 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57524445\"><span class=\"h3\">Dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy are based upon the concept that penile cancers have specific patterns of lymphatic spread and that one or more lymph nodes (ie, sentinel nodes) are the first to be involved with metastatic disease within a given lymph node basin.</p><p>DSNB utilizes the injection of the penile tumor with vital blue dye and radioactive tracer, followed by examination of the draining inguinal lymph nodes. If the sentinel lymph nodes are not involved, the entire basin should be free of tumor.</p><p>A 2012 meta-analysis of 17 studies reported on the detection rate and sensitivity of sentinel node biopsy in penile cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pooled sensitivity was 88 percent (95% CI 83-92).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When studies that included patients with palpable nodes were excluded, the pooled sensitivity increased to 90 percent (95% CI 85-94).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Incorporation of inguinal ultrasound increased the pooled sensitivity of sentinel node biopsy to 93 percent.</p><p/><p>Sentinel lymph node biopsy should be performed at centers staffed by experienced surgeons and nuclear medicine specialists to decrease the risk of a false-negative result. This recommendation is consistent with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for penile cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The importance of experience was demonstrated in a 2010 study that included 342 patients assessed with a modi&#64257;ed DSNB protocol from two high-volume centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In this experience, the false-negative rate was 2 percent (six patients with groin metastases after a negative DSNB). However, in another center, the false-negative rate approached 15 percent while the technique was evolving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1750078116\"><span class=\"h3\">Superficial inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A superficial ILND provides more information than biopsy of a single node or group of nodes. This dissection is readily performed by any surgeon experienced in inguinal surgery, without the need for specialized equipment.</p><p>Superficial ILND can identify microscopic metastases in patients with a clinically normal inguinal examination without the need for a pelvic dissection. This was demonstrated in a retrospective study of 31 men, most of whom had nonpalpable inguinal nodes at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. There were no recurrences among men who underwent a superficial ILND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. However, superficial ILND was associated with a higher overall complication rate compared with DSNB (12 to 35 versus 5 to 7 percent, respectively). </p><p>A contemporary study has shown that superficial ILND can be performed using a minimally invasive robotic-assisted approach, with similar lymph node yields compared with open surgical approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Similarly, laparoscopic surgical resection techniques have been described that appear to be feasible from an oncologic standpoint as staging procedures. The efficacy of such procedures in terms of long-term recurrence rates and complications, however, await further follow-up prior to routine use in community practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4024952164\"><span class=\"h3\">Modified ILND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modified ILND is similar to a superficial dissection in creating thick skin flaps, sparing the saphenous vein, and reducing the borders of dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/carcinoma-of-the-penis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]. However, it differs from a superficial dissection in that nodes within the fossa ovalis are also removed by dissecting down to the femoral vessels. In one series that included nine patients, there were no inguinal recurrences among patients with negative nodes postdissection with 67 months follow-up.
