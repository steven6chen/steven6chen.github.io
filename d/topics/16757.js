SLE in children is fundamentally the same disease as in adults, with similar etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings. However, the care of children and adolescents with SLE is different from that of adults because of the impact of the disease and its therapy on physical and psychologic growth and development. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment, complications, and prognosis of SLE in children are reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and classification of SLE in children are discussed separately.

Patients require monitoring at regular intervals by a rheumatologist to optimize both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies and achieve treatment goals. Patients often have multiorgan system involvement and may require multidisciplinary care. Assessment of disease activity and severity and nonpharmacologic interventions are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;, section on 'Assessment of disease activity and severity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults#H924035\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic and preventive interventions'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians caring for children must be especially conscious of the effects of medications, such as glucocorticoids, on growth and physical appearance in children and adolescents. The unique problems related to growth and development effect both the need for and the impact of aggressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Failure of therapy of childhood SLE frequently results from efforts to care for a child or adolescent with a complex and chronic disease without considering the special needs of the growing individual and his or her family. As a result, clinicians who are unprepared to deal with these needs should refer these patients to a pediatric rheumatology center. (See <a href=\"#H75093852\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75093852\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians caring for children with SLE must remember that normal laboratory values for children differ from those for adults. As an example, a &quot;normal&quot; serum creatinine concentration in a child younger than 10 years of age is 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (44 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. As a result, a level of 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (97 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> while &quot;normal&quot; in an adult, represents substantially decreased renal clearance in a young child. In addition, levels of compromised renal function that may have no clear adverse effect among adults may be sufficient to affect normal growth and development in a child or adolescent.</p><p>The emotional impact of SLE and its treatment also makes the care of children and adolescents distinct. Adolescence is a period of substantial psychologic stress associated with evolving self-identity. It is very difficult for these children to internalize the concept of chronic illness. The resultant sense of being different is markedly intensified by changes in their appearance, whether directly caused by the illness or as a result of therapy (eg, glucocorticoids). Failure to deal appropriately with these issues often leads to noncompliance and a poor outcome.</p><p>In particular, high-dose glucocorticoids have a profound impact on growth and appearance in children and adolescents. This impact is often associated with both physical impairment (ie, short stature <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> osteonecrosis) and psychological devastation. For many adolescents with SLE, their current cushingoid appearance is of greater significance than any potential future event. Thus, both overt and covert suicide attempts (eg, surreptitious refusal to take necessary medications) are well recognized in centers caring for large numbers of adolescents. The treating clinician must do everything possible to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity and maximize compliance with the treatment regimen (including the use of other immunosuppressive agents). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal behavior in children and adolescents: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature#H543524649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoid therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75093892\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The agent that best combines safety and efficacy for the treatment of SLE is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a>. Additional agents are also used and vary depending upon disease severity and response to treatment. The most common additional agent used is glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H75094006\" class=\"local\">'Mild SLE'</a> below and <a href=\"#H75094078\" class=\"local\">'Moderate SLE'</a> below and <a href=\"#H75094160\" class=\"local\">'Severe SLE'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Hydroxychloroquine</a> alone may be sufficient in children with mild disease, whereas additional disease-modifying agents are necessary in children with more severe end-organ involvement. There is general agreement among adult and pediatric rheumatologists, however, that all patients with SLE should receive hydroxychloroquine during the entire course of the disease, including during pregnancy. In order to minimize the risk of irreversible visual damage, the hydroxychloroquine dose should be &le;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> and these children should have regular ophthalmic evaluations, including color vision and visual field testing. Ocular screening in SLE is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimalarial-drugs-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatic-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimalarial drugs in the treatment of rheumatic disease&quot;, section on 'Ocular health'</a>.)</p><p>A review of 95 studies examining the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chloroquine</a> on SLE found strong evidence of a beneficial effect on disease activity and survival and convincing, though weaker, evidence of improvements in irreversible organ damage, thromboses, atherosclerosis, bone mineral density (BMD), and lipid profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Adverse events from these agents were uncommon and tended to be mild, although in rare cases use was associated with irreversible retinal toxicity. However, this agent works slowly and should not be expected to remedy more significant disease manifestations in a timely manner. Thus, it is generally best used as an addition to other agents rather than alone.</p><p>Most children with SLE are treated with glucocorticoids in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a>. While glucocorticoids are known to be effective in treating childhood SLE based upon extensive clinical experience and observational studies, there are no data regarding optimal dosing. Thus, dosing and duration of glucocorticoids are decided on an individual basis and depend upon the clinical severity, combination of disease manifestations, and response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As examples, a lower initial dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> and more rapid taper are suitable for a patient with milder disease who responds quickly to treatment, whereas a child with severe lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric involvement may be treated with pulse intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> (10 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> for up to three doses) followed by oral prednisone (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> that is tapered over many months. (See <a href=\"#H75094006\" class=\"local\">'Mild SLE'</a> below and <a href=\"#H75094078\" class=\"local\">'Moderate SLE'</a> below and <a href=\"#H75094160\" class=\"local\">'Severe SLE'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75094006\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild SLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative care is indicated for the child with mild SLE who does not have renal or other life-threatening organ system involvement. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; to control musculoskeletal manifestations) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (&le;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day up to 200 mg in most children with an adult maximum of 400 mg per day) is often sufficient in this setting. NSAIDs that have a sulfa component, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sulindac</a>, should be avoided since sulfa antibiotic allergy is more common in patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Any other NSAID is suitable, although patients with SLE are at increased risk of developing aseptic meningitis from NSAIDs, especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. NSAIDs should be discontinued once musculoskeletal manifestations have resolved. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Dapsone</a> may be helpful for the occasional child with primarily dermatologic manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Low-dose glucocorticoids (less than 0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>) are often necessary to attain adequate disease control in children with mild SLE. However, long-term use of even such low amounts should be avoided, if possible, since doses above 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day may adversely affect longitudinal growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. We suggest adding a steroid-sparing agent, if glucocorticoids in a dose of greater than 0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> are required for more than three months. Choice of the second-line therapy depends on disease severity and specific organ involvement.</p><p>Children with mild disease are increasingly common in large centers as more pediatricians identify such patients through appropriate screening for SLE.

Options for managing glucocorticoid toxicity include higher-dose alternate-day oral therapy, intermittent intravenous high-dose therapy, or addition of a steroid-sparing agent. At the author's institution, children whose disease does not quickly come under control with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids are promptly advanced to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil. If there are persistent disease manifestations, they may be advanced to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rituximab</a>.

An alternative regimen is intermittent intravenous high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a>, which has the advantage of shutting down the lupus interferon signature (ie, decrease expression of particular interferon genes that are upregulated in SLE), an effect that is not seen with oral glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The author does not use methotrexate, because it is potentially nephrotoxic and may unexpectedly reach toxic levels if kidney function deteriorates since it is excreted in the urine. Monitoring for methotrexate toxicity is reviewed in the specific drug topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75094160\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe SLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children and adolescents with severe SLE (eg, substantial renal or neurologic disease) require more aggressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2,9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9,14</a>]. As in adults, children with the diffuse proliferative type of lupus nephritis have the worst prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Initial treatment is the same as is used for moderate SLE. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Cyclophosphamide</a> is used in patients with life-threatening lupus nephritis immediately upon diagnosis in most institutions and in patients unable to taper the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> dose sufficiently. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil is the most commonly used alternative to cyclophosphamide in patients with severe SLE.

It has since been used routinely in children with moderate to severe SLE who cannot be maintained on an acceptable level of glucocorticoids and other glucocorticoid-sparing agents or in whom adherence to an oral regimen is problematic. It is also increasingly used as an additional induction agent in children who do not respond to initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a> and glucocorticoids, before trying another steroid-sparing agent.</p><p>With extensive use, monthly intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> was found to permit a reduction in daily glucocorticoid use to a minimal level and was associated with acceptable long-term safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, its use has broadened to include all children with moderate or severe SLE who cannot be adequately controlled on a lower dose of glucocorticoid and another steroid-sparing agent. Specifically, we use intravenous cyclophosphamide in children who cannot otherwise be maintained on a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> dose of less than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day despite use of steroid-sparing agents. The length of immunosuppressive therapy varies based upon organ involvement. In children with nephritis, for example, there is an unacceptable frequency of disease flare when cyclophosphamide is discontinued after the initial seven doses without substitution with an alternative immunosuppressive agent. In contrast, a one-year course may be sufficient for those with extrarenal disease only.</p><p>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> appears to have the best documented long-term success rate in children and adults with severe SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>], despite scattered studies suggesting comparable outcomes with agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The regimen we prefer is based upon the National Institutes of Health (NIH) protocol developed during the 1980s and 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It consists of monthly intravenous pulses of cyclophosphamide (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> increasing to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/m<sup>2</sup></span> as tolerated) for six months (seven doses), followed by maintenance therapy with mofetil mycophenolate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">azathioprine</a>.

In general, there are no efficacy data in children to support the use of a specific steroid-sparing agent. However, mycophenolate mofetil is associated with a significant incidence of stomach upset and requires consistent twice or three times daily dosing to be effective. As a result, adherence can become problematic, particularly in adolescents. Gastrointestinal side effects are reduced with an enteric-coated formulation, and mycophenolate levels can be monitored. Some patients may need alteration of the usual dosing due to personal pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics.

The care of children and adolescents with SLE differs from that of adults because of the impact of the disease and its therapy on physical and psychologic growth and development. (See <a href=\"#H75093712\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment for most manifestations of SLE does not differ among adults, children, and adolescents. However, children and adolescents with SLE have unique problems related to growth and development that affect both the need for and the impact of aggressive therapy. The profound negative effects of glucocorticoids during physical and psychologic growth and development necessitate minimizing the dose whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H75093730\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend treating all children with SLE with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a> at a dose &le;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (up to a maximum of 400 mg per day) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H75093892\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We typically use a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in conjunction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a> to control musculoskeletal manifestations in the child with mild SLE who does not have a requirement for glucocorticoids or renal or other life-threatening organ system involvement. However, this regimen may not be sufficient in the child with poor adherence. (See <a href=\"#H75094006\" class=\"local\">'Mild SLE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest treating all children with moderate to severe SLE with glucocorticoids in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Dosing and duration of glucocorticoids are decided on an individual basis and depend upon the clinical severity, combination of disease manifestations, and response to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H75094078\" class=\"local\">'Moderate SLE'</a> above and <a href=\"#H75094160\" class=\"local\">'Severe SLE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prolonged use of high-dose glucocorticoids is associated with significant toxicity. Thus, we suggest adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil or another steroid-sparing agent in children with moderate SLE that require continued use of high-dose glucocorticoids to control disease activity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H75094078\" class=\"local\">'Moderate SLE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children and adolescents with severe SLE (eg, substantial renal or neurologic disease), or those with moderate disease that does not quickly come under control, require more aggressive therapy. We suggest monthly intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclophosphamide</a> in children with moderate or severe SLE who cannot be maintained on a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> dose of less than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Extended immunosuppressive therapy is often required for patients with renal disease, but a one-year course may be sufficient for those with extrarenal disease only. (See <a href=\"#H75094160\" class=\"local\">'Severe SLE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with specific disease manifestations may require additional therapy beyond the usual treatment for SLE. These treatments are reviewed above and in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"#H75094870\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of specific organ system involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of SLE include macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and infections such as pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H75096025\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The survival rate for children and adolescents with SLE is nearly 100 percent at 5 years and at least 85 percent at 10 years. Higher mortality rates are associated with lower socioeconomic status of the family, increased disease activity, and central nervous system (CNS) or renal involvement. (See <a href=\"#H75096333\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3019484848\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Thomas JA Lehman, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-treatment-complications-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">van Vollenhoven RF, Mosca M, Bertsias G, et al.
