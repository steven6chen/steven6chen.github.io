This observation was corroborated when, during periods of food shortage in the Second World War, the symptoms of his patients improved once bread was replaced by unconventional, non-cereal-containing foods; this finding confirmed the usefulness of earlier, empirical diets that used pure fruit, potatoes, banana, milk, or meat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Since symptoms reoccurred when bread was reintroduced after the war, Dicke and van de Kamer initiated controlled experiments exposing children with celiac disease to defined diets and then determined fecal weight and fecal fat as a measure of malabsorption. Wheat, barley, rye, and (to a minor degree) oats triggered malabsorption, which could be reversed after exclusion of these &quot;toxic&quot; cereals from the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Shortly after, the toxic agents were found to be present in gluten, the alcohol-soluble fraction of wheat protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The celiac lesion in the proximal small intestine was first described in 1954. The primary findings were mucosal inflammation, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76680\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76680 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. With the development of peroral biopsy, it became apparent that celiac disease and adult nontropical sprue shared the same features and pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When unrecognized and untreated, celiac disease is associated with increased mortality. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Risk of malignancy and mortality'</a> below.)</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease will be reviewed here. Its management and the use of antibodies for diagnosis are presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>). This topic is also discussed in an official position statement issued by the American Gastroenterological Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequent intrafamilial occurrence and the remarkably close association with the HLA-DQ2 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> DQ8 gene loci provide the basis of our current understanding of celiac disease as an immune disorder that is triggered by an environmental agent (the gliadin component of gluten) in genetically predisposed individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. It has been estimated that the HLA contribution to the development of celiac disease among siblings is 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, another gene or genes at an HLA-unlinked locus must also participate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. A particular association was found with chromosome 15q26, which contains a type 1 diabetes susceptibility locus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and with chromosome 5q and possibly 11q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>HLA typing for DQ2 (DQA1*05; DQB1*02) and DQ8 (DQA1*03; DQB1*0302) may be useful in individuals with equivocal small bowel histologic findings since celiac disease is unlikely if neither is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Homozygosity for HLA DQ2 has been associated with an increased risk for celiac disease and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. This was also demonstrated in a prospective multinational study of 6403 children with HLA haplotype DR3-DQ2 or DR4-DQ8 followed from birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In DR3-DQ2 homozygotes, the cumulative risk of celiac autoimmunity and celiac disease by the age of five years were 26 and 11 percent, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F96365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96365 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Non-HLA locus genes conferring risk for celiac disease have also been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and an increasing number of non-HLA risk alleles has been associated with an increased risk of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A genome wide association study in large numbers of patients with celiac disease and matched controls from the United Kingdom, Italy, and Ireland identified a number of genes involved in controlling immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, type 1 diabetes and celiac disease share common genetic risk regions (including HLA-DQ). However, the new polymorphisms, even when taken together, contribute only 3 to 4 percent to the genetic risk for celiac disease, as compared with 30 to 40 percent for HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic studies are now used to further confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease. These include the ELISA for IgA antibodies to gliadin and the immunofluorescence test for IgA antibodies to endomysium, a structure of the smooth muscle connective tissue, the presence of which is virtually pathognomonic for celiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80588\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80588 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The target autoantigen contained within the endomysium was identified as tissue transglutaminase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. IgA-antibodies against endomysium and the endomysial autoantigen tissue transglutaminase are highly sensitive and specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Some studies also revealed a high sensitivity and specificity for IgG antibodies against deamidated gluten peptides, almost reaching that of IgA anti-transglutaminase antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Widespread use of these serologic tests has allowed earlier diagnosis, large scale population screening and thereby an improved understanding of its epidemiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gliadin reactive T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue transglutaminase is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released by inflammatory and endothelial cells and fibroblasts in response to mechanical irritation or inflammation. Once it has been secreted, it crosslinks glutamine-rich proteins such as gluten proteins from wheat. However, it can also deamidate glutamine residues in gluten to glutamic acid. Deamidation produces a negative charge in gluten peptides that increases their binding to HLA-DQ2 and DQ8, which potentiates their capacity to stimulate T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>Initial studies suggested that, in adult patients, the dominant epitope responsible for the T-cell response appeared to be a deamidated glutamine residue (Q65E) of alpha gliadin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In contrast, younger patients appeared to have a less restricted T-cell response with reactivity to a diverse set of gliadin and glutenin peptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This suggested that there may be a broad group of different gluten peptides that activate celiac disease in children, while with advancing age the T-cell response narrows to only a few deamidated peptides. However, a later study suggests that there is a broader range of gliadin peptides recognized by T cells in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>A common feature is the recognition of epitopes in gliadins that are located in regions rich in proline residues. A 33 amino acid peptide (A-gliadin, peptide 56-89) that is particularly resistant to gastrointestinal peptidases has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. One study demonstrated that this peptide can be completely degraded by enterocytes in controls but only partly in celiac patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Enterocytes from patients with celiac disease also showed only limited digestion of peptide 31-49 of A-gliadin, a peptide that is not recognized by <span class=\"nowrap\">HLA-DQ2/DQ8</span>. The high stability against proteolysis or the incomplete degradation of these gliadin peptides favors them as important initiators of the inflammatory response and toxic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Innate immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Innate responses to wheat proteins (in addition to gluten-mediated activation of pathogenic T cells) are also involved in the immune response, and perhaps even necessary to trigger the gliadin specific (adaptive) T-cell response in genetically predisposed individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The innate immune system uses &quot;pattern recognition receptors&quot; to provide an early response to stimuli such as RNA, DNA, lipopolysaccharide, or viral proteins in contrast to the adaptive immune system, which depends upon HLA-presentation of antigen, its T-cell recognition and T-cell expansion. In celiac disease, gluten peptides have been implicated as triggers of innate immune responses in intestinal epithelial but also in mononuclear cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/35-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-41</a>]. </p><p>However, this was not confirmed in a study which identified a family of non-gluten proteins, the wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), as activators of innate immunity in macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells via toll-like receptor 4, the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Notably, these ATIs are pest resistance proteins of gluten containing cereals, whose content has increased in the last few decades. ATIs are highly resistant to intestinal degradation and induce low level intestinal inflammation after oral ingestion. They are possibly the major cause of nonceliac &quot;gluten sensitivity,&quot; which is defined as dose-dependent intolerance to gluten-containing cereals after exclusion of celiac disease or wheat allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Suggestive clinical features but negative serologic tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoantibodies and intraepithelial lymphocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative pathogenic importance of humoral versus the established role of cellular immunity in the pathogenesis of celiac disease is uncertain. In a cell culture system, autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase blocked intestinal epithelial differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/28,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,45</a>]. Tissue transglutaminase may support the bioactivation of transforming growth factor beta 1, which is required for epithelial differentiation, a process that is impaired in celiac disease. Some inhibitory effect of isolated autoantibodies on tissue transglutaminase activity was also demonstrated in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, residual enzymatic activity appears to be sufficient for protein crosslinking and (gliadin) deamidation reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Therefore, the mucosal tTG activity in celiac disease, which cannot be completely blocked by the locally produced autoantibodies, may have a role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/27,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,48</a>].</p><p>The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, which mainly bear the unusual gamma-delta T-cell receptor, is increased in patients with active, gluten-sensitive sprue compared with normal subjects, while patients with refractory sprue (which is of uncertain relationship to celiac disease) also have aberrant lymphocytes with restricted gene rearrangements. The intraepithelial T lymphocytes show increased expression of interferon gamma and IL-10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, the pathogenetic role of these lymphocytes, compared with the lamina propria lymphocytes, is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and several inflammatory conditions, such as enteric infections and drug and food allergies that are unrelated to celiac disease can cause intraepithelial lymphocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Gliadin receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gliadin receptor(s) on intestinal epithelial cells may mediate the transport of gliadin peptides to the lamina propria where T-cell activation occurs. Identification of the receptors could lead to non-dietary therapies of celiac disease by creating drugs that interfere with receptor function. A study found that CD71 (the transferrin receptor) was increased in patients with celiac disease and was also expressed at the apical pole of enterocytes, in contrast to its usual location at the basolateral pole of enterocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. CD71 colocalized with secretory IgA and seemed to be responsible for the apical to basal retrotransport of secretory IgA. The authors concluded gluten peptides that are bound to secretory IgA (ie, IgA anti-gliadin antibodies) may be protected from degradation by the enterocytes, leading to accumulation in the lamina propria where T-cell stimulation occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

CXCR3 is usually expressed on T cells where it mediates their recruitment to sites of inflammation. Somewhat unexpectedly, CXCR3 was found on enterocytes, and increased levels were detected in intestinal tissue of patients with active celiac disease. The increased levels returned to baseline after introduction of a gluten-free diet. In cell lines, binding of gliadin to CXCR3 was followed by the recruitment of MyD88, which led to enhanced intestinal permeability.</p><p>Several questions remain unanswered and final proof of a central and specific gliadin (gluten) receptor on intestinal epithelial cells remains to be established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Celiac disease occurs primarily in whites of northern European ancestry. Reports in the 1950s suggested that the prevalence of celiac disease among Europeans ranged between 1:4000 and 1:8000. However, this diagnosis was based upon a clinical presentation with classic symptoms of malabsorption. </p><p>The picture changed in the 1970s with rising awareness of the often oligosymptomatic form of celiac disease and the advent of sensitive and specific serologic assays for IgA antibodies to gliadin and endomysium. In a report from Denmark, screening assays increased the estimated prevalence of celiac disease from 1:10,000 to 1:300 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In another cross-sectional study of 7798 individuals ages six years and older conducted in the United States, 1:141 individuals had either previously been diagnosed with celiac disease or had positive IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase and endomysium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Epidemiological studies using these tests with biopsy verification have reported prevalences of 1:70 to 1:300 in most countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefit of screening for asymptomatic celiac disease has not yet been established. Screening could result in the recognition and treatment of unrecognized nutritional deficiency states, resolution of mild symptoms, and a potential reduction in the risk for malignancy. However, these benefits require compliance of asymptomatic patients with a difficult dietary regimen which can reduce quality of life.</p><p>Screening programs based upon antibody testing have demonstrated a high prevalence of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/22,57-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,57-63</a>]. In a screening study of 4615 adults from northern Italy, for example, IgA endomysial antibodies had a positive predictive value of 100 percent; comparable values for IgG and IgA antigliadin antibodies were only 2 and 12 percent, respectively, because of their lower specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Population-based studies have suggested that recognized cases of celiac disease may only represent the tip of the celiac iceberg. One of the largest screening investigations of celiac disease was performed in 17,201 school children, aged 6 to 15 years, who were recruited from several regions of Italy and represented 69 percent of the eligible population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

In the at-risk groups, the prevalence of celiac disease was 1:22 in first-degree relatives, 1:39 in second-degree relatives, 1:56 in symptomatic patients, and 1:133 in the not-at-risk groups. These estimates are similar to those found in the European studies described above.</p><p>Even those not ethnically derived from European populations can develop celiac disease if they have an appropriate genetic background. Punjabis and Gujaratis from India who lived in England developed this disorder 2.7 times as often as Europeans when on a gluten-rich diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many years, celiac disease was defined by a set of classic standards for diagnosis.

Although there is a gradient of decreasing severity from the proximal to the distal small intestine, correlating with the higher proximal concentration of dietary gluten, sampling error can occur due to spotty features of mucosal inflammation. The histologic severity ranges from a mild alteration characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (type 0 lesion) to a flat mucosa with total mucosal atrophy, complete loss of villi, enhanced epithelial apoptosis and crypt hyperplasia (type 3 lesion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76680\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76680 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/7,69-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,69-73</a>]. The type 4 lesion has the same histologic features seen in the type 3 lesion, except that lamina propria hyperplasia becomes hypoplasia. The type 4 lesion is characteristic of T-cell lymphoma.

Thus, the impressive clinical picture of a child with life-threatening malabsorption is often replaced by the mostly atypical presentation of adult celiac disease.

Thus, celiac disease may represent a continuum with variable degrees of severity. One study suggested that the severity of disease correlated with the concentration of tissue transglutaminase antibody levels, but this correlation is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>Establishing the diagnosis of subclinical celiac disease is of potential importance for four reasons: the danger of malignancy, the presence of unsuspected nutritional deficiencies, the association with low-birth weight infants in affected mothers, and the occurrence of autoimmune disorders. The risk of malignancy in patients with subclinical celiac disease is not known, although (as discussed above) it appears to be lower than in patients who present with malabsorption symptoms. However, once the disease is in remission with a gluten-free diet, the risk approaches that of the normal population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

The increase in some studies was limited to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/135-137\" class=\"abstract_t\">135-137</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the largest population-based studies to address this issue included 12,000 patients with celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis identified from a Swedish registry between 1964 and 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. Cancer was diagnosed in 249 patients during follow-up (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.5), suggesting that the overall increase in cancer risk was modest, especially compared with previous reports. Furthermore, the risk declined with increasing length of follow-up and was not increased in children or adolescents. The most common malignancy was lymphoma (SIR 5.9), which accounted for 18 percent of all cancers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67338\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67338 \">image 1</a>). The risk of lymphoma was considerably lower than in several earlier reports, in which the risk was estimated to be increased 15- to 100-fold. The risk of other digestive tract cancers was also increased, including oropharyngeal (mostly esophageal squamous cell), small intestinal adenocarcinoma, colorectal, and hepatocellular. In contrast, there was a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer.

There were a total of 134 malignancies in the celiac group (2.8 percent) The overall risk of malignancy was increased by approximately 30 percent (hazard ratio [HR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.06-1.55). The risk was highest for lymphoproliferative disease (HR 4.80) and gastrointestinal (GI) cancer (HR 1.85). Most cancers were detected in the first year after diagnosis. The study also confirmed a reduced risk of breast cancer (HR 0.35) and, in addition, found a reduced risk of lung cancer (0.34), the mechanisms for which are unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large Swedish cohort study which evaluated the risk of GI cancers in 28,882 patients with celiac disease (villous atrophy, Marsh score = 3), 12,860 with mild inflammation (Marsh score 1 to 2), and 3705 individuals with latent celiac disease (normal mucosa but positive serology), the risk of incident GI cancers was increased in all three groups in the first year of diagnosis (HR 5.95, 9.13, 8.10, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. Although the high incident cancer risk in the first year of diagnosis may be due to ascertainment bias, after the first year of diagnosis, the site-specific risk for small intestinal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma was increased in patients with celiac disease (HR 2.22 and 1.78) and inflammation (HR 2.49 and 2.17). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Furthermore, the same Swedish cohort revealed a significantly increased risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy in patients with villous atrophy (HR 2.82) compared with patients with intestinal inflammation but without villous atrophy (HR 1.81), but not in individuals with latent celiac disease (HR 0.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. This risk remained increased for five years or more after diagnosis. Individuals mainly suffered from Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

In several reports, between 2.6 and 7.8 percent of adults with type 1 diabetes had IgA autoantibodies to endomysium or to tissue transglutaminase; most such patients were proven to have celiac disease with small bowel biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/155,156\" class=\"abstract_t\">155,156</a>].

Other reports have demonstrated that as many as 3.5 percent of children of parents with type 1 diabetes have celiac disease, the prevalence of which increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>].</p><p>Type 1 diabetes and celiac disease share multiple genetic loci such as HLA-DR3, HLA-DQ2 (HLA-DQ8) and several genetic variations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/13,130,158\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,130,158</a>]. This suggests that type 1 diabetes and celiac disease have common features in their pathogenesis such as tissue damage from autoimmunity or intolerance to dietary antigens. Approximately one-third of type 1 diabetics who have the celiac disease-predisposing haplotype HLA-DQ2 (which is found in 20 to 25 percent of the general Western population) have raised IgA autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase and are therefore likely to have celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>].

Patients showed at best a trend toward an increased body mass index, but no change in folate or hemoglobin levels or insulin requirements. However, animal studies suggest that the interplay between gluten exposure and the intestinal immune system can modulate the development of type 1 diabetes. Substitutions of hydrolyzed casein instead of gluten in the diet delayed the onset of type 1 diabetes in BB rats, which spontaneously develop diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>], and a gluten-free diet reduced the incidence of type 1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice from 64 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-adults/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>].

Anti-tissue transglutaminase-based screening programs have revealed a high prevalence of undiagnosed celiac disease, reaching 1 percent or more. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease have a 10 to 15 percent risk of celiac disease. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of (serologic screening detected) celiac disease correlates with the carrier state of the major genetic predisposition (HLA-DQ2&gt;HLA-DQ8) and a high wheat consumption. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with celiac disease may present with classic symptoms related to malabsorption, including diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, and nutrient or vitamin deficiencies. However, the majority of patients with celiac disease exhibit only minor gastrointestinal complaints, have nongastrointestinal manifestations, or are asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Classic disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23610802\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous autoimmune conditions are frequently associated with celiac disease including dermatitis herpetiformis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune thyroiditis. Patients with celiac disease should therefore be screened for these conditions. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serological screening for celiac disease is indicated in patients with autoimmune conditions associated with celiac disease and in first-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease.
