If the patient has an entrenched maladaptive personality, the physician should modify the patient&rsquo;s treatment plan accordingly, which is usually accomplished more easily than trying to change the patient&rsquo;s personality. As an example, suspicious or mistrustful patients should receive more careful explanations, particularly before invasive or anxiety-provoking procedures. With narcissistic patients, the physician should take special care to avoid relating in ways that may be perceived by the patient as paternalistic or authoritarian. </p><p>Physicians should provide specific, realistic reassurance as part of a constructive treatment plan. Facile, nonspecific reassurance can undermine the physician&minus;patient relationship and alienate patients, who may conclude that the physician does not understand them. In addition, premature or unrealistic reassurance or an overly cheerful attitude may leave discouraged or demoralized patients feeling that the clinician lacks empathy. </p><p>Clinicians should attempt to reflect upon their own reactions to patients and recurring patterns of behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, when patients mention their imminent death from cancer, clinicians may unwittingly avoid discussing this subject. The clinician may be cognizant of feeling tense and anxious, but otherwise not recognize other feelings and thoughts, such as personal fear of death, fear of discussing &ldquo;unpleasant&rdquo; topics, and uncertainty about what to do.</p><p>The following section discusses some particular common psychological factors and how physicians should respond when these factors adversely affect a general medical condition.

Generic interventions can seem superficial and artificial, and at worst miss the mark entirely. As an example, if the physician wrongly presumes to know why a patient is depressed without asking, the patient is likely to feel misunderstood. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2748540\"><span class=\"h2\">Regression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When regression is excessive (eg, creates invalidism), clinicians often become impatient and angry.

One should not presume to know why patients are anxious without asking.</p><p>Knowing a patient&rsquo;s fears can lead to appropriate interventions such as cognitive therapy or education, which target unrealistic fears. As an example, patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction may be frightened of having sex; discussions in which clinicians are careful to respect the patient&rsquo;s privacy can reduce the fear by reassurance that normal intercourse does not entail excessive cardiac demand. In addition, fear of pain can be addressed by explaining anticipated pain management strategies, and fear of losing abilities may be managed through plans for rehabilitation. </p><p>When clarifying the patient&rsquo;s anxieties and intervening with psychotherapy does not allay anxiety sufficiently, the short-term use of benzodiazepines may be helpful, but pharmacotherapy is no substitute for targeted reassurance and support.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2748580\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression in the context of PFAOMC refers to subsyndromal symptoms such as dysphoria, rather than a full syndrome or mental disorder (eg, unipolar major depression). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis#H122874\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Depression'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients are helpless in confronting their general medical illness; one can enhance their sense of control by encouraging expression of preferences about health care, giving inpatients more control over the hospital and nursing routines, and emphasizing active participation in treatment, rather than just passively accepting prescribed care. Patients who are demoralized by the prospect of major treatment (eg, transplantation, amputation, dialysis, chemotherapy, or colostomy) can benefit from speaking with others who have successfully gone through the same procedure. </p><p>Pharmacotherapy is generally not indicated for treating sadness or other depressive mood states (eg, emptiness, hopelessness, or irritability), in the absence of a syndrome such as major depression. Additional information about managing minor (subsyndromal) depression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-minor-depression-in-adults-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar minor depression in adults: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2748610\"><span class=\"h2\">Denial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of denial depends upon the clinical judgement that it is maladaptive (eg, refusing critical treatment or threatening to leave against medical advice) and needs to be modified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis#H122880\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Denial'</a>.) </p><p>Interventions for excessive denial are directed at the feelings (eg, fear and anxiety) that underlie the denial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Directly challenging the patient&rsquo;s claims or trying to scare the patient into cooperating is typically avoided because it is not beneficial; confrontation can exacerbate the underlying fear, and intensify the denial and impulse to flight (leave against medical advice). Empathy and expressing concern for the patient is more productive, while simultaneously maximizing the patient&rsquo;s sense of control. Psychotherapy can also allay negative emotions. If interpersonal relationships are reinforcing denial, these should be addressed as well. Involving helpful family members may convince patients that accepting medical care is in their best interest.</p><p>For patients with denial that does not interfere with treatment or lead to endangerment, we suggest leaving it alone rather than directly confronting it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Physicians are obligated to inform patients about the illness and treatment; following that, if the patient accepts treatment but manifests an irrationally optimistic outlook, physicians should respect the patient&rsquo;s need to cope by denying the prognosis. </p><p>Denial in some patients is fragile, and physicians must judge whether the patient is better served by forgoing the denial and instead discussing their fears with their physician. Denial should never be instilled by giving patients false hope (eg, by deliberate omission of information), which is different from the support of hope and optimism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2748670\"><span class=\"h2\">Anger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The temptation is to spend less time with angry patients, but spending extra time is indicated. Avoid becoming defensive and counterattacking, respond calmly with facts, and treat patients with respect while attempting to understand why they are angry and how it is adversely affecting their health or interfering in their care. For patients who are justifiably angry (eg, waiting an hour to see the doctor), apologies and explanations for the problem that precipitated the patient&rsquo;s anger should be forthcoming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, patients can be told about the link between chronic anger and adverse effects on health (eg, blood pressure and cardiac function), and the benefits of better anger management. Referral for stress management may be helpful as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2748690\"><span class=\"h1\">NONADHERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adherence to pharmacotherapy involves taking medication as prescribed with regard to dose, frequency, and timing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Adherence (compliance) can be quantified on a continuum as a percentage of doses taken as prescribed during a specific interval, or expressed categorically (eg, good, partial, and poor adherence). For many illnesses, common but arbitrary cutoffs for good compliance are taking at least 70 or 80 percent of prescribed doses. Adherence within patients can change over time and vary between different drugs. </p><p>The first step in managing poor adherence is to determine why the patient is nonadherent; the reasons for noncompliance influence the interventions that are selected. Multiple studies have found that psychological factors are associated with poor adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, nonadherence takes many forms, and it is important to distinguish patients who are noncompliant because of psychological problems from patients who are willing to take their medications but do not do so because they forget, misunderstand instructions, or are misinformed about pharmacotherapy (eg, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get addicted&rdquo;). Other causes of noncompliance include adverse effects, complex treatment regimens, inadequate follow-up, asymptomatic disease states, poor relationship between clinicians and patients, as well as financial problems.</p><p>Psychological factors that may disrupt compliance include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stigma, shame, or humiliation regarding the general medical illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helplessness (depression) regarding the illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mistrusting clinicians</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anger with clinicians or illness</p><p/><p>It is worth determining how patients understand their illness (eg, asking &ldquo;What do you think causes heart attacks?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How does it affect you?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Can it be controlled?&rdquo;), and exploring patients&rsquo; attitudes and expectations of treatment. Patients may believe that they are not ill or that the illness is not severe. In addition, it is helpful to know whether patients think they are at risk for consequences of the disease. Patients who understand the personal consequences may better absorb general information about the illness.</p><p>It is important to ask about adherence in a nonjudgmental manner (eg, &ldquo;It must be hard to take all of your pills. How often does this happen?&rdquo;), and to not scold patients when they acknowledge nonadherence, to foster open communication about the problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Patients who are prescribed maintenance pharmacotherapy are likely to be nonadherent at some point. Clinicians should adopt a long-term perspective and try to use episodes of nonadherence as a learning tool for patients. </p><p>Three prerequisites for patient adherence to pharmacotherapy are that the regimen should be [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acceptable &ndash; Patients are more likely to accept pharmacotherapy if they can acknowledge their illness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understandable &ndash; Does the patient understand the rationale for the drug regimen? It may be helpful to have patients repeat in their own words how they understand the illness and treatment options</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manageable &ndash; Practical issues often affect adherence</p><p/><p>The medication regimen should be simplified by minimizing the number of drugs and the times per day they need to be taken. A review of 76 observational studies found that adherence declines as the number of medications increases, such that adherence with one dose per day was approximately 80 percent and with four doses per day was 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. When complex regimens are necessary, physicians should help patients determine which aspects of treatment are most important. It may also help when possible to implement a complex regimen gradually, adding one drug at a time, and to tailor dosing schedules to the patient&rsquo;s lifestyle. </p><p>Techniques that can improve medication adherence include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/2,6,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,9-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask about prior use of pharmacotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss with patients their expectations of benefits and adverse effects, how the clinician will monitor the use and benefit of medications, the clinician&rsquo;s availability for questions about treatment, and plans for dose titrations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elicit and emphasize benefits that are important to the patient (see <a href=\"#H2748922\" class=\"local\">'Negative expectations'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elicit and address irrational or erroneous beliefs about medications, negative attitudes towards pharmacotherapy (eg, &ldquo;Drugs are useless,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of taking medications,&rdquo; or &ldquo;They remind me that I&rsquo;m sick&rdquo;), and the desire to manage the illness without medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incorporating patient preferences, which may be based on realistic factors (eg, differing side effect profiles) or less objective beliefs (eg, requesting the drug that successfully treated the patient&rsquo;s friend). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide simple and clear written instructions for taking prescribed medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggest pill boxes to organize daily doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggest the use of cues as a reminder to take medications; options include smart phone alarms, a written record, or pairing pill taking with another regular activity such as eating breakfast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask about the patient&rsquo;s ability to follow the regimen and address barriers to adherence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involve family members.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss the need to maintain pharmacotherapy despite feeling better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reinforce desirable behavior and results.</p><p/><p>In addition, randomized trials suggest that specific interventions can improve adherence to pharmacotherapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A six-month trial (n &gt;500 patients with hypertension) compared usual care alone with usual care plus a pharmacist intervention that included collaborative care, medication review, and tailored adherence counseling with motivational interviewing and telephone calls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychological-factors-affecting-other-medical-conditions-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

It is incumbent upon physicians to maximize patients&rsquo; health and important to inform patients of the consequences of not following recommendations. However, therapeutic perfectionism fails to recognize that for a particular patient, other values may outweigh some aims of treatment.

It is worth determining how patients understand their illness and important to ask about adherence in a nonjudgmental manner. The medication regimen should be acceptable, understandable, and manageable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Techniques that can improve medication adherence include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Emphasizing benefits that are important to the patient</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Addressing erroneous beliefs about and negative attitudes towards medications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Providing simple and clear written instructions for taking prescribed medications </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suggesting pill boxes to organize daily doses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suggesting the use of cues as a reminder to take medications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Involving family members </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Discussing the need to maintain pharmacotherapy despite feeling better</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Trying to improve adherence by frightening, scolding, shaming, or threatening patients is rarely successful. In addition, physicians should exercise restraint in pursuing therapeutic goals and compromise with patients who want some control of their treatment.
