Reducing the rate of severe late toxicity and its burden upon survivors is increasingly important in this era of improved cure rates and prolonged survival following definitive RT.

Thus, routine neck dissection imposes excess morbidity on these patients, and careful observation is the preferred approach for patients achieving a complete nodal response. If a complete response is achieved, the rate of isolated nodal failures remains low, regardless of initial nodal size, even though larger nodes are generally less likely to achieve a complete response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-neck-following-definitive-radiotherapy-with-or-without-chemoradiotherapy-in-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Older criteria used to select patients for neck dissection included routine post-therapy neck dissection regardless of neck response for those with pretreatment disease &gt;N1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110640\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110640 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110641 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110659\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110659 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110628\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110628 \">table 4</a>), for those who achieved less than a complete response (residuum &gt;1 cm) in the neck, and for all those with N3 disease regardless of neck response.

Patients with HPV associated HNSCC tend to be younger, are former or never smokers, have smaller primaries with intermediate to advanced nodal metastasis, and have a significantly better prognosis.

Ultrasound is the cheapest and least invasive modality, and it can provide information on nodal size, architecture, and blood flow. Dense, fibrotic, and avascular lymph nodes on ultrasound imaging in general do not contain residual tumor.</p><p>Typically, the initial restaging scan should be performed around 12 weeks post-therapy, assuming that there is ongoing clinical response.

For patients who had PET equivocal nodal findings at 12 weeks, a repeat PET was performed four to six weeks later to improve the accuracy of the PET.

In a study by the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG 98.02), patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">N2/3</span> disease who achieved a complete response at the primary site following RT were assessed radiologically at 12 weeks. For patients with residual CT nodal abnormalities at 12 weeks and a negative PET, observation was continued and a repeat CT scan performed at 26 weeks. There were no isolated nodal failures in patients who ultimately achieved a complete radiologic response in the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-neck-following-definitive-radiotherapy-with-or-without-chemoradiotherapy-in-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, in another study of 98 patients, the use of PET in addition to CT at eight weeks after treatment provided minimal additional information beyond that from the CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-neck-following-definitive-radiotherapy-with-or-without-chemoradiotherapy-in-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a preliminary report of the PET PREVENT study, the 8 to 10 week PET did not add to the benefit of conventional CT assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-neck-following-definitive-radiotherapy-with-or-without-chemoradiotherapy-in-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. PET was found to have poor correlation with the post-therapy histopathologic findings in those who underwent a neck dissection.</p><p/><p>In addition, investigators have examined the role of standardized uptake values (SUV) to predict response to therapy. With maximum SUV cut-off values of 2.5 to 3, there are reports of high sensitivity and specificity for residual nodal disease. However, there are a number of factors, such as the presence of necrosis and other physiological variations, which can make interpretation difficult. Hence, treatment response assessment should continue to be made on the basis of the clinical context and qualitative parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-neck-following-definitive-radiotherapy-with-or-without-chemoradiotherapy-in-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11097729\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of long-term surveillance following the decision to either observe or perform a neck dissection around 10 to 12 weeks post-therapy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early detection of locoregional recurrence, which may be amendable to curative salvage surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of second primary cancers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of late effects</p><p/><p>The majority of recurrences in the primary site <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neck occur in the first three years following treatment and less frequently beyond that, up to five years.

Key factors include improvements in treatment, advances in imaging, and epidemiologic changes in HNSCC. Routine consolidation neck dissection to remove nodes originally involved has been replaced by observation in patients who achieve a complete response in the primary tumor and cervical lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"#H1213025042\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F-18-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) has added functional imaging to the previously utilized structural techniques (computed tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">[CT]/magnetic</span> resonance imaging [MRI]). A negative PET has a high negative predictive value, and a negative PET is an important indicator that disease is not present and is associated with a low incidence of isolated neck recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H1213025260\" class=\"local\">'Functional imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11097687\" class=\"local\">'Management of a residual node'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The results of clinical evaluation, structural imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">(CT/MRI),</span> and functional imaging (PET) are complementary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97278\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97278 \">algorithm 1</a>). This information can be used to identify populations that are at low risk for isolated neck recurrence and, hence, can be observed without further treatment, as well as those patients who should undergo neck dissection.

RT is highly effective for sterilizing subclinical disease in the neck, and posttreatment neck dissection only focuses on the areas suspected of harboring residual disease.
