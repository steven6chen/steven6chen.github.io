This topic will review the indications for trachelectomy after supracervical hysterectomy, as well as techniques and possible complications. Radical trachelectomy performed as fertility sparing surgery in women with early stage cervical cancer is discussed separately.

It may also be performed in conjunction with other pelvic surgery (eg, oophorectomy, bowel resection). After supracervical hysterectomy, new cervical symptoms will develop in up to one-quarter of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachelectomy-following-supracervical-hysterectomy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>In the largest series of trachelectomy from a single institution (n = 310 cases from 1974 to 2003), the most common indications were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachelectomy-following-supracervical-hysterectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolapse (52 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic mass (25 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal cervical cytology (12 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding (9 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic pain (7 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-cervical cancer (6 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspareunia (3 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other (7 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple indications (18 percent)</p><p/><p>The mean duration of time between supracervical hysterectomy and trachelectomy was 21 years when the indication for trachelectomy was cervical cancer and 31 years when the indication was prolapse.

The open approach is reserved for women who may not tolerate the steep Trendelenburg position required for laparoscopic or robot-assisted procedures, such as those with cardiac hypertrophy or ischemia, abdominal distension, increased intracranial pressure, ongoing infusions for neuraxial anesthesia, recent eye surgery, or gastric reflux or aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachelectomy-following-supracervical-hysterectomy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>For women who do not require abdominal or pelvic exploration, we perform trachelectomy vaginally because of its lower morbidity and faster recovery compared with the abdominal approach (see <a href=\"#H30187340\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trachelectomy-following-supracervical-hysterectomy/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>].<sup> </sup>In women with cervicovaginal prolapse, uterosacral ligament suspension (such as McCall's culdoplasty) and repair of the anterior and posterior vaginal compartments are also performed, as needed.

Concomitant culdoplasty, anterior repairs, and posterior repairs can then be performed, if applicable. In patients who present with cervicovaginal prolapse, our preferred primary approach is a native tissue repair such as the modified McCall procedure, with high plication of the uterosacral ligaments to support the vaginal apex.

The robotic system was designed to overcome many of the challenges of conventional laparoscopy.

Prolapse, pain, cyclical bleeding, abnormal cervical cytology, and cervical abnormalities, such as hypertrophy, are common indications. (See <a href=\"#H30187296\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal surgical approach depends on the specific indications for trachelectomy, the need for concomitant procedures, and the presence of comorbidities. An abdominal approach (laparoscopic, robotic, or open) is indicated when thorough abdominal exploration is necessary and surgical resection of abdominal or pelvic disease may be required. If there are no specific indications for an abdominal approach, we perform trachelectomy vaginally because of its lower morbidity and faster recovery. (See <a href=\"#H30187296\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing vaginal trachelectomy, we routinely perform McCall's suture plication of the uterosacral ligaments to the midportion and corners of the vaginal cuff to prevent future prolapse of the vaginal apex.
