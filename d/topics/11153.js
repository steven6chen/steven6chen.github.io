While specific changes in cognition are frequently observed in normal aging, there is increasing evidence that some forms of cognitive impairment are recognizable as an early manifestation of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The utility of this paradigm centers around the recognition that there is a continuum of cognition between aging and dementia, and dementia represents a rather advanced state of cognitive impairment. A better understanding of transitional states between normal cognition and dementia will improve the understanding of cognitive decline, facilitate early diagnosis, offer an opportunity for intervention, and ultimately benefit patients. It should be noted that MCI is a syndrome much like dementia is a syndrome and, as such, may not always reflect an early manifestation of Alzheimer disease (AD). Nevertheless, MCI due to AD is the most common type of MCI.</p><p>MCI is diagnosed clinically by the presence of a cognitive decline, either by history or serial evaluations; objective impairment in one or more cognitive domains; and relative preservation of functional activities without dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. If impairment involves memory, it is known as amnestic MCI (aMCI), and if not, nonamnestic MCI (naMCI).</p><p>This topic will review the prognosis and treatment of MCI. The epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment of MCI and topics related to dementia, including diagnosis, treatment, risk factors, and prevention of dementia, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGRESSION TO DEMENTIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older adults with MCI are at increased risk for progressing to dementia. Across multiple studies, those with MCI are approximately three times more likely to develop dementia over the next two to five years compared with age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, a certain percentage of patients with MCI improve, even to normal, over a one- to three-year follow-up time, if a treatable cause of the MCI is identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. The proportion who do ranges from 14 to 56 percent across various studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This finding emphasizes the clinical heterogeneity of MCI. However, such patients remain at significantly increased risk for a future diagnosis of dementia compared with those who have never received a diagnosis of MCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In spite of short-term clinical instability of the diagnosis, the vast majority of persons once labeled with MCI will progress to dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Part of the variability between studies is due to the different populations studied, for example, patients referred to memory clinics versus epidemiologic cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Rates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When counseling patients diagnosed with MCI that is suspected to be of neurodegenerative origin, we estimate the risk of progression to dementia to be 10 percent per year, or 15 percent over two years, in adults age 65 years and older; this number tends to be slightly lower in epidemiologic samples and slightly higher in clinical samples.</p><p>The overall incidence rate of dementia in the general older adult population is estimated at 1 to 3 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/7,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14,15</a>]. By contrast, reported annual rates of progression from MCI to dementia have ranged from 5 to 16 percent, with lower rates of progression observed in population-based studies and higher rates in clinical centers and some treatment trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/6-8,14-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,14-25</a>]. Rates of conversion also vary according to the duration of follow-up; one analysis compared longer-duration (&gt;5 years) with shorter-duration studies and found lower rates with longer durations of follow-up, suggesting that the risk of conversion decreases over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In this study, the cumulative incidence was 33 percent. Typically, patients convert within a period of two to three years; however, longer intervals of up to eight years have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the heterogeneity of outcomes among individuals with MCI, many studies have investigated factors that might identify those with MCI who will develop dementia. Combinations of risk factors may be more predictive than individual risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A formula for predicting MCI in the general population has been described, indicating that certain factors such as age, education, sex, medical comorbidities, mental status testing, indices of depression and anxiety, and gait speed can suggest progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Risk factors for dementia in the general population are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some studies suggest that socioeconomic variables may be predictors. Gender and education level are not predictors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/25,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging is a primary predictor of progression of MCI to AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/6,22,31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22,31-35</a>]. With every year of age increase, MCI is slightly more likely to convert to AD. MCI is relatively unlikely to represent a predementia condition in patients less than 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], unless there is a family history of early-onset dementia associated with an autosomal dominant mutation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2116473307\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuropsychological testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of observational studies suggest that neuropsychological testing is helpful in defining individuals with MCI who are at risk for dementia. Patients who meet MCI criteria according to neuropsychological test performance have a higher rate of conversion to dementia than those who have a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale summary score of 0.5 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53706\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53706 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>More severely affected patients (with greater deficits <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a broader range of deficits) have been shown to be at greater risk for dementia than those who are less affected, according to prospective cohort studies of patients with MCI or &quot;cognitive impairment, no dementia&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/8,37-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,37-43</a>]. Deficits that include a primary or prominent amnestic component as well as those that lead to slight impairment in activities of daily living are also felt to identify patients at higher risk of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, patients with subjective memory complaints who appear unimpaired on neuropsychological testing appear to be at higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia than patients without such complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-49</a>]. </p><p>A number of specific test measures, such as delayed verbal recall, visual recognition memory, and other cued memory tasks, as well as measures of instrumental activities of daily living, have also been found to have high predictive value for dementia in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/28,33,38,50-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,33,38,50-58</a>]. However, these have not been independently and prospectively validated in a manner that allows application to individual cases.</p><p>Follow-up neuropsychological testing may provide more helpful information regarding prognosis, in that intraindividual change in cognitive function is more sensitive than comparison with group norms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In one cohort study, acceleration of cognitive decline occurred approximately three years prior to the diagnosis of AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Educational level was an important modulator of test performance and rate of decline. These findings have been corroborated in other cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/39,41,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41,60,61</a>]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of specific patterns of decline have not been rigorously evaluated. Practice effects, which can lead to test score improvement in normal older adults even after an interval of one to two years, may decrease the sensitivity of neuropsychological test decline as a predictor of AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Practice effects can be seen in normal subjects, but they tend to be short lived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychological features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuropsychiatric symptoms are prevalent in individuals with MCI.

Other studies have suggested that apathy, anxiety, and dysphoria may be harbingers of incipient MCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15748099\"><span class=\"h3\">Slow gait</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined with cognitive complaints, gait slowing may identify individuals at higher risk of MCI and future dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. Some have proposed calling this state the motoric cognitive risk (MCR) syndrome, defined as the presence of cognitive complaints and slow gait in older individuals without dementia or mobility disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>In a study that pooled data from four prospective cohort studies totalling 4812 individuals without baseline dementia, MCR was associated with a twofold increased risk of both incident cognitive impairment and dementia over a mean follow-up time ranging from five to nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Slow gait was defined as a walking speed &ge;1 standard deviation below age- and sex-specific means on a timed-walk test over a fixed distance. Forty percent of individuals with MCR also met criteria for MCI, and both MCR and MCI predicted incident cognitive impairment when examined in the same multivariate model (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] 1.63 and 1.36, respectively). While MCR was associated with the AD dementia subtype in two of the four cohorts in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], it has been associated with vascular dementia in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Across 22 cohorts worldwide, the pooled prevalence of MCR among older adults is 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1779217352\"><span class=\"h3\">Olfactory dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Olfactory dysfunction has also been identified as a predictor of subsequent AD dementia, both in older individuals with normal cognition and in those with MCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/77-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-82</a>]. One study used the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), a scratch-and-sniff card containing six food- and six nonfood-related smells, to assess olfactory function in a population-based cohort of older adults aged 70 to 89 years with normal baseline cognition (n = 1430) or MCI (n = 221) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Over a median follow-up time of three years, patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) in the lowest quartile of olfactory function (B-SIT scores 0 to 5) had fivefold higher risk of progression to AD dementia compared with those in the highest quartile (B-SIT scores 10 to 12). Among individuals with normal cognition at baseline, B-SIT scores in the lowest quartile conferred a twofold higher risk of aMCI and no additional risk for naMCI.

In one study of 837 patients with MCI, the presence of any one vascular risk factor (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, cerebrovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia) was associated with an increased risk of conversion to dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Another prospective study found that the risk of progression from MCI to dementia was increased in patients with the metabolic syndrome (HR 4.25) as well as diabetes (HR 2.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Other studies have not found a significant association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].</p><p>Evidence of cerebrovascular disease on MRI has also been associated with a higher risk of conversion to dementia.

A number of smaller studies have examined the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers for predicting conversion from MCI to dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/28,52,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,52,94</a>]. The most replicated CSF biomarkers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased levels of tau or tau protein phosphorylated at Thr 181 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/21,34,95-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,34,95-103</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower levels of amyloid beta 42 (A&szlig;42) peptide, a low ratio of A&szlig;42 to A&szlig;40 levels, and a low ratio of A&szlig;42 to tau levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/21,98-100,102,104-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,98-100,102,104-114</a>]</p><p/><p>The finding of decreased A&szlig;42 is felt to reflect the accelerated deposition of amyloid protein in brain tissues, and elevated tau and phosphorylated tau are considered to be an expression of neurofibrillary tangles. These pathologic changes and a low ratio of A&szlig;42 to tau levels are seen in AD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97451 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>In a prospective cohort study, a low ratio of A&szlig;42 to tau levels was found in over 30 percent of healthy volunteers, greater than 50 percent of those with subjective reports of memory problems but cognitively normal, and nearly 70 and 80 percent for naMCI and aMCI subjects, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. This profile was associated with cognitive decline in both MCI groups and was predictive of future AD in patients with aMCI. One longitudinal study of patients with varying degrees of cognitive impairment (normal, MCI, AD) found that decreased levels of A&szlig;42 appeared to be an early marker of disease, appearing before clinical cognitive loss and neuroimaging abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Another study found that while MRI findings were superior to CSF markers in predicting future decline, predictive ability was further improved when the tests were combined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>].</p><p>In a longitudinal study of cognitively normal subjects, the presence of abnormal CSF A&szlig;42 was associated with an 11 percent risk of progression to a CDR of 0.5 (similar to MCI), whereas the presence of both abnormal CSF A&szlig;42 and CSF tau was associated with a 56 percent risk of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. Therefore, the closer the profile of CSF biomarkers is to that of AD, the more likely the risk for further cognitive decline.</p><p>The applicability of these findings to the general population is unclear, however, and these tests do not have an established role in the evaluation of patients with MCI in the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A 2014 meta-analysis of 14 observational studies evaluating CSF A&szlig;42 as a tool for predicting conversion from MCI to AD found significant variation in assay thresholds, which precluded summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. Sensitivity in individual studies ranged from 36 to 100 percent and specificity ranged from 29 to 91 percent. The authors concluded that a low CSF A&szlig;42 is of marginal clinical utility. In addition to concerns about low predictive value, a multicenter study found that assays for CSF markers can vary, suggesting a need for better standardization of the assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. The absence of a clinical treatment imperative for MCI makes this relatively invasive test less appealing at this point in time. New CSF analytical platforms are being developed to standardize the measurements of key analytes for predicting conversion from MCI due to AD to dementia due to AD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasma biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ongoing investigations have focused on biomarkers in the serum or plasma that correlate with AD and other neurodegenerative dementias. An analysis of 120 signaling proteins in blood plasma found 18 that could be used to classify healthy controls from patients with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/118-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">118-120</a>]. These were then studied in a series of 47 patients with MCI; these proteins identified 20 of 22 patients who developed clinical AD and none of the eight patients who developed non-AD dementia.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

A conservative estimate of the risk is 10 percent per year. Many, but not all, patients will progress to dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Progression to dementia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropsychological test measures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuroimaging studies are being evaluated as predictive tools for assessing patients' risk for conversion to dementia. These lack standardization, and there is no clinical imperative for general use. Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (<em>APOE</em> &epsilon;4) genotype testing is also not recommended as a way to predict likelihood of progression. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Predictors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with MCI should be evaluated and treated for reversible causes of cognitive impairment, including medication side effects, sleep disturbances, depression, vitamin B12 deficiency, and hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H1718004525\" class=\"local\">'Treat reversible causes of cognitive impairment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with MCI and clinical or radiologic evidence of cerebrovascular pathology should be screened and treated for vascular risk factors. This approach has not been shown to alter conversion to dementia; however, there is convincing benefit for reduction of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events. (See <a href=\"#H676156846\" class=\"local\">'Vascular risk factor modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular exercise might have cognitive benefits in patients with MCI and is encouraged in older adults for general health benefits. (See <a href=\"#H1716303989\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based on the available clinical trial data and lack of convincing benefit, we recommend <strong>not</strong> routinely treating MCI with cholinesterase inhibitors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For an individual patient with troublesome memory difficulties, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">donepezil</a> for symptomatic benefit may be warranted, although controlled study support for this recommendation is not available. Patients and families should be informed of the potential risks.
