(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Indications for revascularization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, a substantial proportion of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery do not achieve complete revascularization and, despite maximal medical therapy, many of these patients continue to experience residual anginal symptoms or myocardial ischemia requiring hospitalization. The outcome with medical therapy is poor and one study of 59 such patients found that the one-year rate of myocardial infarction or death was 25.5 and 17 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There are several novel therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated for treating patients with refractory angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 2002, a report from the European Society of Cardiology reviewed these strategies, including transmyocardial and percutaneous laser revascularization, and summarized the strength of the evidence supporting their use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61088\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61088 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The role of transmyocardial laser revascularization will be found here. Other modalities, including medical therapies such as antagonism of endothelin-1 and chelation, and invasive modalities such as promotion of angiogenesis, spinal chord stimulation, and external balloon counterpulsation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic angiogenesis for management of refractory angina&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New therapies for angina pectoris&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TMLR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR) is a technique that uses laser ablation to create transmural channels in the ischemic myocardium in order to restore myocardial perfusion. It shows promise in patients who have angina that is refractory to medical therapy and who are not candidates for surgery or angioplasty. It has also been used as an adjunctive therapy with minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery to achieve more complete revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Animal studies have shown that TMLR reduces infarct size and preserves myocardial function after an infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Off-pump and minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Outcomes&quot;</a>.) However, despite United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of some of the laser devices for treatment of intractable angina, these techniques are in the early stages of their development; while they offer much promise, there is substantial risk associated with their use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic premise behind the application of TMLR is based upon the work of early investigators who were seeking to emulate reptilian circulation in the mammalian heart by creating direct conduits for blood flow from the left ventricular cavity into the myocardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68481\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68481 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A variety of techniques, including needle acupuncture, mechanical drilling of the left ventricular conduits, and insertion of T-tubes into the myocardium, were attempted with variable success. Development of the clinical high power CO2, holmium:yttrium-aluminum garnet, and excimer laser systems led to FDA approval of laser myocardial revascularization as a stand-alone therapy in patients with intractable angina. This decision was based upon the demonstration of significant reduction in anginal symptoms as assessed by angina class scale and improvement in exercise capacity. However, there has been little objective evidence of improvements in myocardial perfusion as assessed by nuclear perfusion imaging.</p><p>Further studies in large animal models have shown that the original premise of TMLR, passive myocardial perfusion of oxygenated blood via newly created channels, is almost certainly <strong>false</strong>. Essentially, all channels are closed by 24 hours, possibly within the first hour, and direct measurement of channel-supplied myocardial blood flow suggests that the increase in myocardial blood flow is minuscule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The lack of improved blood flow has also been observed clinically. As an example, one study performed positron emission tomography prior to and at 7.5 and 34.6 weeks after TMLR in seven patients; despite a reduction in angina, there was no change in myocardial blood flow at rest and during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> infusion or in coronary vasodilator reserve in lasered and unlasered regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, the mechanism of the observed clinical benefit, ie, reduction in symptom intensity, following TMLR remains uncertain. A number of possibilities have been proposed to explain these results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial angiogenesis resulting from the upregulation and release of vascular endothelial growth factors and inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial sympathetic denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/6,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial fibrosis that results in a tethering action to improve myocardial function and promote favorable remodeling.</p><p/><p>Regardless of the mechanism, there is usually a delay in clinical benefit; improvement in anginal class is often not evident for at least three months postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This situation places patients at high risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several clinical trials have reported encouraging results following TMLR in patients with refractory angina who had lesions not amenable to revascularization or who were at high risk for revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-23</a>]. The following reports illustrate the major findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial involved 192 patients with refractory angina and left ventricular free-wall ischemia that was not amenable to direct coronary revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. After a one-year follow-up, more patients undergoing TMLR improved by at least two Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classes (72 versus 13 percent for continued medical therapy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 2</a>) and more had a significant improvement in quality of life. Myocardial perfusion, as assessed by thallium scanning, improved by 20 percent in the TMLR group compared to a 27 percent worsening in the medical group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79231\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79231 \">figure 2</a>). Overall survival at one year was the same in the two groups (85 versus 79 percent) but there was a marked reduction in hospitalization for unstable angina with TMLR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79521\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79521 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a trial of 275 patients with refractory angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

There was no difference in myocardial perfusion with thallium imaging or in one-year survival (84 versus 89 percent).</p><p/><p>At five years, patients treated with TMLR continued to have more frequent improvement in angina than those treated medically (88 versus 44 percent improved by two or more angina classes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

There were no differences in the number of myocardial infarctions or mortality (22 versus 24 percent).</p><p/><p>These benefits have not been confirmed in all trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. One trial randomly assigned 188 patients with refractory angina due to severe coronary disease not amenable to revascularization with TMLR plus usual medication or to medical management only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The perioperative mortality was 5 percent. After a one-year follow-up, patients who underwent TMLR had better relief of angina than the medically treated patients, but there was no difference in exercise capacity as assessed with treadmill exercise testing and a nonsignificant trend toward reduced survival (89 versus 96 percent in the medically treated patients).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A limitation to these observations is that the surgical trials were not blinded, thereby permitting a possible placebo effect. The DIRECT trial, which is the only major <strong>blinded</strong> study of laser myocardial revascularization, failed to show any benefit compared to continued medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Risk factors for an adverse event include CCS class IV status, unprotected left main stenosis, and diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The reported perioperative mortality has ranged from 3 to 5 percent in most reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/16,25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25,29</a>], but rates as high as 12 percent have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30</a>]. As noted above, however, the increase in short-term mortality does not appear to result in reduced survival at follow-up at one to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/16,17,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,23,25</a>].</p><p>The perioperative mortality may be related to acute adverse effects of TMLR on the myocardium that might lead to reduced myocardial blood flow, regional ischemia, and diastolic dysfunction, a result of an increase in regional myocardial edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, the risk of both perioperative and long-term mortality may be reduced in patients with good blood flow to at least one region of the heart through a native artery or a patent vascular graft (5 versus 25 percent postoperative mortality in patients who did not have adequate blood flow to any region, a benefit that persisted at one year) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56163\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56163 \">figure 6</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Use in refractory unstable angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with unstable angina that is refractory to medical therapy are at high risk for myocardial infarction and death. Although such patients are usually referred for revascularization by either angioplasty or bypass surgery, there are patients in whom revascularization is not feasible, including those with failed prior procedures, diffuse coronary artery disease, distal stenosis, or small coronary arteries.

The intensive care unit and hospital stay after TMLR was the same in both groups. Although perioperative mortality (&le;30 days post-TMLR) was higher in the unstable angina group (16 versus 3 percent), the late mortality (up to one year after TMLR) was the same (13 versus 11 percent). Among the survivors, 82 percent had a reduction of angina by two or more classes at one year, which was similar to the outcome in patients with chronic stable angina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined TMLR and CABG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety and efficacy of TMLR combined with coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with coronary disease not amenable to complete revascularization with bypass surgery was evaluated in a study of 263 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to bypass grafting of suitable vessels plus TMLR of areas not graftable or bypass surgery alone, with nongraftable areas left unrevascularized.</p><p>The operative mortality was lower with the combined approach (1.5 versus 7.6 percent for bypass surgery alone) and the need for inotropic support or use of an intra-aortic balloon pump was less after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transmyocardial-laser-revascularization-for-management-of-refractory-angina/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
