The availability of factor replacement products has dramatically improved care for individuals with these conditions. However, patients do present with acute bleeding symptoms that require rapid treatment, and planning is required for patients undergoing surgery or invasive procedures.</p><p>This topic review discusses the treatment of bleeding and perioperative management for individuals with hemophilia A and B.

For patients with potentially serious or life-threatening bleeding, it is important to initiate treatment <strong>immediately</strong>, even before the diagnostic assessment is completed. Stated another way: treat first, evaluate second, plan further therapy after weighing all relevant issues.</p><p>Serious or life-threatening bleeding includes any of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding in the central nervous system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding in the hip</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep muscle bleeding with neurovascular compromise or the potential for neurovascular complications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intra-abdominal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding that could affect the airway (eg, into the throat or neck)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding severe enough to result in anemia and potentially require red blood cell transfusion(s)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged bleeding that is not adequately responding to home-based therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iliopsoas bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant injuries such as motor vehicle accidents or falls from distances of several feet or more</p><p/><p>An acutely hemorrhaging hemophilic patient should be transported to a facility equipped to handle the event that has the appropriate replacement products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Guidelines from the United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organization (UKHCDO) suggest that the maximum time between arrival to the hospital and clinical assessment should not exceed 15 minutes, and if treatment for bleeding is required, the maximum time to its delivery should not exceed 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. If the patient has the appropriate replacement therapy at home, this product may be administered before leaving or on route to the facility, as long as the bleeding is not life-threatening and this does not result in delays. In life-threatening circumstances, emergency medical transport should be called and the products should be administered on-route.</p><p>As noted above, factor administration should not be delayed while awaiting imaging studies in a patient with a concerning injury or suspected central nervous system bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>]. All significant head injuries must be considered nontrivial unless proven otherwise by observation and imaging (eg, with computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). If there is doubt about the seriousness of bleeding, it is preferable to treat the patient as if the bleeding is serious (ie, &quot;if in doubt, treat&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]). Further, the importance of urgently giving the factor infusion outweighs considerations of the specific factor preparation (ie, &quot;give the appropriate product that is available rather than spending time trying to obtain a different product&quot;).</p><p>Other hemostatic therapies for individuals with inhibitors or those whose bleeding is not controlled by factor infusion are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H24022363\" class=\"local\">'Therapies other than factor replacement'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1074013365\"><span class=\"h3\">Factor dosing for severe bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For severe bleeding, the factor activity level should be maintained <strong>above 50 percent at all times</strong>. An immediate dose of factor should be given to raise the peak factor level to 80 to 100 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110820 \">table 1</a>), and additional doses should be timed to occur when a factor activity level of approximately 50 percent is achieved, so the patient's circulating factor level does not drop below 50 percent. Another option is to give a dose of factor to raise the level to 80 to 100 percent, followed by continuous infusion to maintain a consistent hemostatic level. As noted above, administration of factor should not be delayed while awaiting imaging studies. (See <a href=\"#H4101198789\" class=\"local\">'Initial considerations for severe bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p>The following illustrates a typical calculation of factor dosing, but this should not substitute for the clinical judgement of the treating clinician, information from previous bleeding events for that patient, labeling information for specific products, consultation with the hemophilia treatment center (HTC), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> institutional protocols that take into account local practices.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemophilia A (deficiency of factor VIII [factor 8])</strong> &ndash; <strong>Give an initial dose of factor VIII of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</strong></span> to raise the factor VIII level to 100 percent. This calculation assumes a starting factor VIII activity level close to 0 percent, a desired factor activity level of 100 percent, and a volume of distribution of approximately 0.5.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dose equals the patient's weight (in kg) multiplied by the desired rise in factor VIII level (as a whole number, such that a desired level of 100 percent is entered as 100) multiplied by the volume of distribution (for factor VIII, this equals 0.5). As an example, for a 60 kg patient who requires an increase to 100 percent, the dose would be 60 kg x 100 x 0.5 = 3000 units of factor VIII.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The second and subsequent doses are given at intervals of approximately one half-life of the infused product for that patient, which is based on peak and trough levels as described below. A typical half-life for standard half-life factor VIII products is approximately 8 to 12 hours. Approximate half-lives for longer-lasting factor VIII products range from 10 to 20 hours. Approximate half-lives for specific products are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109838 \">table 2</a>). These doses will be approximately half the initial dose, and will be guided by the patient's measured factor level and the desired peak level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another option is to give the initial factor VIII bolus followed by a continuous infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

This method offers the advantage of consistent levels, less frequent monitoring, and decreased factor utilization. Factor activity levels should be checked periodically during continuous infusion, with the interval determined by the previous level, dose adjustments, and clinical bleeding. Continuous infusions should not have an attached filter, and the factor product should only be mixed with normal saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemophilia B (deficiency of factor IX [factor 9])</strong> &ndash; <strong>Give an initial dose of factor IX of 100 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</strong></span> to raise the factor IX level to 100 percent. This calculation assumes a starting factor IX activity level close to 0 percent, and a desired factor activity level of 100 percent, and a volume of distribution of approximately 1.0.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dose equals the patient's weight (in kg) multiplied by the desired rise in factor IX level (as a whole number, such that a desired factor level of 100 percent is entered as 100) multiplied by the volume of distribution (for factor IX, this equals approximately 1.0). As an example, for a 60 kg patient who requires an increase to 100 percent, the dose would be 60 kg x 100 x 1 = 6000 units of factor IX. Some factor IX products require an additional multiplier based on slightly increased or decreased volume of distribution:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For AlphaNine, Mononine, and Ixinity, no additional calculations are needed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For BeneFIX, multiply by 1.4 for children (ie, weight in kg x desired increase x 1.4) and 1.2 for adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For Rixubis, multiply by 1.4 for children and by 1.4 for adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For Alprolix, multiply by 1.6 (range, 1.4 to 1.67) for children; no additional calculations are needed for adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For Idelvion, no additional calculations are needed for children; for adults multiply by 0.77</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The second and subsequent doses are given at intervals of approximately one half-life of the infused product for that patient, which is based on peak and trough levels as described below. A typical half-life for standard half-life factor IX products is approximately 18 to 24 hours. Approximate half-lives for longer-lasting factor IX products range from 54 to 104 hours. Approximately half-lives for specific products are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F109839\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109839 \">table 3</a>). These doses will be approximately half the initial dose, and will be guided by the patient's measured factor level and the desired peak level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another option is to give the initial factor IX bolus followed by a continuous infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/11,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-15</a>].

Factor activity levels should be checked periodically during continuous infusion, with the interval determined by the previous level, dose adjustments, and clinical bleeding. Continuous infusions should not have an attached filter and the factor product should only be mixed with normal saline.</p><p/><p>As noted above, subsequent factor dosing for patients receiving bolus doses of factor should incorporate information on the patient's peak and trough factor activity levels (or steady state levels for those receiving continuous infusion) rather than a set schedule without monitoring. This is because individual pharmacokinetics vary and can significantly impact factor half-life and ultimate hemostasis. Patient characteristics such as the volume of distribution and recovery may be altered by individual handling of drugs and body fat content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The peak factor activity level should be checked approximately 5 to 15 minutes after the first dose. For major life-threatening bleeding, the trough is checked at approximately 4 to 6 hours for factor VIII and 8 to 12 hours for factor IX. Slightly longer intervals before the first trough level may be used for less-serious bleeding.</p><p>As noted above, for patients receiving bolus doses of factor, the second and subsequent doses will be given at intervals of approximately one half-life. If the trough factor activity is lower than expected, the dosing interval may be shortened <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the subsequent dose increased depending on peak levels. If the trough factor activity level is higher than expected, the dosing interval may be increased <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the subsequent dose may be lowered.</p><p>The duration of factor replacement therapy for severe or potentially serious bleeding is individualized based upon a variety of issues including need for surgery, extent of bleeding, site of bleeding, presence of an injury or target joint, and response (eg, reduction in bleeding, healing) to infusion therapy. Therapy may be continued after acute intensive treatment as the patient may require physical therapy or rehabilitation and may need to use prophylactic dosing until full recovery is achieved.</p><p>For head trauma, we start treatment as soon as possible at the time of injury and often treat for at least three days, including significant trauma with negative imaging. Late bleeding following head trauma can occur up to three to four weeks following the event. Thus, individuals with head trauma or other severe bleeding should be instructed about signs of late or recurrent bleeding, plans for factor dosing should these occur, and parameters for seeking medical attention. This includes instructions about the signs and symptoms of central nervous system bleeding, so that repeat infusion, clinical and radiological assessment, and hospitalization occur at the earliest manifestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3800937394\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemarthroses</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2825852962\"><span class=\"h3\">Considerations for hemarthroses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding into a joint (hemarthrosis) is one of the most common manifestations of hemophilia. Joint bleeds are characterized by reduced range of motion associated with pain or other unusual sensation (eg, tingling that often precedes pain), palpable swelling or warmth, or other typical findings for that patient. Bleeding into hip joints is concerning due to the greater risk of increased intra-articular pressure and osteonecrosis of the femoral head. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Joints and muscle'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients develop a &quot;target joint&quot; in which repeated bleeding episodes and chronic inflammatory changes occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hemophilia#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hemophilia&quot;, section on 'Hemophilic arthropathy'</a>.)</p><p>The major aspects of assessment and management of joint bleeding include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor should be infused promptly at the first sign of joint bleeding (eg, at the onset tingling characteristic of joint bleeding rather than waiting for reduced range of motion or swelling). (See <a href=\"#H2996978111\" class=\"local\">'Factor dosing for joint bleeds'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional interventions to reduce bleeding, pain, and inflammation include avoidance of weight bearing or use of the affected extremity, application of ice packs, immobilization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splinting as recommended, and analgesics as needed (generally avoiding agents with antiplatelet activity such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [NSAIDs], although these may be used in some circumstances such as significant joint inflammation in a patient receiving factor replacement). Selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitors may be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical evaluation is used to distinguish an acute bleed from other conditions such as pain due to chronic arthropathy, acute fracture or sprain, or infection. In many cases, this assessment is based on the history and physical examination rather than radiography or ultrasound examinations. Arthrocentesis is not required to diagnose joint bleeding in patients with hemophilia. If arthrocentesis is deemed necessary (eg, due to concern of a septic joint or to reduce pressure from accumulated blood) it should only be performed after factor has been administered to raise the factor level to 100 percent in conjunction with a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center. Ultrasound may be useful to distinguish an acute bleed from pain associated with chronic arthropathy. (See <a href=\"#H3753608807\" class=\"local\">'Overview of surgical planning'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It may be challenging to distinguish hemarthrosis of the hip from bleeding into the iliopsoas muscle. In general, hemarthrosis of the hip results in severe pain with hip motion, whereas iliopsoas bleeding primarily causes limited hip extension. Iliopsoas bleeding may also cause reduced sensation over the ipsilateral thigh due to compression of the sacral plexus root of the femoral nerve. Ultrasonography or other radiologic evaluation may be helpful in identifying hematoma in the iliopsoas region versus the hip joint. (See <a href=\"#H24022061\" class=\"local\">'Muscle/Soft tissue bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decision must be made regarding whether the patient requires at-home versus in-hospital treatment. The majority of hemarthroses are managed at home. Indications for hospitalization include painful, swollen major joints; initial delay in therapy; bleeding episodes that are not responding as expected at home; associated pain that is not controlled with home oral analgesia; inability to adhere to home instructions, including children who cannot be non-weight bearing; advanced bleeding that was treated late or in association with an injury that requires more intensive treatment and intervention; suspicion of an infection; and bleeding in an individual with an inhibitor that is not responding well at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other acute management needs that may be addressed in patients whose bleeding does not rapidly respond to factor infusion and local measures at home include possible admission with use of continuous infusion, inhibitor testing to assure an inhibitor has not developed, possible joint aspiration to remove blood and relieve pressure, other hemostatic therapies, and glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arthrocentesis may be appropriate if there is neurovascular compromise, severe pain, or other evidence of increased joint pressure that has not improved with other treatment, or there is suspicion of an infection. If joint aspiration is performed, replacement therapy should be administered to raise the factor level to 100 percent before the procedure. Inhibitor patients require use of bypassing therapy and should be treated at a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other hemostatic therapies for individuals with inhibitors or those whose bleeding is not controlled by factor infusion are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H24022363\" class=\"local\">'Therapies other than factor replacement'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a target joint has undergone repeated hemorrhage, we often administer a short course of glucocorticoids as appropriate to reduce pain and swelling associated with synovial inflammation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> for three to five days), as long as the patient does not have an active infection. A benefit from a short course of glucocorticoids was demonstrated in a pair of trials that randomly assigned 35 children with hemophilia and a joint bleed to receive prednisone (1 mg per pound of body weight per day [equivalent to approximately 0.45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> maximum dose, 80 mg] for three days) or placebo along with factor replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Compared with controls, the children assigned to prednisone had similar outcomes but required less factor infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be challenging to determine when acute bleeding into a joint has stopped. Patient report of bleeding is most commonly used, and ultrasound may be helpful as well. Most experts continue to treat with a course of therapy designed to allow bleed resolution and prevent rebleeding based upon patient circumstances and the presence of a target joint, injury, or inhibitor. The duration of therapy depends on the joint affected, the size of the hemarthrosis, and the ability to avoid weight bearing, which affects the pace of healing. Some experts treat for approximately three to four days after bleeding has stopped; questions should be directed to the local HTC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint surgery for chronic synovitis or arthropathy may be indicated in some cases. Various procedures may be offered, including synovectomy, either isotopic or surgical, for recurrent bleeding or joint replacement for extensive joint damage. A 2016 meta-analysis of studies evaluating the role of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in people with hemophilia reviewed outcomes of 336 procedures in 254 individuals and found an overall improvement in range of motion, although not as great as that of individuals without hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The complication rate was 32 percent; common complications included infections, bleeding, and bone abnormalities. Decisions regarding the use of invasive procedures are best made in close consultation between the patient, and an experienced multidisciplinary team including a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center hematologist (to confirm that factor replacement and other hemostatic therapies have been optimally administered) and the surgeon or interventional radiologist (to assess the feasibility of the procedure and likelihood of efficacy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following resolution of a joint bleed, it is important to initiate a rehabilitation program that involves gradual increased range of motion, weight bearing, and strength training. Attention to bone health (eg, adequate vitamin D and knowledge regarding the presence of osteopenia) is also indicated. Involvement of a physical therapist with expertise in hemophilia to design a rehabilitative program is helpful. Individuals who are not receiving routine prophylaxis should consider using a form of prophylaxis including limited short-term prophylaxis following recurrent target joint hemarthrosis, with factor administration for several weeks to months to reduce or prevent recurrent bleeding, or to use a more aggressive dosing schedule in individuals who are already receiving routine prophylaxis. Prophylaxis is discussed separately.

For some patients who are able to identify the early symptoms of a joint bleed and rapidly administer factor, a single dose of factor may be sufficient. However, some comprehensive treatment centers use more intensive therapy for hemarthroses for specific patients or all patients (eg, for hemophilia A, an initial factor VIII dose of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> followed by additional doses of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> at 24 and 72 hours after the first dose; for hemophilia B, an initial factor IX dose to provide a target level of 80 percent activity followed by additional doses to provide 40 percent activity, with the interval determined by the half-life of the factor IX product used) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

DDAVP may be used in patients with mild hemophilia A who have been demonstrated to have an adequate response and in appropriate procedures (eg, dental procedures). Antifibrinolytics are often useful in dental procedures.

The dose is calculated from the patient's weight, baseline factor level, desired factor level, volume of distribution, and presence of an inhibitor as described in the dosing sections above. For the first dose, we assume the baseline factor level to be 0 percent, with the exception of those with baseline factor levels &gt;20 percent, for whom it may be appropriate to subtract the baseline factor level from the desired factor level to calculate the desired increase.</p><p>After infusion, the factor level should be checked before proceeding with the operative intervention for all procedures other than routine outpatient dental procedures. In a patient with an inhibitor who is using bypassing therapy, there is no coagulation test that reflects clinical efficacy; therefore, laboratory monitoring of factor activity levels is not used. Subsequent dosing is based on the plan of care developed, the patient's clinical status, and the measured levels, which if bolus dosing is used are typically measured at 8 to 12 hours after the previous dose for factor VIII and 12 to 24 hours after the previous dose for factor IX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In addition, levels are often obtained in the recovery room to assure adequate hemostasis.</p><p>For the management of major surgery in which postoperative continuous infusion is planned, it is important to note that factor VIII and IX clearance is increased during surgery (ie, consumption is increased) due to expected operative bleeding. Accordingly, if an immediate factor level is not available, it is probably prudent to give an additional bolus prior to starting the continuous infusion, with an amount of factor equivalent to half the initial bolus. This is especially pertinent to orthopedic procedures.</p><p>If there is unexpected postoperative bleeding, it is important to obtain an immediate (stat) factor level and to consider the possibility that bleeding may be due to an anatomic or mechanical cause (eg, need for ligation of blood vessels) if adequate hemostatic factor levels are documented.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of long half-life factor VIII products (eg, recombinant factor VIII-Fc fusion; PEGylated recombinant factor VIII) has been demonstrated in small studies in which patients with hemophilia A were managed perioperatively for major and minor surgeries and had excellent hemostasis without serious adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Product consistency during outpatient and inpatient use is important, and if the patient uses a longer-lasting product or specific product at home, we use the same product in the hospital if possible. (See <a href=\"#H2564355296\" class=\"local\">'Patients receiving longer-lasting factor'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with mild hemophilia A and those who have received intensive factor replacement for the first time should be re-screened for inhibitors at the completion of therapy, and at approximately one to three months postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Orthopedic procedures are the most commonly performed major surgical procedures in people with hemophilia. Individuals with hemophilia can undergo any type of major surgery (eg, cancer surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) as long as factor replacement is given and adequate hemostasis assured.

Most recommendations including the 2012 World Federation of Hemophilia guideline use a desired preoperative factor level for major surgery of 80 to 100 percent for hemophilia A and 60 to 80 percent for hemophilia B, with postoperative levels gradually tapering to approximately 50 percent until the wound is healed (typically over a period of 10 to 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Circumcision in the neonatal period is often the first bleeding challenge in an individual with hemophilia, and in some cases the first clue to the diagnosis. All individuals for whom the diagnosis of hemophilia is possible based on family history should have factor activity testing with results obtained and discussed with a hemophilia treatment center hematologist before a circumcision is performed.

These clotting factor products contain an activated form of a downstream clotting factor in the coagulation cascade. Activated factor VII (factor VIIa) can directly activate factor X, bypassing the need for factors VIII and IX. Available products include recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven, NovoSeven RT) and activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs) such as FEIBA (factor eight inhibitor bypassing agent; the only aPCC available in most settings) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94210 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Both rFVIIa and FEIBA contain activated clotting factors and both are effective for hemostasis in hemophilia.

Standard interval dosing is generally continued for at least 48 to 72 hours for severe bleeding or major surgery (shorter durations for minor surgery), followed by a taper in which the dosing interval is gradually increased. In cases of severe uncontrolled bleeding, it is important to remember that therapy with one bypassing product may be effective even if the other bypassing product has failed. Also, the patient may have a surgical, traumatic, or anatomic reason for continued bleeding that may need to be addressed surgically or endoscopically. In rare cases of ongoing joint bleeding, arterial embolization has been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Although FEIBA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rFVIIa may be lifesaving in individuals with severe hemophilic bleeding for whom factor replacement is ineffective, these products are prothrombotic and thus attention to the occurrence of this potential complication should be maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Randomized trials comparing FEIBA and rFVIIa in patients with inhibitors and severe bleeding or major surgery are challenging to perform.

Participants were instructed to initiate the treatment within four hours of bleeding symptoms and to record the hemostatic efficacy at several time points. At six hours post-bleeding, the overall efficacy of FEIBA and rFVIIa were similar (81 and 79 percent, respectively); other time points and efficacy measures did not show one product to be clearly superior. However, some individual patients derived greater efficacy from one product or the other, especially during the first 12 hours. Additional smaller randomized trials have also found comparable efficacy of FEIBA and rFVIIa in treating bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Perioperative use of bypassing agents has also been reported to show comparable efficacy of FEIBA and rFVIIa, although there is a greater body of experience with rFVIIa in surgical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>aPCCs may be associated with reactions due to activation of the complement and bradykinin systems when infused rapidly, as well as prothrombotic complications including venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. These risks appear to be greater with aPCCs or in settings of trauma, large repeated doses, or prolonged administration. As noted above, individuals with hemophilia B and an inhibitor can have anaphylactic reactions to factor IX, which is present in all PCCs and aPCCs. rFVIIa and aPCC have been used together in some patients, but this should only be done in the hospital by experienced clinicians at a hemophilia treatment center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1034235546\"><span class=\"h3\">Recombinant porcine factor VIII (hemophilia A)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another option for a patient with hemophilia A and a high-titer inhibitor is recombinant porcine (pig) factor VIII (Obizur), which was initially developed for treating patients with autoantibodies to endogenous factor VIII (ie, acquired factor VIII deficiency [acquired hemophilia A]).

This approach may be effective for patients with hemophilia A or B and a low titer (&lt;5 BU) or a low responding inhibitor, as long as the patient does not have an infusion reaction to the replacement factor (reactions are more commonly seen with factor IX). High-dose factor also may be useful for patients with high responding inhibitors currently at a low titer or a titer lowered by plasmapheresis, with the understanding that this is only likely to be effective for a limited time period (four to seven days) and is likely to induce anamnesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Dosing in this setting has not been established from prospective trials. One approach is to administer the full replacement dose as described for a patient without an inhibitor above, plus an additional 50 percent more factor for every BU of inhibitor. As an example, for a 60 kg patient with factor VIII deficiency and an inhibitor of 2 BU who requires correction to 100 percent factor activity, the patient would be given the usual replacement dose (60 kg x 100 x 0.5 = 3000 units of factor VIII) plus an additional (2 BU x 60 kg x 50 x 0.5 = 3000 units of factor VIII) for a total of 6000 units of factor VIII.</p><p>This may be followed by bolus dosing, based on factor activity level measured 10 to 15 minutes after the infusion is completed, or by continuous infusion, at a starting rate adequate to compensate for altered pharmacokinetics based on the presence of an inhibitor, with dose adjustments based on factor activity levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2564355296\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients receiving longer-lasting factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients use a longer-lasting factor for routine prophylaxis or acute bleeding and thus may have a longer-lasting product in their system or available for use.

Use of longer-lasting products may reduce the number of infusions needed during and after procedures, depending on the product, the patient, and the individual half-life.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemophilia-a-and-b-routine-management-including-prophylaxis#H901872873\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemophilia A and B: Routine management including prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'DDAVP test dose for mild hemophilia A'</a>.)</p><p>For those who respond, a typical dose is 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> (maximum dose, 20 mcg), administered intravenously or subcutaneously; or as a nasal spray (Stimate), one puff (150 mcg) in one nostril in patients weighing &lt;50 kg and two puffs (150 mcg in both nostrils) in patients weighing &ge;50 kg. A repeat dose may be given at 12 hours, and subsequent doses are often administered once daily. When using the nasal spray it is important to use the spray intended for hemostasis and not the spray for enuresis, which has a lower concentration.</p><p>DDAVP can increase the factor VIII level two- to fourfold. A patient with a baseline factor activity of 25 percent who has an increase to 50 percent may have adequate hemostasis with DDAVP in the setting of minor bleeding or procedures and thus avoid factor infusion. Tachyphylaxis may occur; the administration should be timed to provide the maximal response at the time of greatest bleeding risk, while limiting the number of doses.</p><p>The following caveats apply to DDAVP use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DDAVP is <strong>not</strong> effective for patients with severe hemophilia A (factor VIII activity &lt;1 percent) because factor activity level cannot be increased sufficiently, and usually is not used in individuals with moderate hemophilia A (factor VIII activity from 1 to 5 percent) for the same reason.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DDAVP should <strong>only </strong>be used for mild bleeding for which a 30- to 60-minute delay is acceptable and a two- to fourfold factor VIII increase are likely to be sufficient for hemostasis. For more serious bleeding, factor VIII infusion should be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DDAVP is <strong>not</strong> effective for patients with hemophilia B because factor IX is not stored in platelets or endothelial cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DDAVP generally is not used in children under two years of age due to an increased risk of water retention that may result in a syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH)-like picture and potentially cerebral edema and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If used in this age group, it should be done under hematologist supervision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DDAVP has antidiuretic activity and can cause hyponatremia, especially with prolonged use or excess free water intake. As a result, doses often are limited to once daily for three consecutive days, and water intake is restricted. The serum sodium concentration is monitored in hospitalized individuals, especially those receiving more than one or two doses of DDAVP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional adverse effects include facial flushing, headache, nausea, and tingling sensations. These can often be controlled by decreasing the rate of the infusion when administering the medication intravenously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-bleeding-and-perioperative-management-in-hemophilia-a-and-b/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Cases of thrombosis have been reported, although a causal relationship is difficult to establish. Hypotension and hypertension have been reported but are not common and usually are mild. Approaches other than DDAVP may be preferable in older patients with underlying cardiovascular disease.</p><p/><p>In rare patients with mild hemophilia A who have mild bleeding and wish to avoid factor infusion but have not been tested for DDAVP response, it may be reasonable to use DDAVP, especially if a post-dose factor VIII level is obtained; however, evidence to support this practice is lacking. Effective therapy should not be delayed in a bleeding patient, which may occur if the response to DDAVP is not documented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1938560679\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2359696653\" class=\"local\">'Serious, life-threatening bleeding and head trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor should also be infused promptly (within two hours of bleed identification) at the first sign of joint bleeding, with a target factor activity level of approximately 50 percent (for hemophilia A, give 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> of factor VIII; for hemophilia B, give 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> of factor IX). Additional considerations for joint bleeding include need for higher target levels in specific circumstances such as trauma, the need for repeated factor infusions to assure adequate resolution, decisions regarding hospitalization, distinction from other conditions (eg, infection, muscle bleeding), the need for arthrocentesis or a surgical procedure, appropriate rehabilitation, and optimal prophylactic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3800937394\" class=\"local\">'Hemarthroses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with hemophilia undergoing elective surgery, coordination among the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> and all relevant clinicians is essential. This should involve inhibitor screening, determination of desired factor activity levels, and planning for factor activity monitoring and administration. Certain sites of potential bleeding may be especially serious due to their location and possibility of causing airway compromise (eg, retropharyngeal bleeding from tonsillectomy or impacted mandibular wisdom tooth extraction). (See <a href=\"#H3259236617\" class=\"local\">'Elective surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of bleeding and surgery in patients with hemophilia with an inhibitor (neutralizing antibodies against infused factor) is especially challenging. For a patient with a high titer and high responding inhibitor (eg, 5 to 10 Bethesda units or greater) who has serious bleeding or requires major surgery, a bypassing product (eg, FEIBA or recombinant factor VIIa) is used. For patients with a low responding inhibitor, options include factor concentrates or other hemostatic agents. Inhibitor <span class=\"nowrap\">eradication/immune</span> tolerance induction should be addressed. (See <a href=\"#H3225624639\" class=\"local\">'Inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24022363\" class=\"local\">'Therapies other than factor replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antifibrinolytic therapy is a useful adjunct for stabilizing clots in areas of increased fibrinolysis (eg, oral cavity, nasal bleeding).

DDAVP can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or intranasally.
