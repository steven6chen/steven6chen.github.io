Idiopathic anaphylaxis is diagnosed when no specific trigger can be identified after an appropriate evaluation and when conditions, such as systemic mastocytosis, have been ruled out. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-confirming-the-diagnosis-and-determining-the-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Confirming the diagnosis and determining the cause(s)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of idiopathic anaphylaxis. Other aspects of anaphylaxis are discussed separately.

Symptoms of anaphylaxis involve multiple body organ systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis#H4007691360\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Acute diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Definition and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is based upon a detailed description of the acute episode, including antecedent activities and events. The diagnosis of idiopathic anaphylaxis is made when a patient has signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis, but no specific trigger can be identified, and other diseases have been ruled out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic anaphylaxis is more common in adults, although it also occurs in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In several series, up to 70 percent of patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis were female and approximately 50 percent of patients were atopic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>]. Patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis may also have episodes of anaphylaxis caused by known triggers, such as food, medications, and exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence of idiopathic anaphylaxis in the United States is estimated at approximately 1 in 10,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic anaphylaxis is associated with increased activation of mast cells, as is anaphylaxis with a known trigger. Patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis also have increased activation of lymphocytes, although the significance of this is not clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis#H287552937\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Acute diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Causes and mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mast cell activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis have transient elevations in levels of mast cell mediators, including plasma and urinary histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and serum or plasma total tryptase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>], immediately following an episode of anaphylaxis. Between episodes, mediator levels should return to within the normal range. Other disorders with similar elevations in mast cell mediators are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H13912230\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no data to support the hypothesis that mast cells in patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis are hyper-responsive, although research in this area is limited. In a study of 56 patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis, mast cell precursors were collected from peripheral blood, cultured in vitro, and tested for immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated release of beta-hexosaminidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Mast cells from patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis and healthy controls responded similarly, indicating that the patients' mast cells were not hyper-responsive through the classic IgE-mediated mechanism. However, mast cells have multiple other mechanisms for activation, which have not been specifically studied. The investigators did note that peripheral blood from patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis yielded higher mast cell numbers in culture compared with healthy controls for unknown reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphocyte and basophil activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis have an increased percentage of activated T cells in their peripheral blood during acute episodes compared with during remission. In addition, they have more activated B cells, both during acute episodes and in remission, than in the general population or in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In microarray analyses, cells from patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis differentially express genes that strongly correlate with the level of CD203c, a marker of basophil activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of idiopathic anaphylaxis are the same as in anaphylaxis resulting from known triggers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 1</a>). The severity spectrum is also similar. Fatal and near fatal cases of idiopathic anaphylaxis have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis who do not meet one of these criteria are categorized as having infrequent idiopathic anaphylaxis.</p><p>Generalized idiopathic anaphylaxis is characterized by urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema plus severe systemic symptoms (cardiovascular, respiratory symptoms, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal). Occasional patients have idiopathic anaphylaxis-angioedema characterized by marked upper airway obstruction due to severe angioedema of the tongue, pharynx, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larynx. In patients with episodic angioedema, disorders causing bradykinin-induced angioedema, such as C1 inhibitor deficiency and ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, should be considered in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H13912230\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic anaphylaxis is a diagnosis of exclusion, by definition. Patients suspected of having idiopathic anaphylaxis should be referred to an allergy specialist. All possible triggers of anaphylaxis and disorders that mimic anaphylaxis should be considered and ruled out before making the diagnosis. Idiopathic anaphylaxis is established only after performing a comprehensive history, physical examination, review of medical records, and appropriate laboratory tests.

The use of a combination of glucocorticoids and H1 antihistamines is based upon case reports and observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/2,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,38</a>]. All studies examining efficacy of glucocorticoids have included concomitant therapy with an H1 antihistamine. As an example, in one series, 22 patients were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a>, and some received an oral sympathomimetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Nineteen of 22 patients had fewer attacks after the initiation of treatment. After completing this therapy, approximately 50 percent of patients went into remission (ie, no episodes and no prednisone treatment in the past year). Some of these patients remained on an H1 antihistamine.</p><p>The combination of a glucocorticoid and an antihistamine to prevent subsequent attacks can be started at the time of an acute episode or as soon as the diagnosis has been reached:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> &ndash; A typical empirical regimen is initiated with 40 to 60 mg orally per day for one week, or until the patient's symptoms cease. The same dose (40 to 60 mg) is then given on alternate days for two more weeks. The dose is then further reduced by 5 to 10 mg (still on alternate days) every two weeks, assuming there are no breakthrough symptoms. Patients usually stop having episodes after the first week of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-anaphylaxis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The glucocorticoid dose is increased if a patient has breakthrough symptoms during the taper. The dose is decreased again once attacks are under control. If this subsequent taper is not tolerated, adjunctive medications are considered. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid-dependent idiopathic anaphylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H1 antihistamine &ndash; An H1 antihistamine is usually administered concomitantly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. Although only first-generation antihistamines have been studied for the treatment of idiopathic anaphylaxis, second-generation antihistamines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a> (10 mg orally per day), are preferred as first-line treatment due to their more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio. The H1 antihistamine is often continued after completion of the course of prednisone, especially in patients who are older, have a history of more severe episodes, and have comorbidities.
