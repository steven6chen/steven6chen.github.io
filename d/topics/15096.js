It is possible for women with rheumatoid arthritis (often called &quot;RA&quot;) to have healthy pregnancies. But you will need to work closely with your doctors. They will make sure that you are doing the right things to control your symptoms and protect your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569235\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do before trying to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is very important to talk to your doctor <strong>before</strong> you start trying to get pregnant. You will need to see an obstetrician (a doctor who takes care of pregnant women), your rheumatologist (the doctor who handles your RA), and your primary care doctor. They can make sure that any medicines you take are safe to use during pregnancy. They might also do some tests to make sure your body is ready for a pregnancy.</p><p>Some RA medicines can cause serious problems for a baby. You will need to stop taking these before getting pregnant:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Methotrexate</a> (sample brand names: Rheumatrex, Trexall) &ndash; If you take this medicine, you should stop it at least <strong>1 month (3 months is even better)</strong> before trying to get pregnant. This medicine is very dangerous for a baby.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Leflunomide</a> (brand name: Arava) &ndash; If you take this medicine, you should stop it at least <strong>2 years</strong> before trying to get pregnant. Or your doctor can give you another medicine to make the leflunomide leave your body faster. Then he or she can do a test to be sure it is out of your body before you try to get pregnant.</p><p/><p>You might need to stop taking other drugs, too.</p><p>If you do get pregnant while taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">methotrexate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">leflunomide</a>, tell your doctors right away. Your doctors will help you decide whether to stop (or switch) any other medicines you are taking. Plus, they might suggest added treatment.</p><p>There are also steps that <strong>all</strong> women should take before trying to get pregnant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569242\"><span class=\"h1\">How will my rheumatoid arthritis affect my pregnancy and my baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RA does not usually cause problems with pregnancy or the baby's health. But some women with RA might not get pregnant as quickly as other women. Also, some medicines used to treat RA can be unsafe for a baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569249\"><span class=\"h1\">How will my medicines affect my pregnancy or my baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some RA medicines can hurt an unborn baby. You should not use these during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Methotrexate</a> can cause miscarriage (when the pregnancy ends before 20 weeks). It can also cause the baby to not develop correctly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Leflunomide</a> can cause the baby to not develop correctly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High doses of steroids in early pregnancy can increase the risk of a birth defect called &quot;cleft palate.&quot; (In babies with cleft palate, the roof of the baby's mouth does not form properly.) High doses of steroids later in pregnancy can cause other problems, such as the mother's water breaking too early.</p><p/><p>It is important to talk to your doctors about <strong>all</strong> medicines you take and follow their directions carefully. Do not start taking any new medicines, supplements, or herbal drugs without talking to your doctors first.</p><p>Some RA medicines can be taken during pregnancy, but only at certain times or in certain amounts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs &ndash; These include medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>. They can safely be used at some times in pregnancy, but not at other times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroids &ndash; These medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">prednisone</a>, are fairly safe in low doses during pregnancy. They are often used in pregnant women with RA to help keep the disease under control. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.)</p><p/><p>There are other safe medicines available, too. Your doctors can help you decide how best to treat your RA symptoms without hurting your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569256\"><span class=\"h1\">Will pregnancy affect my rheumatoid arthritis symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It might. Many women with RA notice that their symptoms get better during pregnancy. But some women's symptoms stay the same or get worse.</p><p>Some normal pregnancy symptoms are similar to RA symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the hands, feet, or ankles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or pain in the hands</p><p/><p>Even if your RA symptoms get better during pregnancy, they often get worse again after the baby is born. Your doctor will decide when to start up your regular RA medicines again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569263\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I be able to breastfeed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Women with RA can safely breastfeed. But they have to avoid certain medicines while they do. Some RA medicines can get into breast milk and be harmful to a baby.</p><p>If you want to breastfeed, talk to your doctors. They can tell you which medicines you can take and which ones to avoid. Most of the medicines that are unsafe during pregnancy are also unsafe while breastfeeding. Some women need to stop breastfeeding if they need these medicines to control their RA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569360\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
