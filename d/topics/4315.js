The primary goal of colposcopy is to identify precancerous and cancerous lesions so that they may be treated early.</p><p>Colposcopy is performed most commonly of the cervix, and is the main focus of this topic. It is used as further evaluation of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests (cytology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> human papillomavirus testing).</p><p>Colposcopic evaluation is based on the finding that malignant and premalignant epithelium have specific visual characteristics in terms of contour, color, and vascular pattern that are recognizable using colposcopy. The improved visualization of epithelial surfaces with colposcopy compared with gross visual examination enhances the colposcopist's ability to distinguish normal from abnormal areas and to obtain directed biopsies.</p><p>The techniques for colposcopy of the female lower genital tract are reviewed here.

Vaginitis due to <em>Trichomonas vaginalis </em>can cause cervicitis, but other vaginal infections do not affect visualization with colposcopy. However, treatment of vaginitis before colposcopy may allow the patient to be more comfortable during the examination if the patient has vaginal discomfort or discharge.

The superior portion is continuous with the uterus. The cervical canal opens into the endometrial cavity at the internal os and into the vagina at the external os.</p><p>The inferior portion of the cervix protrudes into the vagina. In some women (eg, postmenopausal, following pelvic radiation), the cervix may appear flush with the vagina on examination rather than protruding.</p><p>The ectocervix is the surface of the cervix that protrudes into the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F106232\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106232 \">figure 1</a>). It is covered with squamous epithelium. The endocervix is the cervical canal, which is lined with columnar (glandular) epithelium.</p><p>The squamocolumnar junction of the cervix (junction of squamous and glandular cells, generally at the external cervical os) and the transformation zone (the transformation zone is the area between the original squamocolumnar junction and the current one) are the areas at greatest risk for neoplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105120\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105120 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F102479\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102479 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105122\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105122 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The transformation zone is an area of squamous metaplasia that lies between the squamocolumnar junction and the remainder of the squamous epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The transformation zone contains embryonic cells that may be especially vulnerable to infection with human papillomavirus and to oncogenic transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Specifications and set-up of the colposcope include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the start of the procedure, the clinician should adjust the intraocular distance between the two eyepieces on the colposcope to ensure binocular vision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The colposcope should be placed approximately 30 cm from the tissue that is being visualized. Most colposcopes have a focal length (ie, working distance between the lens and target tissue) of 30 cm. This focal length allows the colposcopist the appropriate amount of room to comfortably reach the cervix with instruments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colposcopes differ by manufacturer, and magnification can range from 3.5x to 30x. On conventional colposcopes, the head of the colposcope is moved closer and farther from the patient, and this changes the focus, and sometimes the magnification. One type of video colposcope automatically adjusts the magnification, depending on how close the scope is to the patient, and this is based on the focus. Fine focusing can be done by turning a knob; coarse focusing is performed by moving the instrument toward or away from the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low power (2x to 10x) is often used to obtain an overall impression of surface architecture and for examination of the vulva. Medium (10x to 20x) and high (20x to 25x) powers are utilized to evaluate the vagina and cervix, with high power being particularly useful for close inspection of vascular patterns, which can signify high-grade or invasive disease. A consistent plan for magnification (usually starting at 15x) is important so that examinations are comparable and reproducible. In general we use a magnification of 15x for the cervix and vagina and 3.5 to 7.5x for evaluation of the vulva, as the organ is closer and thus requires less magnification.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The examination should begin with white light at a low-power setting for a global view of the cervix.

The biggest risk factor for cervical neoplasia is a history of cervical neoplasia, especially recurrent or persistent abnormal results over a period of years.</p><p>The lower genital tract history and review of records should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior cervical cytology (Pap test) and human papillomavirus tests, normal and abnormal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior cervical, vulvar, and vaginal biopsy results</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of lower genital tract cancers or precancers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of condyloma (genital warts)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatments to the cervix, vagina, and vulva</p><p/><p>If possible, documentation of prior abnormal results should be obtained to confirm the history. For most patients, the written reports of previous cytology and histology are sufficient. In some cases, in our practice, we request the slides and have them reviewed by our pathology laboratory. In general, we do this when the patient is seeing us for a second opinion or when there is a discrepancy between the cytology and biopsy result (especially when the cytology results is a high-grade squamous epithelial lesion or adenocarcinoma in situ and we are unable to find a lesion on colposcopic examination that explains this abnormality).</p><p>In addition, a relevant medical history should be obtained, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstetric and gynecologic history &ndash; Last menstrual period, history of sexually transmitted infections, birth control method (if appropriate), history of cervical or pelvic surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression &ndash; Immunosuppression increases the risk of progression of cervical neoplasia (eg, human immunodeficiency virus infection, autoimmune disease, history of transplant or cancer, or immunosuppressant medications).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking history &ndash; The risk of cervical neoplasia is increased in cigarette smokers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that impact the safety of the procedure &ndash; Anticoagulation, bleeding disorders, allergy to iodine.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3021568319\"><span class=\"h2\">Informed consent and counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure should be explained to the patient.

However, colposcopic findings themselves are not diagnostic of cervical neoplasia; this can only be established definitively by pathologic examination of the biopsied tissue.</p><p>Colposcopy by an experienced colposcopist will usually detect sites of significant disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2, 3, cancer), but some women with a normal colposcopic examination can still have a significant histologic abnormality. For this reason, it is important to reconcile the cytologic, colposcopic, and histologic findings in formulating a diagnosis and management plan for each woman.</p><p>To begin the procedure, the patient is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. The vulva is examined under gross visualization for any suspicious lesions or findings that require biopsy or colposcopic examination. A speculum is placed in the vagina; it is best to use the largest speculum that the patient can easily tolerate so that the entire cervix and vaginal fornices may be visualized.</p><p>Colposcopy is typically well-tolerated, and anesthesia or analgesia are not usually required. A review of 19 randomized trials found no difference in pain scores in women given an oral analgesic compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1444576933\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Repeat cytology and HPV testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cytology is repeated (with HPV testing, if indicated) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82951 \">table 2</a>). The Pap test is repeated because abnormal cervical cytology findings (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) may resolve or progress over time. A current cytologic result enables the colposcopist to make the most accurate correlation of cytologic, colposcopic, and histologic findings.</p><p>Traditionally, it was advised that the interval between cervical cytology tests be at least six weeks, but it appears that shorter intervals do not compromise the adequacy of the specimen.

This allows improved colposcopic visualization of abnormal areas. The acetic acid is applied generously to the cervix using a cotton swab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After 30 to 60 seconds, the acidic solution dehydrates cells so that squamous cells with relatively large or dense nuclei (eg, metaplastic cells, dysplastic cells, cells infected with HPV) reflect light and thus appear white [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This is referred to as &quot;acetowhite change.&quot; Blood vessels and columnar cells are not affected but become easier to visualize against the white background. The acetic acid should be reapplied, as needed, after three to five minutes. If excessive acetic acid pools in the vagina, it should be removed with dry swabs, as it can cause irritation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If no lesions are seen after acetic acid is applied, a dilute <strong>Lugol</strong> or <strong>Schiller</strong> solution may be applied to the cervix and vagina to aid in detection. Lugol's iodine consists of 5 g of iodine and 10 g of potassium iodide in 100 mL distilled water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Uniform uptake of stain would confirm the colposcopist's impression that no lesion is present. Glycogen-containing cells will take up iodine and become dark brown. Nonglycogenated cells, such as normal columnar or glandular cells, high-grade lesions, and many low-grade lesions, will not take up iodine and remain light yellow. Thus, they can be easily differentiated from normal tissue for sampling or treatment purposes. Iodine staining should not reveal any lesions the examiner has not previously identified with saline or acetic acid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differential light absorption by squamous versus glandular cells &ndash; A tissue characteristic that helps to differentiate between cell types is that squamous and glandular cells have a differential absorption of light. The squamous cells of the ectocervix have a smooth grey-pink appearance and the glandular cells of the endocervix have a pink-red cobblestone appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F106232\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106232 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Green or blue filter &ndash; Use of the green or blue filter on the colposcope can accentuate abnormal vasculature. Visualized through the green or blue filter, the blood vessels appear darker and this sharpens the contrast between vessels and the surrounding epithelium.</p><p/><p>After the cervix is examined, the <strong>upper one-third of the vagina</strong>, in particular the lateral fornices, is also examined. The transformation zone and squamocolumnar junction may extend into the upper vagina, particularly in younger patients. Abnormal vaginal findings include adenosis, polyps, cysts, diethylstilbestrol morphology, condyloma, and changes suggestive of preinvasive or invasive disease.

Guidance to address these challenges includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The squamocolumnar junction is always a circumferential region around the external cervical os. However, the distance between the os and the edges of the junction varies. In some women, the distance between the os and the edges of the junction is narrow or the squamocolumnar junction is not visible because it recedes within the endocervical canal. The location and size of the junction is altered by several factors:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hormonal factors &ndash; Conditions or medications that result in high serum estrogen levels (eg, pregnancy, oral contraceptives) cause the squamocolumnar junction to be more everted. If a great degree of eversion is present, the columnar epithelium is exposed to the vaginal milieu; this is referred to as ectropion. Ectropion is common during pregnancy or in adolescents. In contrast, menopause may cause the squamocolumnar to recede into the cervical canal.

The Kevorkian cervical biopsy instrument (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105214\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105214 \">picture 9</a>) is most commonly used. The amount of tissue removed is approximately 1 to 2 mm. These biopsies are referred to as punch biopsies.</p><p>Local anesthesia is not routinely used for biopsies of the cervix and upper vagina, since injection of the anesthetic is probably as painful as the biopsy. Injection of an anesthetic may also disrupt the epithelium, making visualization of the lesion more difficult. Distraction techniques (eg, visual distraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], music, or verbal distraction) are as effective as local anesthetic injection, require less time, and have no risk of intravascular injection of anesthetic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Topical and oral analgesics are ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. One technique is to ask the patient to cough and perform the biopsy during the cough.</p><p>Each specimen is individually labeled according to its location on the cervix as if taken from the face of a clock (eg, biopsy at 2:00 or 10:00) and each biopsy specimen is placed in a separate, labeled container containing a permanent fixative.</p><p>There has been a shift in practice in terms of the number of biopsies performed. Traditionally, only a single biopsy was obtained from the most abnormal appearing area of the cervix. Some of the reasons for limiting the number of biopsies were that biopsies are painful and there is a balance between biopsying every lesion and maintaining a patient's comfort and willingness to return for care. However, it has been found that detection of CIN is enhanced by obtaining multiple biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. There appears to be no concern for harm from multiple biopsies. In a prospective study, biopsy of multiple versus single sites was not associated with an increased likelihood of acquiring new HPV infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The best available data on this issue are from the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined <span class=\"nowrap\">Significance/Low-Grade</span> Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions Triage Study, a randomized trial of evaluation of abnormal cervical cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Observational data from this trial were used to evaluate the sensitivity of a CIN 2+ colposcopic biopsy at enrollment to detect women who were diagnosed with CIN 3+ over a two-year study period. The sensitivity of two (82 percent) or three or more (83.3 percent) biopsies was superior to one biopsy (68 percent).</p><p>In general, in our practice, we biopsy no more than two lesions, unless there is a significant suspicion of cancer or many areas of abnormality that appear distinct from each other. Biopsies may be taken from any part of the most abnormal appearing area or from more than one abnormal appearing area. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness'</a> below.)</p><p>The order of taking the biopsies should be from posterior to anterior; this is the best order to avoid bleeding that blocks visualization of the other biopsy sites. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ferric subsulfate</a> (Monsel's solution) is applied with either small or large cotton swabs to the biopsied areas to control bleeding. In case of significant bleeding, having surgical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaginal packs available is advisable.</p><p>For patients at an increased risk of bleeding, care should be taken to obtain very small biopsies and limit the number of biopsies obtained. Patients with risk factors for complications should be referred to an experienced clinician for colposcopy, if available. Factors that increase the risk of bleeding from cervical biopsies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulants or bleeding disorders.

Approximately 5 to 15 percent of patients with high-grade CIN are diagnosed solely based on the ECC specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. Some data suggest that ECC increases the sensitivity of the examination, particularly in older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In addition, ECC may sample cells from &quot;skip lesions&quot; (noncontiguous lesions) that are typical of glandular neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Some clinicians do not perform ECC in all patients.

(See <a href=\"#H1382021\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> below.)</p><p>To perform an ECC, a long straight curette is inserted into the endocervical canal and used to scrape the four quadrants of the canal. An endocervical brush is then inserted and rotated to remove any exfoliated tissue. These specimens should be collected and labeled as a specimen separate from other specimens obtained (ie, biopsies). A drop of mucus and blood is often seen at the os after ECC, and this should be included in the specimen.</p><p>ECC samples are intended to be from the endocervical canal but may be contaminated by cells from the ectocervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F106232\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106232 \">figure 1</a>). This is particularly likely in women in whom the transformation zone has receded into the cervical canal (eg, postmenopausal women, women with a prior cone biopsy or ablative therapy). The specimen should be sent even if contamination is suspected. However, if neoplasia is found, it may be unclear whether the neoplasia is present on the ectocervix or endocervix. Thus, the clinician must use their judgement and their level of suspicion that the sample was contaminated. In such cases, positive results may not have the same implications; for example, the clinician might be more willing to follow rather than treat a patient. In our practice, if the cervical cytology was HSIL and the ECC is positive, even if there is suspicion of contamination, we treat with excisional biopsy. If the cytology was LSIL, continued follow-up without excisional surgery is reasonable.</p><p>An ECC that does not show endocervical tissue is an inadequate result and cannot be construed as a negative result. In such cases, if the result may impact management, repeat sampling should be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Documentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colposcopic examinations should be documented in a consistent and reproducible way.</p><p>Documentation should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate or inadequate examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size and location of abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the vagina or vulva were evaluated.

In addition, the margins of any visible lesions must be fully identified for an adequate examination. In addition, to be an adequate examination, the histologic results from biopsies of the lesions should explain the abnormal cytology (ie, if the cytology was high-grade and all biopsies are normal, then the examination was not adequate).</p><p/><p>The <strong>locations of abnormalities</strong> are noted as on the face of the clock (eg, at 2:00 or 10:00). The approximate <strong>size</strong> is documented in millimeters.</p><p>The format of documentation will vary by practice of institution, depending on whether a paper chart or electronic health record (EHR) is used. Some EHRs have diagrams that can be drawn on. Some allow photographs or videos. This technology is particularly useful in educational settings. The clinician should be aware of potential medicolegal issues as future retrospective review of images may identify areas of abnormality that were initially missed. An advantage, however, is that the images may be stored as part of an EHR so that changes may be followed over time. Alternatively, the examination findings can be described in a note.

In this situation, if invasive disease is not found, and a lesser lesion such as CIN 3 is detected, repeat colposcopy by a more experienced colposcopist and review of the referring cytology slide is appropriate before considering more invasive intervention.</p><p>Management recommendations are discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

It has not been found to be an effective screening tool for cervical cancer when used alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of colposcopy to detect CIN and cervical cancer depends upon the experience and training of the colposcopist. An important factor is the ability of the colposcopist to interpret the colposcopic findings and obtain properly directed biopsies. Among experienced colposcopists, there is good interobserver agreement for normal epithelium, CIN 2, 3, and invasive cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There is more interobserver variation in diagnosis of CIN1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, this lack of agreement is also true for histopathologic diagnosis of these entities.</p><p>Colposcopy using the 2011 International Federation of Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy criteria was able to distinguish normal cervix from <span class=\"nowrap\">CIN/carcinoma</span> with a sensitivity of 86 percent and specificity of 30 percent, and to distinguish normal <span class=\"nowrap\">cervix/low-grade</span> lesions (CIN 1) from high-grade lesions (CIN 2,3 or carcinoma) with sensitivity of 61 percent and specificity of 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>One explanation for limitations of the specificity of colposcopy is that acetowhite epithelium is often observed on the anterior and posterior ectocervix, even in the absence of CIN; this may lead to unnecessary biopsies, particular in these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, CIN appears to be similarly distributed in all four quadrants.</p><p>The diagnostic performance of colposcopy for detection of cervical neoplasia was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 32 studies including almost 8000 colposcopic punch biopsies; all patients subsequently underwent excisional biopsy (cone biopsy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure) and the results of excisional biopsy were used as the reference standard. To detect CIN 2 or higher in the excisional biopsy, a colposcopic punch biopsy of CIN 1 or higher had a sensitivity of 91 percent and a specificity of 25 percent and a punch biopsy result of CIN 2 or higher had a sensitivity of 80 percent and a specificity of 63 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Performing two or more biopsies appears to increase sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Options include performing additional biopsies from another part of the most abnormal-appearing lesion, from more than one abnormal-appearing area, or randomly from normal-appearing quadrants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The best approach has not been studied, but at this time random biopsies from normal-appearing cervix do not appear warranted, since this would lead to biopsy of very large numbers of women without disease and in the absence of information about the additional cost and risks of this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">VAGINAL COLPOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colposcopy of the vagina is very similar to that of the cervix, but the natural rugae and folds make the procedure more time-consuming and difficult. A systematic approach, beginning in one quadrant and gradually working to cover all four quadrants, involves applying acetic acid repeatedly, and noting areas of abnormal staining. Adenosis, pigmented lesions, and cysts are usually seen without the need of special stains. It is necessary to rotate the speculum to allow the anterior and posterior vagina to be visualized. Lugol's staining is helpful in delineating lesions, and in ensuring that all abnormal areas have been identified.</p><p>Opening the speculum as much as is feasible pulls the vaginal tissue taught so the rugated surface appears nearly flat and facilitates colposcopy; however, when biopsy is attempted, it is helpful to partially close the speculum to allow the vagina to fold in on itself. Keeping the vagina taut makes biopsy difficult. Cysts and adenosis are usually easy to sample. The site of the lesion is documented using the vaginal apex, urethra, and fourchette as landmarks. Appropriate terminology should be used similar to cervical colposcopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F86246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86246 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Practice varies regarding whether anesthesia is used for vaginal biopsies. Some clinicians use local anesthesia for all vaginal biopsies, while others use it for only distal vaginal biopsies (the distal vagina has somatic innervation, so biopsies may be more painful; the proximal vagina has autonomic innervation).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ferric subsulfate</a> solution and pressure are usually all that are required for hemostasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">VULVAR COLPOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar colposcopy is indicated in women with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visible abnormalities of the vulva</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No abnormalities of the cervix or vagina that can account for the abnormal cervical cytology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal vulvar itch, pain, or burning, without a clear etiology</p><p/><p>Vulvar colposcopy is performed in a similar manner to cervical and vaginal colposcopy.

The cervix can also be evaluated by other modalities. These may be divided into visualization techniques utilizing broad-band light (eg, direct visualization, speculoscopy, cervicography, and colposcopy) and technologies utilizing electronic detection methods (eg, Polarprobe and in-vivo spectroscopy). Four-quadrant biopsy of the squamocolumnar junction is also an acceptable alternative where equipment and experienced personnel to perform colposcopy are not available, but pathology evaluation of the specimens is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/22,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,29</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Visualization techniques</strong> &mdash; Visual inspection techniques have lower specificity than cytology and are generally used in low-resource settings where cervical cytology and colposcopy are not feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/colposcopy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Malignant and premalignant epithelium have specific macroscopic characteristics relating to contour, color, and vascular pattern that can be identified by the colposcopist for directed biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for colposcopy include further assessment of cervical cytologic abnormalities or abnormal human papillomavirus tests, women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero, women with gross abnormalities of the lower genital tract, and as an adjunct to surgery of the cervix, vagina, and vulva. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cervix and vagina are examined with a bright light and then with the colposcope, using saline if necessary. Pigmented areas and obvious lesions are noted. Three to 5 percent acetic acid is applied to the cervix and the cervix is reexamined. A green-filter examination is subsequently performed to accentuate abnormal vasculature. (See <a href=\"#H1444576933\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The colposcopic examination is considered adequate if the entire squamocolumnar junction is visible circumferentially around the os. In addition, the borders of all lesions should be completely visualized and biopsies of the lesions should explain the abnormal cytology. (See <a href=\"#H4253743794\" class=\"local\">'Colposcopic examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metaplastic cells, dysplastic cells, and cells infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) reflect light and thus appear white. Areas of white epithelium are further evaluated for abnormal vascular patterns, such as punctation, mosaicism, or abnormal appearing vessels. (See <a href=\"#H4253743794\" class=\"local\">'Colposcopic examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most abnormally appearing areas are biopsied. Biopsies are relatively contraindicated in patients on anticoagulation medication, who have a known bleeding disorder, or who are pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Biopsies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocervical curettage or sampling is performed in patients with atypical squamous cells (ASC-H), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), atypical glandular cells, adenocarcinoma in situ, and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) but no visible lesion; if ablative treatment is contemplated; and in those with an unsatisfactory colposcopic examination. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Endocervical curettage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colposcopy by an experienced colposcopist will usually detect patients with significant disease (HSIL, cancer), but some women with a normal colposcopic examination can still have a significant histologic abnormality. For this reason, it is important to reconcile the cytologic, colposcopic, and histologic findings in formulating a diagnosis and management plan for each woman and following these women closely. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with persistent abnormalities of cervical cytology over time or who repeatedly test positive for high-risk HPV, and whose initial colposcopy fails to reveal a significant lesion, should have multiple colposcopies and biopsies over time to rule out a high-grade lesion.
