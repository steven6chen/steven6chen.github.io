They work by preparing the body to fight the germs that cause the infections. Vaccines usually come in shots, but some come in nose sprays or medicines that people swallow. Vaccines are also called &quot;vaccinations&quot; or &quot;immunizations.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216797\"><span class=\"h1\">Why should I get the HPV vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HPV vaccine can help keep you from getting an HPV infection. Being infected with HPV increases your risk of certain cancers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An HPV infection in the genitals can lead to cancer of the cervix (cervical cancer) or vagina (vaginal cancer) in women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>) and cancer of the penis (penile cancer) in men. It can also cause genital warts in women and men.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An HPV infection around the anus (anal cancer) can cause cancer of the anus in women and men. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An HPV infection in the mouth and throat can lead to cancer of the mouth and throat in women and men.</p><p/><p>Most people who have an HPV infection in the genitals or mouth and throat never have problems with cancer. Still, it is hard to know which people will get cancer after an HPV infection. The HPV vaccine is a good way to try to prevent getting infected in the first place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216804\"><span class=\"h1\">How can people get infected with HPV?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can get infected with HPV if their mouths or genitals touch the mouths or genitals of someone who is infected. People who have a lot of sex partners have a higher chance of getting an HPV infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216811\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an HPV infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people do not have any symptoms when they get infected with HPV. And often, the infection will get better on its own. But in some people, the infection doesn't go away. People with a long-lasting HPV infection have a higher chance of getting cervical, vaginal, penile, or anal cancer, mouth or throat cancer, or genital warts. These problems usually happen many years after a person is first infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216818\"><span class=\"h1\">Are different HPV vaccines available?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, 3 different HPV vaccines are available. But they are not all available everywhere, so the one you get will depend on where you live. All HPV vaccines come in shots. The dosing for the shots depends on the person's age:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People younger than 15 should get 2 doses, at least 6 months apart.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People 15 and older should get 3 doses over 6 months.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216825\"><span class=\"h1\">At what age do people get the HPV vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most doctors recommend that people get the HPV vaccine at age 11 or 12. But people can get the vaccine any time from age 9 to 26. Women should not get the vaccine if they are pregnant.</p><p>The HPV vaccine works best when it is given before a person gets infected with HPV. The HPV vaccine can't cure an HPV infection that a person already has. That's why it is better to get the HPV vaccine before you have sex for the first time. If you have already had sex, talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she might recommend that you get the HPV vaccine anyway, because it could still help you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216832\"><span class=\"h1\">What side effects can the HPV vaccine cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HPV vaccine can cause redness, swelling, or soreness where the shot was given. It can also cause people to pass out, but this is uncommon. To make sure that this doesn't happen, your doctor or nurse will have you stay on the exam table for a few minutes after the shot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216839\"><span class=\"h1\">Does the HPV vaccine always work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HPV vaccine is very good at preventing HPV infection and cervical cancer. It might also prevent other cancers, including mouth and throat cancer. But it is not perfect. In some cases, people who get the vaccine can still get an HPV infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216846\"><span class=\"h1\">Does the HPV vaccine prevent other diseases you catch through sex?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. The HPV vaccine does not keep people from getting or spreading other diseases that are spread through sex. To keep from getting or spreading a disease that is spread through sex, you should always use a condom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216853\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to be checked for cervical cancer if I get the vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. All women, including those who get the HPV vaccine, should be checked on a routine schedule for cervical cancer. Most women are checked using a test called a &quot;pap smear&quot; starting at age 21.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22692135\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I have an HPV infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have genital warts, you have an HPV infection. But this is not the same type of HPV that can lead to cancer. If you are a woman, your doctor might check for HPV infection on your pap smear. There are no tests to check for HPV infection in the mouth or throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216860\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anogenital-warts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anogenital warts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cervical cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-warts-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Genital warts in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-treatment-early-stage-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cervical cancer treatment; early-stage cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
