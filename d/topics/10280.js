Obstruction can be caused by invasion or external compression of the SVC by an adjacent pathologic process involving the right lung, lymph nodes, and other mediastinal structures, or by thrombosis of blood within the SVC. In some cases, both external compression and thrombosis coexist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Complications of untreated infection were frequent causes of SVC syndrome (eg, syphilitic thoracic aortic aneurysms) prior to the widespread use of antibiotics. In the postantibiotic era, malignancy became the most common cause, accounting for 90 percent of cases. More recently, the incidence of SVC syndrome due to thrombosis has risen, largely because of increased use of intravascular devices, such as central vein catheters and pacemaker wires. In the present era, benign causes now account for 20 to 40 percent of cases of SVC syndrome.</p><p>This review will focus on the etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of SVC syndrome, emphasizing management in patients with malignancy. The management of central vein thrombosis in the setting of hemodialysis and other indwelling intravascular catheters in patients who do not have cancer is addressed elsewhere.

As the flow of blood within the SVC becomes obstructed, venous collaterals form, establishing alternative pathways for the return of venous blood to the right atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81142\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81142 \">figure 1</a>). Collateral veins may arise from the azygos, internal mammary, lateral thoracic, paraspinous, and esophageal venous systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70515\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70515 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>The venous collaterals dilate over several weeks. As a result, upper body venous pressure is markedly elevated initially but decreases over time. However, even when well-developed collateral drainage patterns are present, central venous pressures remain elevated, producing the characteristic signs and symptoms of SVC syndrome.</p><p>The rapidity of onset of symptoms and signs from SVC obstruction depends upon the rate at which complete obstruction of the SVC occurs in relation to the recruitment of venous collaterals. Patients with malignant disease may develop symptoms of SVC syndrome within weeks to months because rapid tumor growth does not allow adequate time to develop collateral flow. In contrast, fibrosing mediastinitis due to an infection, such as histoplasmosis, may not become symptomatic for years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrosing-mediastinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrosing mediastinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The interstitial edema of the head and neck is visually striking but generally of little clinical consequence. However, edema may narrow the lumen of the nasal passages and larynx, potentially compromising the function of the larynx or pharynx and causing dyspnea, stridor, cough, hoarseness, and dysphagia. In addition, cerebral edema can also occur and lead to cerebral ischemia, herniation, and possibly, death.</p><p>Cardiac output may be diminished transiently by acute SVC obstruction, but within a few hours, blood return is reestablished by increased venous pressure and collaterals. Hemodynamic compromise, if present, more often results from mass effect on the heart than from SVC compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the preantibiotic era, syphilitic thoracic aortic aneurysms, fibrosing mediastinitis, and other complications of untreated infection were frequent causes of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

If the SVC becomes obstructed, blood flows through multiple smaller collaterals to the azygous vein or the inferior vena cava. These venous collaterals dilate over several weeks so that the upper body venous pressure is markedly elevated initially but decreases over time. The severity of symptoms depends on how quickly the SVC obstruction has developed and the degree of narrowing, although acute thrombosis can also occur, causing sudden exacerbation of a partial obstruction.

In addition, patients frequently complain of facial swelling or head fullness, which may be exacerbated by bending forward or lying down. Other symptoms include arm swelling, cough, chest pain, or dysphagia. Patients with cerebral edema may have headaches, confusion, or possibly, coma.</p><p>On physical examination, the most common findings are facial edema and distension of the veins in the neck and on the chest wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76917\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76917 \">picture 1</a>). Arm edema, cyanosis, and facial plethora are less frequent.</p><p>In most cases, symptoms are gradually progressive over several weeks and then get better over time due to the development of venous collaterals.

The most common findings were mediastinal widening and pleural effusion, occurring in 64 and 26 percent of cases, respectively.</p><p>Duplex ultrasound is useful for excluding thrombus in the subclavian, axillary, and brachiocephalic veins and is the initial imaging study for patients with indwelling devices who present with extremity swelling. The SVC cannot be directly imaged using ultrasound due to acoustic shadowing by the overlying ribs. However, indirect findings on duplex ultrasonography that suggest SVC occlusion include dampening of the waveforms of the central upper extremity veins with loss of venous pulsatility and loss of respiratory variation. Thus, for patients with clinical features suggestive of SVC syndrome, particularly those with known malignancy, cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MR]) is a more appropriate initial study.

CT can define the level and extent of venous blockage, can identify and map collateral pathways of venous drainage, and often permits identification of the underlying cause of venous obstruction. The presence of collateral vessels on CT is a strong indicator of SVC syndrome, with a specificity of 96 percent and sensitivity of 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p>Multidetector CT with bilateral upper extremity contrast injection (CT venography) combines the diagnostic benefit of CT with the same degree of enhanced vascular detail as digital venography as long as appropriate techniques for intravenous injection of contrast material are used to minimize flow artifacts arising from unopacified blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Complications, including excessive bleeding from venipuncture sites, are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/5,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35</a>].

Management of central vein thrombosis caused by indwelling venous catheters is addressed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central vein stenosis associated with hemodialysis access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of management for SVC syndrome associated with malignancy are to alleviate symptoms and treat the underlying disease. Treatment of the underlying cause depends upon the type of cancer, the extent of disease, and the overall prognosis, which is closely linked to histology and whether or not prior therapy has been administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These factors all influence the choice of treatment.</p><p>The average life expectancy among patients who present with malignancy-associated SVC syndrome is approximately six months, but there is wide variability depending on the underlying malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/4,7,46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,46-49</a>]. For some patients, treatment of SVC syndrome and its underlying cause results in long-term relapse-free survival and cure. This is most likely to be achieved in chemotherapy-sensitive malignancies using a combined-modality treatment approach.</p><p>Evidence-based guidelines for management of SVC syndrome are not available. A general recommendation supporting radiation therapy (RT) or stent placement for symptomatic SVC syndrome from lung cancer has been made by both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Beyond this, specific recommendations for management are lacking.</p><p>Initial management should be guided by the severity of symptoms and the underlying malignant condition, as well as the anticipated response to treatment. A system for grading the severity of SVC syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72401 \">table 1</a>) and a treatment algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54461\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef54461 \">algorithm 1</a>) based upon the symptom severity and the underlying malignancy have been proposed by clinicians at Yale University [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Need for emergent treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, SVC syndrome due to malignant disease was considered a potentially life-threatening medical emergency requiring immediate RT as the quickest way to relieve the obstruction. Emergency RT is no longer considered necessary for most patients for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic obstruction is often a prolonged process, developing over a period of weeks or longer prior to clinical presentation. The duration of symptoms has no influence on treatment outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Deferring therapy until a full diagnostic work-up has been completed does not pose a hazard for most patients, provided the evaluation is efficient and the patient is clinically stable. This was illustrated in a review of 107 cases of SVC syndrome in which no serious complication resulted from the SVC obstruction itself or investigative procedures leading to the diagnosis, despite a prolonged period between the onset of symptoms and the initiation of therapy in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RT prior to biopsy may obscure the histologic diagnosis. As an example, in one study of 19 patients with symptomatic mediastinal masses who received emergency RT, a histologic diagnosis could not be established in eight (42 percent) from a biopsy obtained after such treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p>Current management guidelines stress the importance of accurate histologic diagnosis prior to starting therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] and the upfront use of endovenous stents in severely symptomatic patients to provide more rapid relief than can be achieved using RT.</p><p>Important exceptions to this general approach are patients who present with stridor due to central airway obstruction or severe laryngeal edema, and those with coma from cerebral edema. <strong>These situations represent a true medical emergency, and these patients require immediate treatment (stent placement and RT) to decrease the risk of sudden respiratory failure and death.</strong> (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of central airway obstruction in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H54801470\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Supportive care and medical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no data documenting the effectiveness of this maneuver, the head should be raised to decrease hydrostatic pressure and head and neck edema.</p><p>Obstruction of blood flow through the SVC slows venous return. This can result in local irritation or thrombosis of veins in the upper extremities, or delayed absorption of drugs from the surrounding tissues. Thus, the use of intramuscular injections in the arms should be avoided.</p><p>For patients who have obstruction of the SVC resulting from intravascular thrombus associated with an indwelling catheter, removal of the catheter is indicated in conjunction with systemic anticoagulation (see below).

Evidence-based guidelines from the ACCP recommend systemic anticoagulation for the treatment of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis and after thrombolysis; they do not specifically address management of SVC syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Glucocorticoids can be effective in reversing symptomatic SVC syndrome caused by steroid-responsive malignancies, such as lymphoma or thymoma. Their effectiveness in patients with SVC obstruction due to other malignancies, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has never been studied, and they are not indicated in these situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In patients undergoing RT, particularly if laryngeal edema is present, glucocorticoids are commonly prescribed to reduce swelling.

In a retrospective series of 107 patients with SVC syndrome from a variety of causes, the rate of clinical improvement was similar among patients receiving glucocorticoids, diuretics, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy for lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and germ cell tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or germ cell cancer (and possibly breast cancer), initial chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic SVC syndrome. In these settings, the clinical response to chemotherapy alone is usually rapid. Furthermore, these patients can often achieve long-term remission and durable palliation with standard treatment regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. When chemotherapy is the initial intervention of choice and the SVC obstruction is unrelieved, chemotherapy should be administered through a dorsal foot vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] or, in the case of antineoplastic vesicants (eg, anthracyclines), via a femoral vein Port-A-Cath.

In a review of treatment for SVC obstruction in patients with lung cancer, chemotherapy alone relieved symptoms of SVC obstruction in 77 percent of those with SCLC, although 17 percent had a later recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

However, in certain situations (eg, limited-stage SCLC, some subtypes of NHL), the addition of RT to systemic chemotherapy may decrease local recurrence rates and improve overall survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=limited-stage-small-cell-lung-cancer-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With these treatment-responsive tumors, presentation with SVC syndrome does not necessarily portend an adverse outcome compared with patients without SVC obstruction. As an example, among patients with SCLC, some series noted paradoxically better survival among those presenting with SVC syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/13,16,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,55</a>], while others found no impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>].</p><p>Among patients with SVC syndrome and NHL, symptoms suggesting involvement of other mediastinal structures (eg, dysphagia, hoarseness, or stridor) and shorter symptom duration appear to be adverse prognostic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-small cell lung cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As compared with more therapy-sensitive SCLC, the degree and rapidity of response to chemotherapy are less in NSCLC.

Although long-term relapse-free survival has been rarely reported in patients with locally advanced disease and SVC syndrome treated with chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] or a combined modality approach that includes both RT and chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], therapy of SVC syndrome in patients with NSCLC is most often directed toward palliation of symptoms rather than long-term remission. For previously unirradiated patients, palliation is most often achieved with external beam irradiation.

In an autopsy series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], complete and partial SVC patency was found in only 14 and 10 percent of patients after RT for SVC syndrome, despite reported relief of symptoms in 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These data have led some to suggest that the development of collateralization may have contributed more to symptomatic improvement than the effect of RT, and to question the value of urgent RT in patients with SVC syndrome from chemotherapy-sensitive malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

A single stent was deployed in 38, while nine (16 percent) required more than one stent to bridge the stenotic area. Patency rates at one year in malignant and benign cases were 64 and 76 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third series included 164 patients with malignant SVC syndrome, with a mean follow-up period of 355 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Endovenous treatment was successful in 95 percent of cases, with an acceptable rate of early mortality (2.4 percent). Thrombosis of the SVC was the only independent factor for endovenous treatment failure. Relapse occurred in 36 patients (21.9 percent, with effective restenting in 75 percent of cases). Recurrence of SVC syndrome was significantly increased in cases of occlusion, initial associated thrombosis, or use of stainless steel stents. Long-term anticoagulation therapy did not influence the risk of recurrence or complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 56 patients with malignant SVC obstruction, the clinical success rate of SVC stenting was 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Success was associated with obstruction type, which was classified as follows: group 1 (a, SVC stenosis; or b, unilateral innominate vein occlusion with contralateral innominate vein stenosis and normal SVC), group 2 (SVC occlusion excluding bilateral innominate vein occlusion), and group 3 (bilateral innominate vein occlusion irrespective of SVC status). Success rates were 100 (39 of 39), 75 (9 of 12), and 17 percent (1 of 6), for the three groups, respectively. These differences were significant for group 1 compared with group 2 and 3, and for group 2 compared with group 3. Acute complications occurred in nine patients. Patients in whom acute complications occurred were older than the others (67.8 versus 57.6 years). The procedure-related death rate was 3.5 percent (n = 2). Stent occlusion occurred in 3.5 percent (n = 2). Patient survival was poor (median 2.6 months; range &lt;1 to 29.6 months), independent of the success of stenting. In this report, stenting for malignant SVC syndrome provided immediate and sustained symptomatic relief, lasting until death in patients with a short life-expectancy, and it restored central venous access for administration of chemotherapy. Technical failure was associated with SVC occlusions and primarily with bilateral innominate vein occlusion.</p><p/><p>Both balloon-expandable (stainless steel, cobalt chromium) and self-expanding (stainless steel, nitinol, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated nitinol) stents have been used for treating SVC syndrome.

The best data on the comparative efficacy of these approaches come from a systematic review of the literature of patients with SVC obstruction due to lung cancer (either SCLC or NSCLC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Of the 159 patients who underwent stent placement, 95 percent had relief of symptoms, and the incidence of reocclusion (usually due to thrombosis or tumor ingrowth into the stent) was only 11 percent. In contrast, of the over 600 patients with SCLC, chemotherapy alone, chemoradiotherapy, and RT resulted in complete or partial relief of symptoms in 84, 94, and 78 percent of cases, respectively. Among 150 patients with NSCLC, approximately 60 percent had relief with chemotherapy or RT. Overall, relapse rates were lower with SVC stenting (11 versus 17 to 19 percent with RT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy) in both SCLC and NSCLC.

However, the benefit of thrombolysis in this setting remains unclear; the risk of hematoma, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemoptysis, and epistaxis are increased.

The majority of cases are due to malignancy, and approximately 95 percent of these are due to lung cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). SVC syndrome can also be caused by benign causes, such as fibrosing mediastinitis and thrombosis associated with intravascular devices. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancy-related SVC syndrome was previously considered a potentially life-threatening medical emergency requiring immediate radiation therapy (RT) to rapidly relieve the obstruction. Emergency RT is no longer considered necessary for most patients. Current management guidelines stress the importance of accurate histologic diagnosis prior to starting therapy and the upfront use of endovenous stents in severely symptomatic patients to provide more rapid symptom relief than can be achieved using RT. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Histologic diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important exceptions to this general approach are patients who present with stridor due to central airway obstruction or severe laryngeal edema causing respiratory compromise, and those with depressed central nervous system status from cerebral edema. These situations represent <strong>true medical emergencies</strong>, and these patients require both endovenous stenting and emergent RT to decrease the risk of sudden respiratory failure and death.

If patients are severely symptomatic, an endovenous stent can be used to provide rapid relief of symptoms.
