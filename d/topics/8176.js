However, some complications, particularly hepatic toxicity, can be quite serious. Fortunately, careful and appropriate patient monitoring can minimize the risk and can allow MTX to remain an important drug in the treatment of rheumatic diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methotrexate-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATOTOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> (MTX) can induce a variety of histologic changes including steatosis, stellate (Ito) cell hypertrophy, anisonucleosis (nuclei of varying sizes), and hepatic fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54948\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54948 \">picture 1</a>). The mechanism by which MTX adversely affects the liver is unclear. Hepatic folate stores are depleted by MTX in the doses used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and these stores can be repleted by short-term administration of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (folinic acid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A relationship between folate depletion and hepatic toxicity has not been established. However, supplementation with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> 1 mg per day or leucovorin 2.5 mg per week is associated with a reduced incidence of serum transaminase elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Thus, folate supplementation may help prevent hepatotoxicity in patients taking MTX but does not substitute for ongoing monitoring and appropriate MTX dose adjustments if transaminase elevation occurs.</p><p>Use of MTX for neoplastic diseases has been associated with abnormalities of liver biochemical tests. The reported incidence of MTX-induced increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is approximately 14 percent, while the incidence of increases into the abnormal range of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The enzymes may rise with each course of MTX and are also higher in patients receiving daily, as opposed to intermittent, dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The abnormal liver enzymes usually resolve within a month of discontinuation of the drug. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemotherapy-hepatotoxicity-and-dose-modification-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemotherapy hepatotoxicity and dose modification in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Methotrexate'</a>.)</p><p>Most of our understanding of the hepatotoxic potential of MTX comes from its use in nonmalignant disease, such as psoriasis and RA. MTX hepatotoxicity in patients with psoriasis appears to increase with the total cumulative dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Cirrhosis and fibrosis occur more than twice as frequently in patients receiving daily MTX therapy when compared with those receiving intermittent dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Early studies from the dermatology literature described severe liver disease, including cirrhosis, in patients with psoriasis who were treated with MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The authors of these studies also noted an inability of liver function testing to predict actual liver toxicity. Thus, in the past, the dermatology community recommended monitoring for liver disease by liver biopsy performed after a total cumulative dose of 1.5 g of MTX and again after each additional 1 g cumulative dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Potential limitations of the studies on which the past recommendations were based included the performance of blood sampling only on the day of the liver biopsy and the lack of control for exposure to other hepatotoxins (such as alcohol and arsenic).</p><p>Guidelines for the monitoring for hepatotoxicity in patients being treated for RA with MTX were adopted when rheumatologists began using MTX for patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and prospective studies were performed in which baseline and multiple liver biopsies were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In contrast to the dermatology studies that performed blood sampling only on the day of liver biopsy, the rheumatology studies measured the serum AST and albumin concentrations at regular and frequent intervals during the period leading up to liver biopsy and between sequential biopsies. Thus, while the dermatology literature concluded that blood sampling was of little value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/6,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9-11</a>], the rheumatology literature observed that elevations of AST into the abnormal range were predictive of abnormal or worsening histological grade on liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Furthermore, little deterioration was noted on serial liver biopsies when the MTX dose was adjusted for abnormalities in serum AST and albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>However, the guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology no longer recommend liver biopsies in all patients administered MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Instead, they recommend liver biopsies based upon the presence of risk factors for hepatotoxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Hepatotoxicity and liver biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>Data from a large cohort of patients with RA (1953 patients) and psoriatic arthritis (151 patients), enrolled in the CORRONA database in the United States, showed an increased risk of transaminase elevations with a combination of MTX and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> compared with either drug used alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The overall incidence of elevations in aminotransferase enzymes in patients with RA receiving MTX, leflunomide, MTX plus leflunomide, and neither was 22, 17, 31, and 14 percent, respectively. Patients with psoriatic arthritis were 2.76-fold (CI 1.84-4.15) more likely to exhibit elevations in these enzymes than patients with RA.</p><p>Other approaches are under development for the detection of changes related to hepatic fibrosis, including noninvasive imaging techniques. As an example, ultrasound-based transient elastography has been used in preliminary studies of patients receiving MTX for inflammatory arthritis, psoriasis, and gastroenterologic disorders but has not been evaluated for its utility in monitoring patients with RA receiving MTX in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-overview-of-serologic-and-radiographic-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: Overview of serologic and radiographic tests&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of interest is the observation that MTX may have beneficial effects in certain autoimmune liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis (previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>) and granulomatous hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. This is not surprising, as MTX has been used in a variety of autoimmune conditions from multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus to inflammatory bowel disease. However, these investigations should not be misinterpreted as showing that MTX is not itself hepatotoxic. Rather, its salutary effects on autoimmune liver disease may outweigh its potential for hepatotoxicity, particularly in short and intermediate term studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before initiating MTX therapy, patients should have a careful history and physical examination with particular emphasis on alcohol intake, potential exposure to viral hepatitis (eg, illicit drug use), and any family history of liver disease. Baseline laboratory studies should include AST, ALT, serum bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, and, in patients with identified risk factors, serologic testing for hepatitis B and C virus infection. A pretreatment liver biopsy should be strongly considered in patients with a history of excessive alcohol consumption, persistently abnormal AST or ALT values, or chronic hepatitis B or C infection.</p><p>Factors associated with an increased risk of hepatic transaminase elevations were evaluated in a study that examined the records of 659 US military veterans age 65 and older who were newly receiving MTX, with mean follow-up of seven months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Moderate AST or ALT elevations (at least 1.5 times the upper limit of normal), which occurred in 45 (6 percent) of the patients, were more likely in patients with obesity, untreated high cholesterol, AST or ALT elevations above the upper limit of normal at baseline (before starting MTX), use of a biologic agent in addition to the MTX, and lack of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation.</p><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are increasingly common. A patient with an elevated body mass index (BMI) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-for-adults-metric-patient-education\" class=\"calc calc_patient\">calculator 1</a>) and increases in transaminase enzymes above the upper limit of normal should have a hepatic ultrasound to determine if the patient may have NAFLD. Although prospective trials of MTX in patients with NAFLD have not been performed, it is likely that the addition of MTX in this setting could accelerate changes to NASH. Therefore, patients with an elevated BMI and transaminase enzyme increases that may be viewed as trivial at baseline should be monitored particularly carefully (monthly) for the evolution of NASH while on MTX. In patients in whom abnormalities persist, the dose of MTX should be lowered, and if the transaminases continue to be elevated despite dose reductions the MTX should be discontinued. The features, diagnosis, and management of NAFLD are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines in RA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the above observations, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has published guidelines for monitoring MTX-induced hepatic toxicity in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. It should be noted, however, that these recommendations are based upon expert opinion. In general agreement with these guidelines, we recommend the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood sampling for measurement of aminotransferases and serum albumin should be obtained at four- to eight-week intervals. The 2008 ACR recommendations indicate that, in patients on a stable dose of MTX, monitoring at an interval of every 8 to 12 weeks is appropriate after three months of therapy and monitoring every 12 weeks can be performed beyond six months of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver biopsy should be performed if 6 of 12 tests are abnormal in any year (or five of nine if testing is performed at six-week instead of monthly intervals). Abnormal aminotransferases are defined as any elevation into the abnormal range, while low serum albumin is defined as a value &le;3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (&le;34 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine monitoring biopsies after a fixed interval or specific cumulative dose of MTX are no longer recommended. A pretreatment biopsy is considered only for patients with a history of excessive prior alcohol consumption, persistently abnormal baseline AST values, or chronic hepatitis B or C infection.</p><p/><p>A key feature of these suggested guidelines that is sometimes overlooked is the need to adjust the MTX dose in the event of an abnormality in AST or a decrease in serum albumin concentration. Thus, after obtaining an abnormal value, the clinician should adjust the weekly dose of MTX downward and should then repeat the blood testing after an interval of two to four weeks to ascertain that the abnormal values have returned to the normal range. MTX should be held in the event of a repeat elevation of transaminase enzymes greater than twice the upper limit of normal for the laboratory in which the test was performed; after holding for 1 to 2 additional weeks, the MTX can then be resumed at a weekly dose that has been reduced by 2.5 to 7.5 mg, if the transaminase values have returned to the normal range. In the event that transaminase enzymes remain elevated, after holding the drug or dose reduction, then other reasons for the elevated transaminases should be sought, including alcohol consumption or concomitant medications. If no other reasons for transaminase enzymes elevations are found and the enzymes remain elevated, then MTX should be discontinued. The same approach is taken for a patient with a baseline normal serum albumin who then develops hypoalbuminemia of &lt;3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span>. This careful monitoring places a great deal of responsibility on the clinician, while making it unlikely that patients should have to undergo a liver biopsy.</p><p>In general, more frequent monitoring than that mentioned in the guidelines should be considered when other potential hepatotoxins are first combined with MTX therapy. These may include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, retinoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>.</p><p>The recommendations contained in the suggested guidelines were derived from published cohorts of patients who did not use alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. These patients, when managed under the recommended guidelines, had a safe long-term outcome with respect to liver toxicity. One study, for example, prospectively evaluated 27 patients with RA who were treated with MTX; no clinically meaningful changes by light or electron microscopy were found in the 170 liver biopsies obtained over a mean of eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>However, alcohol has been identified as a major risk factor for liver disease in patients with psoriasis on MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, it is strongly recommended that patients on MTX therapy be counseled about avoidance of alcohol and that this conversation is documented on the clinic chart. Patients should also be periodically questioned about their adherence to this policy.</p><p>The amount of alcohol which can be safely consumed while on MTX is likely to be highly idiosyncratic and specific to a patient's genetic profile. Occasional and low-level alcohol consumption may be tolerated for some patients, but the specifics of the intake recommendations should be highly individualized and require real-time monitoring of hepatic aminotransferase enzymes for increases into the abnormal range that could reflect an incipient problem. It is best if the clinician has a repeated dialogue with the patient regarding the extent of alcohol consumption so that aminotransferase increases can be considered in the proper context. However, some experts advocate that all patients on MTX should be cautioned that the safest approach is to avoid alcohol altogether, because of the potential risk, variability in individual tolerance, and uncertainty regarding the efficacy of recommendations that permit some alcohol intake. </p><p>To our knowledge, there is only one study that has examined the relationship of the amount of prior alcohol consumption with both transaminase elevations and liver histology from biopsy tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The amount of alcohol intake was related to subtle worsening in hepatic histology in RA patients on weekly MTX, when annual liver biopsies were read in a blinded fashion from sequential samples. There appeared to be a linear correlation with increasing amounts of alcohol from a few drinks per week to daily consumption. There is great variation in the enzymes associated with alcohol metabolism and the intracellular metabolism of MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The clinician is therefore unable to prejudge how much alcohol a particular patient can tolerate while on MTX. An evolving rule of thumb is to recommend no more than two to three drinks per week to start, accompanied by ongoing monitoring of transaminase enzymes and serum albumin with dose adjustments or counseling regarding alcohol avoidance in the event of abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines in other rheumatic diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of the predictive value of serial blood sampling and hepatic histologic outcome have been performed only in patients with RA. It is presently uncertain, because of the absence of data, if serial monitoring of aminotransferases and serum albumin can be universally applied to other groups receiving MTX, such as patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and other vasculitides, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or psoriatic arthritis. As a group, patients with psoriatic arthritis have higher body mass index (BMI) levels and may have an independent risk of steatohepatitis.</p><p>There is some evidence that patients with psoriasis may have an enhanced predisposition to hepatic damage, particularly if they have underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus or are overweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-low-dose-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/9,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,31</a>].
