Despite advances made in the understanding of the pathogenesis and improvements in early recognition and treatment, it remains a devastating event, often producing severe and permanent disability. With a peak incidence in young adults, traumatic spinal cord injury remains a costly problem for society; direct medical expenses accrued over the lifetime of one patient range from 500,000 to 2 million US dollars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews acute traumatic spinal cord injury. The anatomy and clinical localization of spinal cord disease, other diseases affecting the spinal cord, and the chronic complications of spinal cord injury are discussed separately.

In the United States, the incidence of TSCI in 2010 was about 40 per million persons per year, or about 12,400 annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], with approximately 250,000 living survivors of TSCI in the United States in July 2005. Similar figures are reported in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence in the USA is higher than in most other countries. </p><p>The causes of TSCI in the United States are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor vehicle accidents: 48 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falls: 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Violence (especially gunshot wounds): 12 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sports accidents: 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other: 14 percent</p><p/><p>Statistics differ somewhat in other countries. In Canada and western Europe, TSCI due to violence is rare, while in developing countries, violence is even more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Soldiers deployed in armed conflicts also have a substantial risk of TSCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for TSCI have been identified. Prior to 2000, the most frequent victim was a young male with a median age of 22. Since that time, the average age has increased in the United States to 37 years in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], presumably as a reflection of the aging population. Males continue to make up 77 to 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/2,3,5,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,6,8</a>]. Alcohol plays a role in at least 25 percent of TSCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. Underlying spinal disease can make some patients more susceptible to TSCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. These conditions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical spondylosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atlantoaxial instability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital conditions, eg, tethered cord</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoporosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal arthropathies, including ankylosing spondylitis or rheumatoid arthritis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults&quot;, section on 'Neurologic manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-subluxation-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical subluxation in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most spinal cord injuries are produced in association with injury to the vertebral column. These can include any one or more of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fracture of one or more of the bony elements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dislocation at one or more joints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tearing of ligament(s)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disruption <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> herniation of the intervertebral disc</p><p/><p>The injury reflects the force and direction of the traumatic event and subsequent fall, which produces pathologic flexion, rotation, extension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compression of the spine, as well as the anatomic vulnerability of individual spinal elements. Most vertebral injuries in adults involve both fracture and dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The type of injury has implications for the stability of the spinal column and the risk for further spinal cord injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52922 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanisms surrounding injury to the spinal cord itself are often discussed in terms of primary and secondary injury. The primary injury refers to the immediate effect of trauma which includes forces of compression, contusion, and shear injury to the spinal cord. In the absence of cord transection or frank hemorrhage (both relatively rare in nonpenetrating injuries), the spinal cord may appear pathologically normal immediately after trauma. Penetrating injuries (eg, knife and gunshot injuries) usually produce a complete or partial transection of the spinal cord. An increasingly described phenomenon, however, is a spinal cord injury following a gunshot wound that does not enter the spinal canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Presumably, the spinal cord injury in these cases results from kinetic energy emitted by the bullet.</p><p>A secondary, progressive mechanism of cord injury usually follows, beginning within minutes and evolving over several hours after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12-15</a>]. The processes propagating this phenomenon are complex and incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Possible mechanisms include ischemia, hypoxia, inflammation, edema, excitotoxicity, disturbances of ion homeostasis, and apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,18</a>]. The phenomenon of secondary injury is sometimes clinically manifest by neurologic deterioration over the first 8 to 12 hours in patients who initially present with an incomplete cord syndrome.</p><p>As a result of these secondary processes, spinal cord edema develops within hours of injury, becomes maximal between the third and sixth day after injury, and begins to recede after the ninth day. This is gradually replaced by a central hemorrhagic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient with a cord injury typically has pain at the site of the spinal fracture. This is not always a reliable feature to exclude traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI). Patients with TSCI often have associated brain and systemic injuries (eg, hemothorax, extremity fractures, intra-abdominal injury) that may limit the patient's ability to report localized pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. These also complicate the initial evaluation and management of patients with TSCI, and affect prognosis.</p><p>About half of TSCIs involve the cervical cord and as a result present with quadriparesis or quadriplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. The severity of cord syndromes are classified using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60383 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete cord injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a complete cord injury (ASIA grade A), there will be a rostral zone of spared sensory levels (eg, the C5 and higher dermatomes spared in a C5-6 fracture-dislocation), reduced sensation in the next caudal level, and no sensation in levels below, including none in the sacral segments, S4-S5. Similarly, there will be reduced muscle power in the level immediately below the injury, followed by complete paralysis in more caudal myotomes. In the acute stage, reflexes are absent, there is no response to plantar stimulation, and muscle tone is flaccid. A male with a complete TSCI may have priapism. The bulbocavernosus reflex is usually absent. Urinary retention and bladder distension occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Segmental syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Incomplete injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In incomplete injuries (ASIA grades B through D), there are various degrees of motor function in muscles controlled by levels of the spinal cord caudal to the injury. Sensation is also partially preserved in dermatomes below the area of injury. Usually sensation is preserved to a greater extent than motor function because the sensory tracts are located in more peripheral, less vulnerable areas of the cord. The bulbocavernosus reflex and anal sensation are often present.</p><p>The relative incidence of incomplete versus complete spinal cord injury has increased over the last half century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This trend has been attributed to improved initial care and retrieval systems that emphasize the importance of immobilization after injury (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation and treatment'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Central cord syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute central cord syndrome, characterized by disproportionately greater motor impairment in upper compared with lower extremities, bladder dysfunction, and a variable degree of sensory loss below the level of injury, is described after relatively mild trauma in the setting of preexisting cervical spondylosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-spondylotic-myelopathy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical spondylotic myelopathy&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-spondylotic-myelopathy#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical spondylotic myelopathy&quot;, section on 'Acute deterioration'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Central cord syndromes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior cord syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions affecting the anterior or ventral two-thirds of the spinal cord, sparing the dorsal columns, usually reflect injury to the anterior spinal artery. When this occurs in TSCI, it is believed that this more often represents a direct injury to the anterior spinal cord by retropulsed disc or bone fragments rather than primary disruption of the anterior spinal artery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Ventral (anterior) cord syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient paralysis and spinal shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after a spinal cord injury, there may be a physiological loss of all spinal cord function caudal to the level of the injury, with flaccid paralysis, anesthesia, absent bowel and bladder control, and loss of reflex activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In males, especially those with a cervical cord injury, priapism may develop. There may also be bradycardia and hypotension not due to causes other than the spinal cord injury. This altered physiologic state may last several hours to several weeks and is sometimes referred to as spinal shock.</p><p>We believe that this loss of function may be caused by the loss of potassium within the injured cells in the cord and its accumulation within the extra-cellular space, causing reduced axonal transmission. As the potassium levels normalize within the intracellular and extra-cellular spaces, this spinal shock wears off. Clinical manifestations may normalize, but are more usually replaced by a spastic paresis reflecting more severe morphologic injury to the spinal cord.</p><p>A transient paralysis with complete recovery is most often described in younger patients with athletic injuries. These patients should undergo evaluation for underlying spinal disease before returning to play.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION AND TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">In the field</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary assessment of a patient with trauma in the field follows the ABCD prioritization scheme: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability (neurologic status). If the patient has a head injury, is unconscious or confused, or complains of spinal pain, weakness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of sensation, then a traumatic spinal injury should be assumed. Extreme care should be taken to allow as little movement of the spine as possible to prevent more cord injury. Techniques to minimize spine movement include the use of log-roll movements and a backboard for transfer and placement of a rigid cervical collar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This topic is discussed in detail separately.

Life-threatening priorities related to other injuries, such as systemic bleeding, breathing difficulties, or a pneumothorax, can take precedence over the spinal cord injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory status, and temperature require ongoing monitoring. Capnography can provide a useful method of monitoring respiratory status in the emergency department.

Respiratory mechanical support may be needed; about one-third of patients with cervical injuries require intubation within the first 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Rapid-sequence intubation with in-line spinal immobilization is the preferred method when an airway is urgently required. If time is not an issue, intubation over a flexible fiberoptic laryngoscope may be a safer, effective option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxia in the face of cord injury can adversely affect neurologic outcome. Arterial oxygenation should be monitored and supplemented as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension may occur due to blood loss from other injuries or due to blood pooling in the extremities lacking sympathetic tone because of the disruption of the autonomic nervous system (neurogenic shock). Prolonged hypoperfusion may adversely affect prognosis. Elevation of the legs, the head-dependent position, blood replacement, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasoactive agents may be required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Until spinal injury has been ruled out (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below), immobilization of the neck and body must be maintained using cervical collar, straps, tape, and blocks. Athletic headgear should be left on.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A neurologic examination should be completed as soon as possible to determine the level and severity of the injury, both of which impact prognosis and treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Clinical localization'</a>.) An evaluation of mental status and cranial nerve function should be included, as many patients with TSCI have also suffered a head injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient must be checked for bladder distension by palpation or ultrasound. A urinary catheter should be inserted as soon as possible, if not done previously, to avoid harm due to bladder distension.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many centers, a full set of cervical spine films are required on all trauma patients before a cervical collar can be removed. Data from the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) allow this requirement to be modified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients without neurologic deficits, who are alert and not confused, who are not intoxicated, and who have no neck or midline pain or tenderness or other injury that is distracting to the patient are unlikely to have a cervical spine injury. In the NEXUS study, these five criteria had a 99.8 percent negative predictive value for cervical spine injury (sensitivity 99 percent; specificity 12.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similar results have been reported in other large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Patients who are not clinically evaluable for SCI because of obtundation or confusion should be assumed to have a SCI until proven otherwise. In one meta-analysis of studies looking at such patients, the incidence of spine injury was 7.5 percent; 42 percent of these had unstable injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain x-rays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain x-rays provide a rapid assessment of alignment, fractures, and soft tissue swelling and are, in general, the first method of assessment of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI). A complete set of cervical x-rays includes anteroposterior, lateral, and open-mouth odontoid views. Oblique views may be necessary if one suspects a lateral mass or facet injury or damage. All cervical vertebrae and the top of T1 must be visualized. In muscular males with a neck injury, pulling the shoulders down by pulling down on the wrists in a straight line and downward towards the feet may better allow visualization of the lower cervical vertebrae. A swimmer's view should be performed if the lower cervical levels and the top of T1 are not adequately visualized. While there are reports of missed cervical spine injury with plain films, it is rare to miss significant injuries with adequate performance and interpretation of plain films of the occiput through the top of T1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Neurologic signs and symptoms of cervical spine injury in the setting of normal plain x-rays warrant further imaging studies.</p><p>Patients who have pain in the thoracic or lumbar areas, especially with an appropriate neurologic deficit, also require lateral, anteroposterior, and sometimes oblique plain x-rays of either the thoracic spine, lumbar region, or both. Such spinal injuries, especially with a neurologic deficit, require further imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Helical computed tomographic scanning (CT) with coronal and sagittal reconstructions may replace plain films for screening assessment in centers in which it is readily available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Prospective case series report a higher sensitivity for detecting spinal fracture when compared with plain x-rays; this is particularly true for cervical spine fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/31,33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33-37</a>]. This study can also be done without moving the patient out of the supine position. When head CT is required to rule out head injury, it may be most cost and time efficient to use CT as the initial imaging study of the neck as well.</p><p>All abnormalities on screening plain films or CT are followed up with a more detailed CT scan of the area in question, with fine, 2 mm cuts as needed. Areas not well visualized on plain films should be further imaged as well. This test is very sensitive for defining bone fractures in the spine. Because CT is more sensitive than plain films, patients who are suspected to have a spinal injury and have normal plain films should also undergo CT. CT also has advantages over plain films in assessing the patency of the spinal canal. CT also provides some assessment of the paravertebral soft tissues and perhaps of the spinal cord as well, but is inferior in that regard to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Myelography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When MRI is available, myelography is rarely if ever used, but remains an alternative in combination with CT when MRI cannot be performed and spinal canal compromise is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for MRI in the evaluation of acute TSCI have not been defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>The chief advantage of MRI is that it provides a detailed image of the spinal cord as well as spinal ligaments, intervertebral discs, and paraspinal soft tissues that is superior to CT and is more sensitive for detecting epidural hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/38,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40-43</a>]. CT, however, is better than MRI in assessing bony structures. In the absence of a cord transection or intramedullary hemorrhage, MRI is not perfectly sensitive to cord damage in the earliest stages of TSCI. MRI has other disadvantages: it is contraindicated in the setting of a cardiac pacemaker and metallic foreign bodies, life support equipment may be incompatible with the performance of MRI, and the patient is enclosed during the study, which can pose some risk for monitoring vital signs and for maintaining an airway. In some centers, MRI is not always available because of resource and personnel issues.</p><p>Nonetheless, if the patient's clinical status permits, MRI can provide valuable information that complements CT regarding the extent and mechanism of spinal cord injury, which can influence treatment and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/38,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,44,45</a>]. MRI is also indicated in patients with negative CT scan who are suspected to have TSCI, in order to detect occult ligamentous or disc injury or epidural hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a systematic review of reported case series, 5.8 percent of individuals with negative CT scan who went on to have an MRI were found to have a traumatic spine injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. While it has been suggested that nonalert patients require MRI in addition to CT to exclude TSCI, one case series suggests that if obtunded patients are observed to have grossly normal motor movement in all extremities, CT scan is sufficient in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A category of TSCI called spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) originated prior to the use of MRI and referred to patients with a myelopathy without evidence of traumatic vertebral injury on plain x-rays or CT. Because MRI provides superior imaging of the spinal cord, it can detect injuries to the cord that exist despite the apparent absence of bony abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Nevertheless, a number of patients with SCIWORA also have no detectable lesion on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>A common explanation for this phenomenon is transient ligamentous deformation with spontaneous reduction. This is more often described in children who have weak paraspinal muscles, elastic spinal ligaments, and lax soft tissues, which fail to protect the spinal cord from force, but has also been described in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children#H26107899\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) in children&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spinal column injuries in adults&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for ligamentous injury and SCIWORA'</a>.) </p><p>Other possible mechanisms for SCIWORA include radiographically occult intervertebral disc herniation, epidural or intramedullary hemorrhage, fibrocartilaginous emboli from an intervertebral disc that has ruptured into the radicular artery, and traumatic aortic dissection with spinal cord infarction. MRI is invaluable for the diagnosis of these conditions.</p><p>Diagnostic evaluation of this phenomenon in the obtunded patient is discussed in detail separately.

Patients with TSCI may also suffer from hemodynamic shock related to blood loss and other complications. An adequate blood pressure is believed to be critical in maintaining adequate perfusion to the injured spinal cord and thereby limiting secondary ischemic injury. Albeit with little empiric supporting data, guidelines currently recommend maintaining mean arterial pressures of at least 85 to 90 mmHg, using intravenous fluids, transfusion, and pharmacologic vasopressors as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>]. Maintenance of blood pressure intraoperatively is also important.

Excess fluids cause further cord swelling and increased damage.

The incidence of these complications is highest with higher cervical lesions (up to 84 percent), but they are also common with thoracic lesions (65 percent).</p><p>Weakness of the diaphragm and chest wall muscles leads to impaired clearance of secretions, ineffective cough, atelectasis, and hypoventilation.

Backboards should be used only to transport patients with potentially unstable spinal injury and discontinued as soon as possible.

All 499 patients received an initial IV bolus of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> methylprednisolone and were treated within eight hours of TSCI. For patients treated within three hours, there was no difference in outcomes among treatment groups at one year. For patients treated between three to eight hours, 48 hours of methylprednisolone was associated with a greater motor but not functional recovery, compared with other treatments. Patients who received the longer duration infusion of methylprednisolone had more severe sepsis and severe pneumonia compared with the shorter duration of infusion; mortality was similar in all treatment groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p/><p>A meta-analysis of NASCIS II with two other small trials (one positive and one negative) concluded that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> administered within eight hours of spinal cord injury resulted in improved motor recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Many clinicians have raised concern about complications of high dose glucocorticoid therapy, particularly infections, in this setting. However, in the Surgical Timing in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (STASCIS), a nonrandomized prospective cohort study, patients who suffered a complication were less likely to have received glucocorticoid therapy on presentation than those who did not receive glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In addition, glucocorticoid therapy was associated with better neurologic outcomes regardless of the timing of surgical intervention.</p><p>While administration of glucocorticoids has become a standard treatment in many centers for patients with acute TSCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], other experts are unconvinced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/79-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-82</a>]. The beneficial effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> compared with placebo is seen as linked to a post hoc subgroup analysis in one study (NASCIS II), although the investigators assert that early versus late treatment was an a priori hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/80,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,83</a>]. The cut-off times of eight hours and three hours have been seen as arbitrary. Actual gain in motor scores seen in treated patients can be interpreted as marginal.

Most of the recommendations for no use of steroids are based on meta-analyses of previous reports rather than on carefully controlled case series.

There are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the indications for or timing of surgery in TSCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. In general, the specific management of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine and spinal cord injuries depends to a large extent on a surgeon's personal experience and practice norms in his or her center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25317529\"><span class=\"h4\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for cervical spine surgery include significant cord compression with neurologic deficits, especially those that are progressive, that are not amenable or do not respond to closed reduction, or an unstable vertebral fracture or dislocation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52922 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Neurologically intact patients are treated nonoperatively unless there is instability of the vertebral column. Most penetrating injuries require surgical exploration to ensure that there are no foreign bodies imbedded in the tissue, and also to clean the wound to prevent infection.<br/><br/>Defining surgical indications for closed thoracolumbar fractures has been somewhat more challenging, in part because of difficulties defining spinal instability in these lesions. The Denis anatomic-based classification based on a three-column model of spinal stability has somewhat limited clinical utility, as it does not clearly accommodate all fracture types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. The Thoracolumbar Injury Severity Score has been proposed as an alternative and uses a scoring system of three variables: the morphology of the injury, the integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex, and the neurologic status of the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82245\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82245 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>]. A total score of less than four indicates a nonoperative injury; more than four, an operative injury; and four, an injury that is operative at the surgeon's discretion. This algorithm has good intrarater and interrater reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. The clinical efficacy of the algorithm itself remains to be prospectively evaluated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25317560\"><span class=\"h4\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of surgical intervention is not defined and remains somewhat controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Animal and some clinical studies suggest that early relief of spinal cord compression (within eight hours) leads to a better neurologic outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/18,104-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,104-108</a>]. However, older clinical reports suggested that early surgery led to increased medical complications and poorer neurologic outcome, perhaps as a reflection of the vulnerability of the acutely injured cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/109-111\" class=\"abstract_t\">109-111</a>]. More contemporary studies suggest that medical complication rates are actually lower in patients who undergo early surgery, which allows for earlier mobilization and reduced length of intensive care unit and hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/112-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">112-118</a>].</p><p>One trial randomly assigned patients with complete or incomplete cervical TSCI to &quot;early&quot; (within 72 hours) or &quot;late&quot; (more than five days) surgery and found no significant difference in the improvement of American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade or motor scores between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. A systematic review analyzed published data regarding the timing of surgical decompression and concluded that early decompression, within 72 hours, can be performed safely, without increasing systemic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. An impact on neurologic outcome of early versus late surgery could not be determined from the available data. It may be that 72 hours represents too late a cut-off time to define early surgery.</p><p>A meta-analysis that included patients from nonrandomized case series compared neurologic outcomes in 1687 patients with TSCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Those who received decompressive surgery within 24 hours had a better outcome than either those treated conservatively or with delayed surgery. An analysis of homogeneity suggested that the data in this analysis was not reliable for patients with complete TSCI. The subsequently published, nonrandomized, Surgical Timing in Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (STASCIS), compared outcomes in those who received surgery within 24 hours (mean 14.2 hours) after injury to those whose surgery was performed later (mean 48.3 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. After adjusting for glucocorticoid treatment and injury severity, there was a 2.8 fold higher odds in improved outcomes with early surgery. Mortality and complications were similar in both patient groups.</p><p>Most clinicians consider deteriorating neurologic function after incomplete TSCI to be an indication to perform surgery as early as possible if there are no contraindications (eg, hemorrhagic shock, blood dyscrasias).</p><p>The role of early surgery with a complete TSCI (ASIA grade A) is debatable given the overall poor prognosis of these patients. While many surgeons operate to stabilize the spine, most defer the surgery to a less immediate time frame. However, many series show that a small percentage of these patients can improve, and it is possible that potential benefits for surgical decompression in this group may be maximized by earlier rather than later surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>In a 2010 survey of spine surgeons, the majority (&gt;80 percent of 971 respondents) reported a preference to decompress the spine within 24 hours of TSCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Shorter time intervals (within 6 to 12 hours) are preferred by the majority of surgeons for certain lesions, including incomplete cervical TSCI. A 2011 report of an expert panel concurred with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25317567\"><span class=\"h4\">Technical aspects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all surgical cases require decompression, and not all decompression cases require instrumentation and fusion. The technical aspects of the surgery are tailored to the individual case.</p><p>In the case of a cervical fracture with a cervical spinal cord injury, the anesthesiologist usually performs a fiberoptic intubation, done with the patient awake to reduce any further cord injury that potentially could be caused by a regular intubation with neck movement and extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. There is a risk for regurgitation and aspiration with the patient in a head-dependent position. Anesthetists are also usually involved in the postoperative care of patients with TSCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Investigational treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of strategies are being investigated as potential treatments of acute TSCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], but are not currently recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].
