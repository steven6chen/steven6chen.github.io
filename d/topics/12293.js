These networks undergo extensive budding and branching, and associate themselves with vascular smooth muscle elements in a process termed angiogenesis, thus yielding an extensive vasculature capable of responding to systemic as well as local tissue needs. The end result is that each cell is supported by a capillary network that enables it to receive necessary nutrients and oxygen, and export its cellular products (eg, hormones, vasoactive materials, metabolic waste products).</p><p>Following embryogenesis, angiogenesis is repeated during tissue repair (eg, wound healing) and overall growth of the organism. Angiogenesis also occurs during certain specialized situations such as during the menstrual cycle and implantation of the embryo during pregnancy, and can be highly coordinated with hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Alterations in normal or newly formed vascular networks can also be associated with disease, as illustrated by the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occlusion of blood vessels can result in tissue hypoxia and damage (eg, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interference with the action of vascular endothelial growth factor and placental growth factor may play a central role in the placental hypoperfusion seen in preeclampsia.

The general approaches for inhibiting angiogenesis in the treatment of malignancy will be discussed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The toxicity of anti-angiogenic drugs is discussed separately.

Many, but not all of the growth factors that stimulate angiogenesis bind heparin. The biologic counterpart of this property is the ability to bind to structurally similar glycosaminoglycans known as heparan sulfates on cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Binding of a growth factor to heparan sulfate typically stabilizes the growth factor, prolongs its tissue half-life, and may facilitate its binding to specific high affinity receptors.</p><p>Growth factors are a broad category of endogenous molecules that promote cell proliferation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> differentiation. All growth factors that induce neovascularization are presumed to do so by stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Other contributory factors include stimulation of ECM breakdown, attraction of pericytes and macrophages, stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, formation and &quot;sealing&quot; of new vascular structures, and deposition of new matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The ability of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, and transcription factors such as hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1) to increase the rate of endothelial cell proliferation has been demonstrated in several animal models; proliferation is largely limited to ischemic zones, even following systemic administration or activation of these factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. The mechanism that limits their action to ischemic areas is not clear, but it may involve spatially limited expression of high affinity growth factor receptors, a local interplay of growth factors and ECM-derived angiogenic inhibitors, and the presence or absence of other regulatory molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Angiopoietins are a subset of growth factors identified for their role in angiogenesis. Specific angiopoietins (eg, angiopoietin-1) appear to regulate endothelial cell survival as well as interactions with supporting pericytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, the capacity of tissues to respond to angiogenic signaling may be regulated by changes in the composition of the ECM, including expression of matrix-digesting enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Changes in endothelial cell expression of integral matrix proteins (eg, avb3 and avb5 integrins) and heparan sulfate-carrying proteoglycans (such as syndecans) may also be important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-angiogenesis-for-management-of-refractory-angina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic angiogenesis for management of refractory angina&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The existence of both positive and negative angiogenesis regulators has led to two separate strategies for inhibiting pathologic angiogenesis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of positively-acting agents (eg, small molecule VEGF receptor [VEGFR] inhibitors; antibodies; soluble receptor extracellular domains directed against VEGF, VEGFR, or endothelial cell surface proteins; inhibitors of angiopoietin pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]).

This strategy remains experimental. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Other antiangiogenesis approaches'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dominant growth factor controlling angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A, previously called vascular permeability factor [VPF]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. VEGF-A is one member of the VEGF family, which also contains VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, orf virus VEGF (VEGF-E), and placental growth factor (PLGF).</p><p>VEGF-A is the most studied and pharmacologically targeted VEGF family member for pathologic angiogenesis. VEGF-A is produced by a number of different cell types (eg, diverse epithelial lineages, inflammatory and hematopoietic cells, endothelial cells themselves), acts selectively on vascular endothelial cells, and is capable of stimulating angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. As such, it appears to play an active role in the induction, maintenance, and growth of vascular endothelial cells. Because of its association with both normal and abnormal angiogenesis, VEGF-A has become an attractive target for both proangiogenic and antiangiogenic therapy. Direct actions of VEGF-A include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation of endothelial mitogenesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promotion of endothelial survival by an Akt-dependent pathway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of vascular permeability; VEGF-A is 50,000 times more potent in inducing vascular leakage than histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The mechanism of this effect appears to be fenestration of the endothelium of small venules and capillaries through a Src kinase-dependent mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased expression of tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase plasminogen activator, collagenases, and matrix metalloproteinases.

The regulation of VEGF-A expression by hypoxia is mediated by a family of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), which increase transcription of the VEGF gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. In addition, hypoxia also upregulates VEGF levels by stabilizing VEGF messenger RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], as well as through multiple mechanisms not involving HIF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-erythropoiesis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of erythropoiesis&quot;, section on 'Hypoxia-inducible factor and the response to hypoxia'</a>.)</p><p>Cytokines such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and other influences (eg, p53 expression) may also increase VEGF expression by a number of different mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/43-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-47</a>]. Conversely, the antiangiogenic (and antitumor) properties of interferon alfa may be mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of VEGF gene transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">VEGF-A gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The VEGF-A gene undergoes extensive differential splicing amongst its 8 exons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The biological activity, expression patterns, and binding to heparin and extracellular matrix isoforms differ considerably among these isoforms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The smaller VEGF isoforms are secreted in a soluble form, whereas the larger ones are typically matrix-associated. Bioavailability of the larger isoforms is regulated by proteolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Genetic variability in the promoter regions of VEGF affects the activity and expression of the VEGF protein, and may also affect the benefit of VEGF inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">VEGF receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VEGFs mediate angiogenic signals to the vascular endothelium via high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases, designated VEGFR-1 (Flt1), VEGFR-2 <span class=\"nowrap\">(Flk1/KDR),</span> and VEGFR-3 (Flt4). These receptors, which are expressed almost exclusively on endothelial cells, are characterized by seven immunoglobulin-like domains in their extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Neuropilin-1, a cell surface glycoprotein originally implicated as a semaphorin receptor controlling developmental axon guidance, also functions as a nonclassical VEGF receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. It binds to exon 7 of the splice variant VEGF<sub>165</sub> as opposed to the more N-terminal motifs of VEGF recognized by the classical VEGF receptors Flk1 and Flt1. Neuropilin-1 has been proposed to function as a co-receptor for VEGFR-2 capable of enhancing the biological effect of VEGF<sub>165</sub> on endothelial cells; a related receptor, Neuropilin-2, has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H946882\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential expression of VEGF receptors on tip cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heterogeneity exists among endothelial cell populations, in which the cell at the leading edge of an angiogenic sprout (&quot;endothelial tip cell&quot;) is both phenotypically and functionally distinct from the remainder of the trailing endothelium comprising the remainder of the sprout (&quot;stalk cells&quot;). Tip cells are primarily responsible for sensing chemo-attractive VEGF gradients secreted by hypoxic tissue. Moreover, tip cells express high levels of VEGFR3 and <strong>D</strong>e<strong>L</strong>ta-<strong>L</strong>ike 4 (DLL4), while the stalk cells express high levels of Jagged and Notch, with paracrine signaling between tip and stalk cells reinforcing these phenotypic differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Conceivably, pharmacologic inhibition directed solely against tip cells could offer highly selective anti-angiogenic benefits.

VEGF-A mRNA and protein are markedly upregulated in the vast majority of human tumors. VEGF-A in tumors can be produced by tumor cells, stroma, and endothelial cells, consistent with autocrine and paracrine modes of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. In some tumors, VEGF-A overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival.

The concept of an &quot;angiogenic switch&quot; has been proposed, whereby, as the tumor grows and cells in the center of the tumor become hypoxic, the tumor initiates recruitment of its own blood supply, by shifting the balance between angiogenesis inhibitors and stimulators towards the latter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Thus, neovascularization both precedes and is necessary for tumor progression and metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p>Mechanistically, the development of tumor blood vasculature is complex, involving the growth of blood vessels into initially avascular tumor masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>], early co-option of vasculature from neighboring tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], as well as a contribution from circulating endothelial stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].

It has been proposed that VEGF blockade results in a temporary and paradoxical &quot;normalization&quot; of tumor vasculature, with selective pruning of poorly formed vessels and a resulting temporary improvement of blood flow and oxygen delivery to the tumor, which in turn enhances chemotherapy delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-angiogenesis-inhibitors/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>].</p><p>Inhibition of VEGF-A and its activity as a vascular permeability factor is postulated to reduce vessel leakiness and thus tumor interstitial pressure. The net effect of improved tumor blood flow and reduced tumor interstitial pressure is enhanced delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the tumor cells.
