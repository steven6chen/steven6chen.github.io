It is classified based upon the mechanism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary adrenal insufficiency results from disease intrinsic to the adrenal cortex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81494 \">table 1</a>). These patients may present with glucocorticoid deficiency, with or without deficiencies of mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central adrenal insufficiency is caused by impaired production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). It can be caused by either pituitary disease that impairs release of ACTH, or by interference with corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) production from the hypothalamus. These patients have only glucocorticoid deficiency and not mineralocorticoid deficiency. In addition, they may have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, depending on the underlying central nervous system disease.</p><p/><p>The causes and clinical manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency will be discussed in this topic review. The central (secondary and tertiary) causes of adrenal insufficiency are discussed elsewhere in the program (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of central adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;</a>). The diagnosis and treatment of adrenal insufficiency is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of primary adrenal insufficiency vary depending on what class(es) of hormone are deficient and the severity of the defect(s). The adrenal hormones are divided into glucocorticoids (eg, cortisol), mineralocorticoids (eg, aldosterone), and adrenal androgens (eg, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]).</p><p>In general, clinical findings of children with primary adrenal insufficiency include fatigue and gastrointestinal complaints of nausea and vomiting. Additional symptoms can be categorized based upon the specific hormones affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66355\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66355 \">table 2</a>). The underlying cause of adrenal insufficiency determines the type and extent of the deficiency. </p><p>In disorders due to end-organ unresponsiveness, clinical manifestations are similar to those seen in the primary deficiency of the specific hormone (eg, cortisol or aldosterone). (See <a href=\"#H23014111\" class=\"local\">'End-organ unresponsiveness'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical findings associated with glucocorticoid (eg, cortisol) deficiency include fatigue, nausea, fasting hypoglycemia, increased insulin sensitivity, muscle weakness, and morning headache. As a consequence of cortisol deficiency, there also is increased production of pro-opiomelanocortin, which is a prohormone that is cleaved into equimolar amounts of the biologically active hormones adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), and others. The elevated MSH results in increased melanin synthesis, causing hyperpigmentation. This is most conspicuous in areas exposed to sunlight or pressure (eg, elbows and knees) and also is prominent in the areas not typically exposed to sun, such as palmar creases, axillae, tongue, palate, gingival borders, and scars.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mineralocorticoid deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical findings with mineralocorticoid (eg, aldosterone) deficiency primarily result from urinary sodium loss. These most commonly include hypotension, dizziness, salt-craving, weight loss, anorexia, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenal androgen deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adrenal cortex is the major source of androgen precursor production in pubertal children and females of all ages. Clinical findings of adrenal androgen deficiency include decreased or absent axillary and pubic hair as well as a loss in libido. By comparison, clinical findings are unusual in pubertal and adult males, as most of their androgen production occurs in the testes. Prepubertal children with adrenal androgen deficiency are asymptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenal crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The syndrome of adrenal crisis results from acute adrenal insufficiency. In children, the predominant clinical features are hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities resulting from deficiency of mineralocorticoids. These features are more prominent and life-threatening than the symptoms of glucocorticoid deficiency. However, typically both hormones are deficient and contribute to the clinical presentation. Shock may occur in severe cases, which can be fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A rapid overview of this issue can be found in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61357 \">table 3</a>). The rare patient with ACTH resistance may have acute life-threatening decompensation due to cortisol deficiency, and such cases do not typically exhibit the dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities described above.</p><p>Adrenal crisis can occur in children with primary adrenal insufficiency because of either congenital (eg, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, CAH) or acquired causes (eg, bilateral adrenal hemorrhage). It can be observed as the initial presentation of adrenal insufficiency or as the result of inadequate replacement therapy or inadequate stress coverage in patients with known adrenal insufficiency.</p><p>To minimize morbidity and mortality, prompt recognition and treatment of adrenal crisis is critical. Adrenal crisis should be specifically considered in the following clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In neonates, adrenal crisis presents within the first few days to weeks of life. CAH resulting from CYP21A2 (21-hydroxylase) deficiency is the most common cause, although other forms of CAH as well as adrenal hypoplasia congenita and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage present with sodium loss and hypoglycemia that can escalate to adrenal crisis. Identification of patients prior to developing circulatory collapse is imperative. Clinical manifestations of the crisis include vomiting, diarrhea, hypovolemia and hypotension, with associated hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia. In girls, CAH is suggested by varying degrees of masculinization of the external genitalia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-clinical-presentation-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and clinical presentation of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenal crisis in infants and older children previously diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency presents with weight loss, serum electrolyte abnormalities (including hyponatremia and hyperkalemia). There is often a history of an antecedent precipitating stress (eg, surgery or infection). Hyperpigmentation of the skin may be present if the patient has chronic adrenal insufficiency. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage or infarction should be considered in children with hypotension and shock that fail to respond to vigorous fluid resuscitation and inotropic medications. Adrenal crisis is further suggested by the presence of significant hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage can be seen in newborn infants after traumatic delivery, in patients with septic shock, or those receiving anticoagulant therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22511110\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A salt-losing crisis with vomiting, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia also can be seen in infants with obstructive uropathy, pyelonephritis, or tubulointerstitial nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is caused by secondary aldosterone resistance due to the renal disease and is more likely to occur in infants as compared with older children. The possibility of pyelonephritis should be excluded by a rapid test (eg, a urinalysis) in any infant presenting with a salt-losing crisis, particularly beyond the neonatal period when adrenal crisis tends to present. In addition, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia may result from chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). However, patients with CRI usually have increased intravascular volume rather than the dehydration typical of adrenal insufficiency. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of primary adrenal insufficiency can be classified based upon pathophysiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81494 \">table 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroidogenesis disorders &ndash; Defects within the biosynthetic pathways of glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mineralocorticoids lead to impaired synthesis of cortisol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aldosterone. This category includes congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Adrenal insufficiency also may develop in the setting of mitochondrial disorders such as Kearns Sayre syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of primary adrenal insufficiency in children is unknown. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which occurs in approximately 1 of 14,200 live births, is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency. </p><p>In a retrospective review of 103 children with primary adrenal insufficiency, the following causes were identified: CAH (73 percent), autoimmune adrenal failure (13 percent), peroxisomal disorders (5 percent), lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (Wolman disease, 3 percent), adrenal hypoplasia congenita (1 percent), Triple A syndrome (1 percent), and no identifiable cause (6 percent). In this report, the relatively high prevalence of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency was a result of the inclusion of two consanguineous families. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DISORDERS OF STEROIDOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic mutations of the enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways of the adrenocortical hormones result in the decreased production of glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mineralocorticoids. Steroidogenic disorders of cortisol (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) are major causes of primary adrenal insufficiency in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inherited defects in the enzymatic steps of cortisol biosynthesis (steroidogenesis) result in disease states termed congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79609 \">figure 1</a>). These disorders cause primary adrenal insufficiency, as they impair cortisol synthesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76865\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76865 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>The resulting decrease in cortisol levels increases the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thereby stimulating the production of adrenal steroids up to and including the substrate for the defective enzyme. This chronic ACTH stimulation results in hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-steroid-biosynthesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenal steroid biosynthesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of these disorders are related to one or more of the following pathologic processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired synthesis of cortisol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired synthesis of aldosterone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive synthesis of precursor steroids because of the increase in ACTH secretion, which leads to oversecretion of steroids whose production does not require the deficient enzyme. These are most commonly androgenic hormones, which cause virilization. In some forms of CAH, there is excessive synthesis of mineralocorticoids such as deoxycorticosterone, which can cause hypertension.</p><p/><p>The following is a brief review of the various forms of CAH based upon their enzymatic defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79609 \">figure 1</a>), each of which is discussed in detail elsewhere.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>21-hydroxylase deficiency &ndash; 21-hydroxylase deficiency (due to mutations in the <em>CYP21A2</em> gene) is one of the most common inherited diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79609 \">figure 1</a>). It accounts for more than 95 percent of cases of adrenal steroidogenic defects and is estimated to occur in one in 14,200 live births. CYP21A2 deficiency usually presents as one of two clinical syndromes in neonates or very young infants, both of which are associated with glucocorticoid deficiency: a salt-wasting form (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension on account of mineralocorticoid deficiency) with ambiguous genitalia in affected females (because of adrenal androgen excess), and a simple virilizing form in affected males and females without salt wasting. In some infants, the distinction between the two forms is not clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-clinical-presentation-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and clinical presentation of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency &ndash; 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency (due to mutations in the <em>CYP11B1 </em>gene) accounts for less than 5 percent of CAH cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79609 \">figure 1</a>). As with other causes of CAH, cortisol synthesis is reduced; however, there is excessive mineralocorticoid (deoxycorticosterone, DOC) accompanying adrenal androgen overproduction. As a result, patients are hypertensive because of increased sodium retention, and there is virilization of affected females. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias#H93046139\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon congenital adrenal hyperplasias&quot;, section on '11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency &ndash; 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (due to mutations in the <em>CYP17A1</em> gene) is a rare form of CAH. Patients usually have both 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase deficiencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79609 \">figure 1</a>). Although sufficient cortisol is not produced, large quantities of corticosterone (a steroid with both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activities) are synthesized, reducing the symptoms associated with cortisol deficiency. There is also excess production of DOC, resulting in hypertension. In addition, given that both androgen and estrogen synthesis are impaired, affected male patients have female external genitalia and a blind vagina, and affected females have primary amenorrhea and absent secondary sexual characteristics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias#H1698113\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon congenital adrenal hyperplasias&quot;, section on 'CYP17A1 deficiencies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3-Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 2 deficiency &ndash; 3-Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 2 (due to mutations in the <em>HSD3B2</em> gene) is a rare form of CAH in which synthesis of all steroid hormones is impaired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79609 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, there are deficiencies of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and active androgens. Most patients present as neonates or in early infancy. Clinical manifestations are because of both cortisol and aldosterone deficiency, including feeding difficulties, vomiting, volume depletion, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Affected females may have mild virilization (an indirect effect of oversecretion of dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) and males have varying degrees of failure of normal genital development, ranging from hypospadias to more severe ambiguity of the external genitalia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias#H159859022\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon congenital adrenal hyperplasias&quot;, section on '3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia &ndash; Congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia is the most rare and usually the most severe form of CAH. Defects in the StAR (Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) or the <em>CYP11A1</em> gene result in an inability to convert cholesterol to pregnenolone, thereby precluding the biosynthesis of all the major adrenal steroids. The adrenal glands are filled with lipid granules. Patients present as neonates or young infants with symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, including poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, volume depletion, respiratory distress, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. Affected male infants usually have female external genitalia because of the lack of testicular androgen production, and affected female infants have normally developed genitalia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasias#H2642991429\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon congenital adrenal hyperplasias&quot;, section on 'Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>P450 oxidoreductase deficiency &ndash; P450 oxidoreductase deficiency, a rare variant, is also known as apparent combined CYP21A2 and CYP17A1 deficiency, but mutations in the <em>CYP17</em> and <em>CYP21A2</em> genes have not been identified in affected individuals. The underlying defect is a mutation in the <em>POR</em> gene that encodes cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, an enzyme that transfers electrons to CYP21A2 and CYP17A1. This results in a partial deficiency of the enzymes 21-hydroxylase and 17-alpha-hydroxylase. Affected girls are born with ambiguous genitalia, suggesting intrauterine androgen excess; however, as opposed to classic CAH, after birth serum androgen concentrations are low, and virilization does not progress. Boys may have undervirilization. Mothers may have virilization during pregnancy with an affected fetus. Bone malformations affecting primarily the head and limbs (Antley-Bixler syndrome) may be seen in both boys and girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Given that ACTH is not stimulated, these isolated defects do not cause the hyperplasia of the adrenal glands seen in CAH.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aldosterone synthase defects &ndash; aldosterone synthase (encoded by the <em>CYP11B2</em> gene) which is the terminal enzyme in the aldosterone biosynthetic pathway. Mutations in this gene impair the production of aldosterone by altering either hydroxylation (aldosterone synthase deficiency Type 1) or oxidation (aldosterone synthase deficiency type 2) of the 18-carbon position of corticosterone. Patients with either type usually present in infancy with symptoms typical of aldosterone deficiency. These include dehydration, salt-wasting with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, and failure to thrive.

Neurologic impairment is observed in most peroxisomal disorders.

Adrenal failure may predate, occur simultaneously with, or follow the onset of the neurologic deterioration.</p><p>Several clinical phenotypes have been described in boys and men with X-linked ALD.

The autosomal recessive form is lifelong and more severe (also associated with lower respiratory tract disease) and due to loss-of-function mutations in the epithelial sodium channel, while the autosomal dominant form is usually due to inactivating mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor. Patients with autosomal recessive PHA1 typically present in infancy with clinical manifestations similar to those with mineralocorticoid deficiency (sodium wasting with hypovolemia and hyperkalemia) except for increased levels of plasma and urinary aldosterone.
