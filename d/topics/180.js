They can be located anywhere in the body, single or multiple, and congenital or acquired (eg, trauma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68547\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68547 \">table 1</a>). Acquired AVF of the lower extremity is by far the most commonly occurring AVF due to the frequency of the groin as a site for percutaneous arterial and venous access.</p><p>AVFs of the lower extremity will be reviewed here. AVFs affecting other sites, such as the brain and lungs, and patent ductus arteriosus are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-malformations-of-the-central-nervous-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular malformations of the central nervous system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-arteriovenous-malformations-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathology-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations: Epidemiology, etiology, and pathology in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-term-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in term infants, children, and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94699883\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Throughout the body, arteries and veins are closely associated with one another. Most arteries have laterally paired veins which have intervenous communications (ie, venae comitantes) that pass anterior or posterior to the artery. Larger arteries may have one closely associated vein, or the second vein may be diminutive in size. Venous tributaries also often pass anterior to the artery before emptying into a larger vein.</p><p>Any device, implement or projectile that traverses an artery and vein has the potential to lead to AVF. The direction may be from artery to vein or vein to artery. During percutaneous access, lateral or medial needle deviation or needle placement through vena comitantes or venous tributary can lead to combined artery and vein puncture. In many cases, the errant needle placement is noticed (eg, dark blood during arterial puncture, pulsatile blood during venous puncture) and the needle is withdrawn. In most cases, the communication between the artery and vein will spontaneously seal. However, in the face of certain risk factors, the communication between the artery and vein may not seal and AVF will result. </p><p>Long-standing AVFs can lead to limb edema, high-output cardiac failure, or aneurysmal degeneration of the artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Large common femoral AVFs can result in hemodynamic shifts due to the diversion of blood from the high resistance arterial circulation to the low resistance venous circuit. The shunt increases venous volume and pressure and decreases peripheral vascular resistance. The ensuing increase in stroke volume and heart rate may lead to a dramatic rise in cardiac output. Another consequence of high flow AVF is reduced blood flow to the lower extremity, which, in the face of pre-existing peripheral artery disease (PAD), can lead to the onset or worsening of lower extremity ischemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94700565\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula include female gender, hypertension, anticoagulation or antifibrinolytic therapy, left-sided punctures, punctures at low sites, or multiple punctures, increased body mass index and advanced patient age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. Operator-dependent factors that can be modified include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low groin puncture &ndash; Low groin puncture is more likely to access the deep or superficial femoral artery just distal to the common femoral artery bifurcation. The profunda femoris vein passes between the superficial femoral artery and the profunda femoris artery to drain into the common femoral vein. Punctures to the proximal SFA are particularly vulnerable to causing AVF because the needle tip frequently punctures the underlying profunda vein. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of femoral venous catheters&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sheath placement &ndash; Dilation of the tract between an artery and vein reduces the likelihood that the communication will close. The larger the sheath size, the greater the risk for AVF. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the lower extremity, AVF is most commonly iatrogenic, primarily due to arterial access in the groin for percutaneous cardiovascular procedures. Although less common, iatrogenic AVF can result from endoluminal manipulation. Devices that have led to AVF include endovenous laser for saphenous ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], percutaneous directional atherectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and devices used for re-entry during subintimal angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Penetrating trauma can cause AVF anywhere in the extremity depending upon the trajectory of the missile or implement. Rarely, AVF may be due to central venous access procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94699890\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous groin access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of AVF following percutaneous groin access varies from 0.006 to 0.88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/2,7,8,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8,16,17</a>]. Distal groin puncture is the main cause of post-catheterization AVFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The incidence is higher in therapeutic compared with diagnostic catheterization (0.87 versus 0.15 percent in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. The presence of one or more risk factors increases the potential that combined artery and venous puncture will result in a clinically important AVF. (See <a href=\"#H94700565\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Although the use of arterial closure devices may reduce the rates for femoral pseudoaneurysm, rates for AVF have not changed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Hemorrhagic complications of cardiovascular intervention are discussed elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/7-9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-diagnostic-cardiac-catheterization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of diagnostic cardiac catheterization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94697664\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AVFs may also result from penetrating injury to the lower extremity including stab wounds, gunshot and shotgun injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although there are no large epidemiologic studies on the prevalence of traumatic AVFs, the incidence may be rising due to the increasing number of firearm injuries over the last 30 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe extremity injury in the adult patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following any cardiovascular intervention, the puncture site should be carefully evaluated and a complete lower extremity vascular examination should assess for adequacy of the pulses; ideally, the pulses are compared with the pre-interventional vascular examination. Any findings suggestive of a vascular complication warrant further investigation.</p><p>Following combined artery and vein puncture, almost all AVFs are initially clinically silent. When symptoms occur, the time of onset ranges from two days to several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Symptoms suggestive of AVF include abnormal sensation (eg, vibration) in the groin, and fatigue, and new onset or worsened lower extremity ischemia.</p><p>The clinical diagnosis of AVF is made by palpation and auscultation of the affected vessel which may demonstrate a bruit, hematoma, or pulsatile mass. The patient may exhibit lower extremity edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Clinical conditions that are related to lower extremity AVF include deep venous thrombosis, symptoms of nerve compression and new onset or worsened varicose veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/2,10,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,22</a>]. The diagnosis of these conditions is discussed in separate topic reviews. </p><p>The most significant condition related to AVF is high-output heart failure, which has been estimated to occur after 0.01 to 0.02 percent of cardiac catheterizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The clinical diagnosis of high output heart failure is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of high-output heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94697943\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninvasive vascular laboratory examination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94697718\"><span class=\"h3\">Duplex ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duplex ultrasound is the current diagnostic test of choice for evaluating patients with suspected AVFs. On ultrasound, high frequency, low resistance flow is typical of AVFs with a mosaic color pattern on duplex. Often the specific artery and vein involved can be identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58366\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58366 \">image 1</a>). Duplex ultrasonography also provides a potential means of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H94697830\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound-guided compression'</a> below.)</p><p>Greater awareness of postcatheterization complications and the ease of diagnosis by duplex ultrasonography have reduced the incidence of symptomatic lower extremity AVFs. However, ultrasound scans are not routinely performed following instrumentation unless a large hematoma or bruit is present. For patients identified with an AVF, a follow-up ultrasound study is obtained after approximately a month to evaluate whether it has closed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94697951\"><span class=\"h3\">ABI and lower extremity physiologic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with known peripheral artery disease (PAD), or those with new onset symptoms of PAD, should be evaluated with physiologic vascular studies to evaluate the hemodynamic impact of the AVF on the distal lower extremity circulation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94699039\"><span class=\"h3\">Arteriography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not considered a first-line diagnostic modality, computed tomographic angiography is frequently performed in trauma patients and may demonstrate an AVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. On conventional arteriography, the AVF appears as a blush with rapid opacification of the adjacent deep vein. Arteriography may potentially lead to endovascular treatment in symptomatic patients. (See <a href=\"#H94697837\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular repair'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most small asymptomatic AVFs thrombose spontaneously and thus should be observed. Treatment is indicated for patients who develop symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/16,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22</a>]. Surgical repair is the standard approach, but ultrasound-guided compression (UGC) and percutaneous techniques are alternative treatments if anatomically feasible, especially for patients who may not tolerate any degree of bleeding, have a hostile groin due to excessive scar tissue, or who have a prohibitive risk for anesthesia.</p><p>In a study of 81 lower extremity AVFs, 57 patients who did not require immediate surgical repair were followed conservatively. Of these, 46 (81 percent) had spontaneous resolution of the AVF at a mean of 23 days. The remaining 11 required surgical closure at a mean of four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94697830\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound-guided compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound-guided compression (UGC) to effect closure of AVF refers to a technique in which an ultrasound probe is placed over the AVF to provide compression of sufficient force to abolish flow through the fistula without unduly reducing distal perfusion. The duration of compression is usually approximately 10 minutes. Ultrasound-guided compression can be attempted when the AVF is initially identified. In observational studies of UGC, up to one-third of patients with AV fistula may avoid the need for other forms of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/3,21,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21,24,25</a>]. However, the groin is often too tender to allow compression; if the procedure becomes painful, it should be abandoned. Failure of UGC is frequent and is because the fistula track is too short or the AV fistula is too large to be compressed effectively by the transducer. Chronic AVFs (&gt;2 to 3 weeks) rarely respond to compression. Ongoing anticoagulation also decreases success rates of UGC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1229237943\"><span class=\"h2\">Repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repair of AVF is indicated for patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical symptoms related to the AVF </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Steal syndrome causing claudication or distal limb ischemia </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant edema or venous insufficiency due to venous hypertension</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heart failure due to a high-flow fistula</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive enlargement under ultrasound surveillance </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large AVF following stab, gunshot or other projectile injury </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic AVFs that do not seal spontaneously </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1229237957\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery for AVF that is not associated with hematoma or pseudoaneurysm is relatively straightforward. The procedure can be performed under general or neuraxial anesthesia or peripheral nerve block depending upon patient and surgeon preference and underlying anesthetic risk. Just prior to the procedure, duplex ultrasound should be performed to confirm that the AVF is still patent and to mark its position on the skin.</p><p>In general, an incision is made overlying the site of the fistula as identified by duplex ultrasound or other imaging modality. It is important to note that the superficial veins of the skin and subcutaneous tissues are pressurized, and care must be taken to avoid uncontrolled transection. The superficial veins should be taken by two clamps, and carefully divided and ligated to minimize the potential for blood loss. The artery and vein proximal to the site are dissected free of the surrounding tissue and vascular control obtained with hemostatic loops. The artery is dissected from proximal to distal until the fistula is identified. The presence of localized inflammation usually identifies the site of the fistula. For acute AVFs, inflammation is typically minimal. During dissection of the fistula, care must be taken to avoid stripping the adventitia from the artery, which weakens the arterial wall and complicates the repair. Before the AVF is closed, the involved vein is under excess pressure and is easily damaged. </p><p>Once the arteriovenous connection is divided, direct pressure is usually all that is needed to control bleeding from the venous wall defect. The arterial wall defect can be controlled with pressure, or arterial hemostatic loops or clamps. Each defect is sutured closed with permanent suture; often only a single stitch in each is needed. Once the repair is complete, control on the artery is released and the pulse distal to the repair site evaluated with a Doppler. </p><p>Complications of surgical AVF repair include hemorrhage due to venous hypertension and groin infection. In some cases, the AVF may be difficult to identify [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/12,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,27</a>]. Under this circumstance, intraoperative duplex ultrasound may help identify the fistula and its origin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94697837\"><span class=\"h2\">Endovascular repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endovascular repair of AVF is an alternative treatment for those patients deemed too high risk for anesthesia, those with a hostile groin due to excessive scar tissue, or who may not tolerate the consequences of hemorrhage that may occur with surgical control of the AV fistula. Percutaneous interventions, including covered stent placement or embolization techniques, may be effective as an alternative to surgical repair. However, these interventions require arterial puncture, typically in the contralateral common femoral artery, which may also develop complications.</p><p>Covered stent implantation is an attractive treatment option for AVFs. The ability to use this technology depends upon the location of the fistula, the presence of underlying peripheral artery disease and the overall medical status of the patient.</p><p>The common femoral artery is a less suitable location for a stent due to the potential for stent deformation and fracture from hip flexion and rotation. Stent placement at this location may also preclude the use of the site for future femoral access. Iatrogenic AVF that originates from the proximal superficial femoral or deep femoral artery may be more amenable to percutaneous repair because these sites are less likely to be mechanically distorted; however, because the deep femoral vessels are smaller in caliber, it may be at risk for stent-graft thrombosis. Short covered superficial femoral artery stents placed appear to have adequate patency. </p><p>Reported patency rates for stent-graft repair of AVF range between 88 percent and 100 percent at follow-up (eight months to one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/24,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27-29</a>]. Although long-term follow-up is limited, percutaneous coil or N-butyl-cyanoacrylate embolization are alternative endovascular treatment approaches, provided the connecting channel of the AVF can be appropriately imaged and is of sufficient length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/24,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94697906\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis for AV fistula following repair is excellent. Physiologic derangements reverse immediately after the fistula is closed. In one report, for example, the mean cardiac output decreased from 12.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> to 5.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> after surgical repair of the AVFs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-arteriovenous-fistula-of-the-lower-extremity/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. For patients with underlying peripheral artery disease, the increase in arterial flow to the lower extremity following fistula repair can be expected to return the patient to baseline functional status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94697279\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are abnormal connections between the arterial and venous system.
