These diseases include chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and asthma. By virtue of common usage, however, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has come to refer specifically to chronic bronchitis and emphysema.</p><p>Primary therapy for COPD is directed at reducing airways resistance. To the extent that bronchial smooth muscle constriction and airway inflammation and mucous plugging contribute to airflow obstruction, bronchodilators (along with smoking cessation) can improve lung function. By comparison, there is currently no effective therapy for the irreversible airflow obstruction that results from airway obliteration, peribronchial and peribronchiolar fibrosis, and loss of elastic recoil.</p><p>Both anticholinergic (also known as muscarinic) agents and beta adrenergic agonists are effective in reversing the reversible part of airway obstruction. However, inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide is preferred over beta-2 agonists by many as the bronchodilator of choice in COPD for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Its minimal cardiac stimulatory effects compared to those of beta-agonists</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Its greater effectiveness than either beta-agonist or methylxanthine bronchodilators in most studies of patients with COPD</p><p/><p>As a manifestation of the importance of anticholinergic medications in the treatment of COPD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide was the only bronchodilator studied in the landmark Lung Health Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, combination therapy with both beta-agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators may be helpful in some patients.</p><p>It is important to recognize that regular long-term therapy with bronchodilators does not alter the natural history of COPD, as was clearly demonstrated by the outcome of the Lung Health Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since treatment does not alter the natural history of the disease, no treatment is needed in asymptomatic patients. In symptomatic patients, by comparison, relief of dyspnea and improvement in exercise tolerance and quality of life are the main achievable outcomes of therapy in COPD.</p><p>This topic will review the role of anticholinergic medications in the treatment of COPD, based upon our current understanding of the pharmacology of these medications and the pathophysiology of COPD. The management of acute exacerbations and the approach to the treatment of COPD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologically active anticholinergic alkaloids exist in the roots, seeds, and leaves of a variety of belladonna plants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most important of these naturally occurring alkaloids are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a>.</p><p>Atropa belladonna, the deadly nightshade, contains mainly the alkaloid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>. The same alkaloid is present in Datura stramonium, known as Jamestown or jimson weed, stinkweed, thorn-apple, and devil's apple. The alkaloid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> (hyoscine) is found chiefly in the shrub Hyoscyamus niger (henbane) and Scopolia carniolica.</p><p>The use of extracts from these plants for the relief of respiratory symptoms and bronchospasm originated thousands of years ago in India and was introduced into Western medicine by British colonists in the early 19th century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> was then isolated in a pure form by Mein in 1831. In 1867, Bezold and Bloebaum showed that atropine blocked the cardiac effects of vagal stimulation, and five years later Heidenhain found that it prevented salivary secretion produced by stimulation of the chorda tympani. In 1859, it was reported that a severe asthma attack was successfully treated by injecting atropine into the vagus nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Smoke from the leaves of these plants became the preparation of choice for relief of bronchospasm; inhalational and systemic preparations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> were soon available for the treatment of asthma. With the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> during the 20th century, the use of atropine and related substances for relief of bronchospasm declined. Anticholinergic therapy has again come to the forefront of bronchospastic therapy with the introduction of the synthetic quaternary derivatives of atropine, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium</a> bromide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parasympathetic nervous system plays a major role in regulating bronchomotor tone. The bulk of autonomic nerves in the human airways are branches of the vagus nerve, whose efferent preganglionic fibers enter the lung at the hilum and travel along the airways into the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A diverse set of stimuli can cause a reflex increase in parasympathetic activity that contributes to bronchoconstriction. Acetylcholine (ACh) is the endogenous neurotransmitter at cholinergic nerve endings, and its actions are mediated through nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. The figure outlines the role of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in cholinergic transmission in the airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58052\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58052 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nicotinic receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nicotinic receptors are located on ganglionic neurons and are activated by ACh released from preganglionic vagal fibers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58052\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58052 \">figure 1</a>). These receptors are stimulated by nicotinic agonists and inhibited by nicotinic antagonists like hexamethonium. They are not significantly affected by currently available anticholinergic medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscarinic receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscarinic receptors are found primarily on the autonomic effector cells that are innervated by postganglionic parasympathetic nerves. There are at least five subtypes of muscarinic receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. At least three of these are expressed in the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79055\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79055 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M1 receptors are present on peribronchial ganglion cells where the preganglionic nerves transmit signals to the postganglionic nerves</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M2 receptors are present on the postganglionic nerves</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M3 receptors are present on smooth muscle</p><p/><p>M1 and M3 receptors mediate the parasympathetic bronchoconstrictive effect of the vagus nerve. Vagal fibers synapse and activate nicotinic and M1 muscarinic receptors in parasympathetic ganglia present in the airway wall. Short postganglionic fibers release ACh, which acts on M3 muscarinic receptors in airway smooth muscle. The submucosal glands are also innervated by parasympathetic neurons and have predominantly M3 receptors.</p><p>The activation of M1 and M3 receptors by ACh and its analogs stimulates secretion by tracheobronchial glands and causes bronchoconstriction. On the other hand, activation of M2 receptors limits further production of ACh and protects against parasympathetic-mediated bronchoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Based upon this information, an ideal anticholinergic agent would inhibit only the M1 and M3 receptors and spare the M2 receptors.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> (the prototype of muscarinic receptor antagonists) prevents the effects of ACh by competitively blocking its binding to muscarinic receptors in the CNS, peripheral ganglia, and at neuroeffector sites on smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and secretory glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Atropine inhibits secretions of the nose, mouth, pharynx, and bronchi and thus causes dryness of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. This action is especially marked if secretion is excessive and is the basis for the use of atropine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> in preanesthetic medication. This depression of mucous secretion and the inhibition of mucociliary clearance, however, are undesirable side effects of atropine in patients with airway disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> is particularly effective against bronchoconstriction produced by parasympathomimetic drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>; it also partially antagonizes bronchoconstriction induced by histamine and bradykinin. In general, however, muscarinic receptor antagonists cause little blockade of the effects of ACh at nicotinic receptor sites. As a result, extremely high doses of atropine or related drugs are required to produce any degree of blockade of the predominantly nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TERTIARY VERSUS QUATERNARY AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quaternary ammonium drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a>) are synthetic derivatives of the naturally occurring tertiary ammonium compounds (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55857 \">figure 2</a>). Ipratropium bromide is derived by the introduction of an isopropyl group to the N atom of atropine. Other quaternary compounds include Oxitropium bromide (which is a derivative of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a> formed by the introduction of an ethyl group) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium</a> bromide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The structure of the quaternary ammonium compounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55857 \">figure 2</a>) renders them freely soluble in water but insoluble in lipids; it is therefore difficult for these compounds to cross biologic barriers that can be easily crossed by the tertiary ammonium compounds like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>. Most of the pharmacologic properties that distinguish quaternary ammonium compounds from atropine are due to this feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tertiary ammonium compounds are lipid-soluble, easily absorbed, and can cause significant side effects, including tachycardia, dry mouth, flushing of the skin, blurred vision, and mood changes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since compounds with a quaternary ammonium structure are poorly absorbed after oral administration, they cause fewer side effects</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quaternary compounds generally exhibit a greater degree of nicotinic blocking activity and consequently are likely to interfere with neuromuscular transmission in doses that more closely approximate those that cause muscarinic block.</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ipratropium</a> bromide is the most widely studied and used quaternary anticholinergic medication in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Ipratropium bromide produces effects similar to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> when each agent is administered parenterally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. These include bronchodilation, tachycardia, and inhibition of salivary secretion. Unlike atropine, however, ipratropium lacks appreciable effect on the central nervous system (CNS), is poorly absorbed from the lungs or the gastrointestinal tract, and does not inhibit mucociliary clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. The use of ipratropium in patients with COPD therefore avoids the increased accumulation of lower airway secretions and the antagonism of beta-adrenergic agonist-induced enhancement of mucociliary clearance that is encountered with atropine.</p><p>Even when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide is administered in amounts many times the recommended dosage, little or no change occurs in heart rate, blood pressure, bladder function, intraocular pressure, or pupillary diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This selectivity results from the very inefficient absorption of the drug from airway or gastrointestinal mucosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">IPRATROPIUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ipratropium</a> bromide (Atrovent) was first introduced to the United States in 1987 in a metered dose inhaler (MDI) form. In addition, a 0.02 percent solution for nebulized administration has also been introduced. Each puff of the MDI provides 18 mcg of ipratropium bromide, and each canister contains 200 inhalations.</p><p>The propellant in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> MDIs has traditionally been a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). Following adoption of the Montreal protocol (an international agreement to ban CFCs), ipratropium inhalers that contain hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) have become widely available. Prior to initial use of the HFA formulation, the inhaler should be actuated into the air twice; this step should be repeated if the inhaler is not used for more than three days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommended dose from the MDI is two puffs four times daily, but the medication is well tolerated when given in much higher doses (four to eight puffs four times a day). Although the dose of the nebulized solution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> can be as low as 50 to 125 mcg, the dose may need to be increased for the treatment of acute bronchospasm. Each 2.5 mL unit dose contains 500 mcg of ipratropium, which is the currently recommended dose to be given three to four times per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of bronchodilation produced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> is thought to reflect the level of parasympathetic tone. In normal individuals, the inhalation of ipratropium provides complete protection against bronchoconstriction from inhaled irritants like sulfur dioxide, ozone, nebulized citric acid, or cigarette smoke. However, patients with asthma <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atopy are more responsive to these irritants and are less well protected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ipratropium</a> also causes marked reduction in airway sensitivity to inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> and a modest reduction in airway sensitivity from challenge with histamine or bradykinin; however, it provides little protection against the bronchoconstriction induced by 5-HT or the leukotrienes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>].</p><p>Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide by MDI achieves its maximal effect in adults in a dose of 40 to 80 mcg, delivered by two to four actuations of the inhaler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], or 50 to 125 mcg delivered by nebulizer. Because penetration of inhaled particles into the airways is impaired when the airways are severely obstructed, higher doses may be needed for a maximal effect in patients with more severe airway disease. Higher doses may result in bronchodilation of greater duration than magnitude. Tachyphylaxis to ipratropium has not been demonstrated, and thus its efficacy is not blunted over years of regular use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ipratropium</a> has been shown to alleviate dyspnea, increase exercise tolerance, and improve gas exchange in patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ipratropium, however, does not have anti-inflammatory properties and does not alter the natural history of the disease in terms of lung function or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>].</p><p>The Lung Health Study prospectively evaluated the effect of smoking cessation with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> therapy on the decline of lung function in 5887 male and female smokers with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this landmark study, the anticholinergic bronchodilator ipratropium was chosen as the bronchodilator of choice because of its low frequency of side effects, relatively long duration of action, and demonstrated bronchodilator efficacy in patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/1,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,10</a>].

This relative improvement was maintained for the succeeding four years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56320 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The improvement in lung function appeared to reverse within a few weeks of stopping the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a>.</p><p/><p>As concluded by the study investigators, these results reflect the relatively short term, pharmacologically mediated change in lung function attributable to the bronchodilator. Since this effect is presumably available at any time during the course of disease, these results support the use of bronchodilators for symptomatic benefit, including relief of dyspnea and improvement in exercise tolerance. By comparison, no treatment is needed in asymptomatic patients, as therapy does not alter the natural history of the disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Ipratropium versus beta-agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> has been shown to be superior to the beta-adrenergic agonists in both short- and long-term studies. As an example, in a multicenter, randomized trial of 260 patients with COPD but no asthma or atopy, ipratropium was more potent at its peak effect and was longer acting than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metaproterenol-orciprenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metaproterenol</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73667\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73667 \">figure 4</a>). Similar findings were also reported for nebulized ipratropium bromide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, some studies have shown that ipratropium bromide produced significant bronchodilation in patients who did not respond to inhaled sympathomimetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ipratropium</a> therapy may also result in an improvement in the quality of life of patients with COPD. In a multicenter, randomized trial of 223 patients with COPD, the efficacy of nebulized ipratropium (500 mcg) was compared to nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> (2.5 mg) (each taken three times daily for up to 83 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-anticholinergic-therapy-in-copd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although clinical improvement was noted in both groups, the ipratropium bromide group had a greater symptomatic benefit and scored higher on quality of life questionnaires.</p><p>Although the side effects of inhaled beta-2 agonists are generally minor, they may produce troublesome tremor in the dosages required to produce bronchodilation in COPD.
