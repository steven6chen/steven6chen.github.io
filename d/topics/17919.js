Viruses are widely recognized as common triggers of early childhood wheezing both in children with recurrent wheezing with multiple triggers as well as those with episodic exacerbations whose predominant trigger of wheezing is viral infections. In fact, a viral cause was detected in 90 percent of wheezing illnesses in a birth cohort of children at increased risk of developing asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Early childhood wheezing encompasses many clinical phenotypes, and responses to treatment are variable. Instituting or escalating asthma therapies is effective in controlling viral-induced wheezing symptoms in some patients. However, the evidence for this approach is not definitive in controlled studies, particularly in patients with intermittent symptoms.</p><p>The optimal management for acute episodes of virus-induced wheezing in infants and preschool children has yet to be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Therapeutic trials in this young population are hampered by the inability to predict clinical phenotypes, such as children who will outgrow their symptoms, children who will later develop asthma, and children who have bronchiolitis, a condition for which glucocorticoids generally are not recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic reviews the treatment of young children with recurrent virus-induced wheezing, defined as a minimum of three to four wheezing exacerbations a year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Treatment of bronchiolitis in infants and virus-induced asthma exacerbations in children and adults are discussed separately. The mechanisms by which viral respiratory infections cause wheezing and asthma exacerbations and the influence of viral infection on both the development and perpetuation of asthma are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virus-induced-wheezing-and-asthma-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virus-induced wheezing and asthma: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPISODIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virus-induced wheezing is a heterogeneous disorder, and response to treatment may differ among individuals. Inhaled short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists are commonly used for symptomatic relief. Combination therapy with hypertonic saline (HS) and a bronchodilator is under investigation for treatment of acute symptoms. Inhaled and systemic glucocorticoids and leukotriene-receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have been studied for the treatment and prevention of acute episodes of virus-induced wheezing in young children who require additional therapy. Treatment of asthma, both for acute exacerbations and prevention of symptoms, is discussed in detail separately.

However, inhaled short-acting bronchodilators have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes, decrease the rate of hospital admission, or decrease the duration of hospitalization in children with bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, a systematic review and meta-analysis did not show benefit with the use of beta-agonists in children with acute cough or bronchitis, although the analysis was limited to two pediatric trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Similar limited findings have been reported for the treatment of bronchiolitis. Further study is needed before this treatment can be recommended for clinical use in children with recurrent wheeze. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention#H429407294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Nebulized hypertonic saline'</a>.)</p><p>The use of inhaled HS for the treatment of lower respiratory tract disease is based upon the hypothesis that viral infection, particularly with rhinovirus, leads to dehydration of the airway surface liquid and impaired mucus clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Several studies have reported decreased rates of hospital admission and decreased length of hospital stay in infants and children with acute bronchiolitis treated with inhaled HS, but other studies have not replicated these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. In addition, the studies with positive findings often excluded children with a history of prior wheezing, limiting the ability to draw conclusions about this therapy in children with recurrent wheezing episodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent inhaled glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of intermittent inhaled glucocorticoids on the prevention or attenuation of virus-induced wheezing in young children has been examined in several randomized trials and a systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/3,13-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13-21</a>]. These studies are difficult to compare because of differences in dose of inhaled glucocorticoid used, timing of when the medication is started in relation to the upper respiratory tract infection (URI), and primary outcome measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Overall these studies suggest that <strong>intermittent</strong> <strong>high</strong>-dose inhaled glucocorticoids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68517 \">table 2</a>), started at the onset of a URI and continued for up to 10 days, may decrease asthma-type symptoms and rescue oral glucocorticoid use in preschool children with viral-associated wheezing in children not on daily inhaled glucocorticoid therapy. This approach may be particularly effective in patients with asthma risk factors. However, there may be slight deficits in growth in some children, although the data are limited. It is unclear if intermittent high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids are effective if started after the onset of wheezing in the setting of a URI. <strong>Intermittent</strong> use of <strong>standard</strong> (low to medium) doses of inhaled glucocorticoids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68517 \">table 2</a>) does not appear to be effective in this population, particularly when started after the onset of lower respiratory tract symptoms. Standard daily doses of inhaled glucocorticoids are effective in preventing episodic virus-induced wheezing in young children, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Daily inhaled glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p>The following randomized trials of intermittent therapy are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate (750 mcg twice daily), administered as three inhalations of a 250 mcg Flovent HFA (hydrofluoroalkane) inhaler, was started at the onset of a URI and continued for up to 10 days in a trial of 129 children aged one to six years with recurrent virus-induced wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Treatment with high-dose fluticasone decreased the use of rescue oral glucocorticoids compared with placebo (8 versus 18 percent of URIs required such rescue treatment, respectively). However, smaller gains in height and weight were seen in the treatment group (-0.33 cm and -0.64 kg) compared with placebo over the 6- to 12-month study period. Further study is needed to investigate the long-term effects of this treatment. The only formulation available in the United States that delivers this exact dose is a dry-powder inhaler (DPI)<em>,</em> but a 250 mcg HFA inhaler is available in other countries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodic use of high-dose inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> (1 mg twice daily for seven days, started early in the course of a URI at the onset of a set of symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs individual to each child that typically preceded the onset of wheezing) was as effective as chronic daily budesonide (0.5 mg nightly) with respect to frequency of exacerbations requiring oral glucocorticoid therapy in a trial of 278 children aged 12 to 53 months with recurrent wheezing and a positive asthma predictive index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There were also no significant differences between the two groups in bronchodilator use, episode-free days, or severity of symptoms during respiratory tract illnesses. Furthermore, treatment with intermittent high-dose budesonide resulted in a lower cumulative exposure to budesonide as compared with daily budesonide therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An earlier systematic review identified three trials of preschool children with recurrent wheeze given episodic high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids for 5 to 10 days for exacerbations in the setting of viral illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/13-15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15,20</a>]. Two of these studies showed a reduced requirement for oral glucocorticoids (risk ratio [RR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.27-1.04), and all showed modest decreases in symptom scores.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, another trial using high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> (1 mg twice daily) at the start of a URI did not find any difference in rescue oral glucocorticoid use compared with intermittent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a> or placebo in 238 children one to six years of age with moderate to severe intermittent wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Formulations that can deliver this exact dose of budesonide are not available in the United States (budesonide is available as a DPI at 90 and 180 mcg doses and as respules for nebulization at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg doses).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The data are mixed regarding the use of oral glucocorticoids to treat virus-induced wheezing in preschoolers, in part due to the heterogeneity of studies and outcomes measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-28</a>]. Overall, this approach does not appear to be effective in most patients with preschool wheezing. However, there may be subgroups, such as those patients at high risk for developing asthma or with a history of severe recurrent wheezing, who may benefit.</p><p>A number of randomized trials have been conducted that vary in terms of clinical setting, dose of glucocorticoid administered, and patient population studied. Overall, oral glucocorticoids have not been shown to decrease the rate of hospital admissions or reduce symptom frequency or severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. However, one study that compared the length of hospital stay in wheezing children 24 to 72 months of age (mean age 41 months) who were started on a three-day course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> in the emergency department reported a decreased hospital stay in children requiring admission for greater than seven hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This is in contrast to a prior study in younger children (mean age 26 months) with fewer asthma risk factors that found no difference in duration of hospitalization in those treated with a five-day course of prednisolone compared with those who were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28</a>]. The mixed results in several large clinical trials may also be due in part to the heterogeneity of diseases leading to wheezing in preschool children.</p><p>The following studies are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter trial, 700 preschool children (10 to 60 months of age) with acute virus-induced wheezing were randomly assigned to five days of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thirty-eight percent of the study population had no previous episodes of wheezing, 34 percent had one to three episodes, and 28 percent had four or more. Treatment with prednisolone did not shorten hospital stay, reduce <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> use, or improve symptom scores (although the baseline assessment was performed after initial albuterol administration). A seven-day post-hospitalization symptom score and readmission rate for both treatment groups was also the same. The lack of benefit of prednisolone was also noted in a subgroup analysis of 124 children at high risk for atopic asthma (history of &ge;4 wheezing episodes and a parent with asthma or clinician-diagnosed eczema).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One open, unblinded study examined the effect of preventive intervention with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> for virus-induced wheezing episodes of asthma in preschool children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In this study, 32 children were identified early in life for wheezing with viral respiratory infections. There were two observation periods. During the first period, conventional therapy was given and the characteristics of the patient's response to a viral infection defined. During the second year, one group of patients received conventional therapy for wheezing episodes associated with a respiratory infection and one received prednisone (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) at the first sign of a URI, prior to any signs of wheezing, in addition to conventional therapy. The prednisone-treated children had significantly fewer days with wheezing, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. These observations suggest that early intervention with systemic glucocorticoids can reduce the symptoms of virus-induced exacerbations, although confirmation of these findings in randomized trials is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dosing regimens for systemic glucocorticoids in trials have varied. Recommendations for the acute treatment for asthma exacerbations continue to support <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> dosing at 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> or an equivalent dose of an alternative oral or intramuscular glucocorticoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>].</p><p/><p>The question of whether glucocorticoids are beneficial in subgroups of patients (eg, those with recurrent episodes of virus-induced wheezing, atopic features, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family history of asthma) remains unanswered. Results from one subgroup analysis suggest that the response to systemic glucocorticoids during wheezing episodes requiring hospitalization may differ based upon the type of virus detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-recurrent-virus-induced-wheezing-in-young-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Additional studies are necessary to better define the characteristics of children who wheeze severely but intermittently and do or do not respond to oral glucocorticoid therapy. How glucocorticoid responsiveness relates to preschool children who will outgrow their asthma-like symptoms and those who will have asthma diagnosed later also needs to be studied.
