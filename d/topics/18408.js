Since then, it has become clear that the CR monitor is not an effective tool to prevent SIDS.</p><p>Nonetheless, there is some justification for the use of CR monitors in selected infants with other underlying disorders. Selection of infants for monitoring depends upon the infant's underlying problem and the capabilities of the monitor. In many cases, the primary utility of the monitor is diagnostic (ie, to distinguish genuine from false CR events and document the nature and frequency of CR events) rather than therapeutic (ie, to provide an alarm that allows intervention to terminate events).</p><p>The appropriate use of CR monitors for specific disorders, the capabilities and limitations of the devices, and the management of infants with CR monitors will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, evaluation, and other approaches to managing the disorders for which CR monitoring is sometimes considered are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden infant death syndrome: Risk factors and risk reduction strategies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute events in infancy including brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-apnea-of-prematurity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of apnea of prematurity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTROVERSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of home cardiorespiratory (CR) monitors has become increasingly controversial. In a 1987 NIH Consensus Statement on Infantile Apnea and Home Monitoring, home CR monitoring was recommended for infants thought to be at-risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). At that time, at-risk infants were thought to include premature infants with episodic apnea or bradycardia, infants who had experienced one or more severe apparent life threatening events (ALTE), and siblings of two or more SIDS victims. However, the authors of the statement were also careful to point out that &quot;the effectiveness of home monitoring in reducing infant mortality and morbidity is not yet established.&quot;</p><p>Since the publication of this document, advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders, outcomes of clinical trials, and clinical experience have substantially narrowed the indications for CR monitor use. One must also consider the high costs of continuous monitoring, which include the device, training and respite of caretakers, and analysis of recorded events. In addition, concerns have been raised that the use of CR monitors might distract from other established preventive measures (eg, safe sleeping environment for prevention of SIDS), have adverse effects on the parents' quality of life, and present difficulties in determining an end point for monitoring.</p><p>A major problem in assessing the role of CR monitors to prevent infant death is that clinical efficacy cannot be established. Randomized controlled trials are impractical because death is a rare event in these infants, and because families are unlikely to consent to randomization.</p><p>The rationale for or against the use of CR monitoring for specific disorders is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring decisions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVICES AND CAPABILITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard home cardiorespiratory (CR) devices detect when the heart rate falls below or above a preset range or when there is no chest wall movement for a preset length of time. Most currently used monitors also record waveforms during events (documented monitoring), which can facilitate diagnosis and decisions about when to stop monitoring. Oxygen saturation measurements can be included on some monitors if specifically requested.</p><p>These devices directly measure central apnea by the lack of respiratory effort. They do NOT detect obstructive apnea in the absence of bradycardia.</p><p>Thus, the clinical utility of the monitor depends upon the pathophysiology of the underlying disorder. It will be more useful for infants at risk for central apnea or bradycardia (eg, apnea of prematurity) than for disorders in which apnea or bradycardia are late consequences of hypoxemia. If oxygen saturation measurements are included, the device may provide somewhat earlier recognition of events in infants with primary respiratory disease (eg, those with a tracheostomy or neuromuscular disease) provided that caretakers can respond in time to reverse the problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING DECISIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision as to whether or not cardiorespiratory (CR) monitoring should be considered in an individual infant varies with the underlying disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic infants with risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant younger than one year of age that remains unexplained despite a thorough case investigation, including autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although prematurity is one of several risk factors for SIDS, the mechanism and timing of SIDS are distinct from those of apnea of prematurity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden infant death syndrome: Risk factors and risk reduction strategies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the 1970s, it was proposed that prolonged central apnea was an early and, perhaps, primary event in the pathogenesis of SIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This &quot;apnea hypothesis&quot; was based on observations of recurrent brief apneic episodes during sleep in several infants, which resolved as the infants matured. Infants with these features were thought to be at risk for SIDS, and CR monitoring was proposed in an effort to prevent death.</p><p>Since then, several important advances have indicated that apnea is not an initial event in the pathogenesis of SIDS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several infants have died with home CR monitoring devices in place, and a body of literature has emerged presenting the data from so-called &quot;death tracings&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The data obtained from death tracings suggests that bradycardia occurs first and is followed by terminal apnea. It is hypothesized that hypoxia precedes the recorded bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Academy of Pediatrics launched the &quot;Back to Sleep&quot; campaign advocating supine sleeping in 1992 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Since that time, the SIDS rates in the United States have decreased by over 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing attention has been focused on the issue of child abuse and infanticide masquerading as recurrent apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) or SIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. A widely publicized case of five successive deaths in a family in New York resulted in greater recognition of this entity, especially in families with more than one occurrence among siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic studies and two decades of clinical experience have failed to show an effect of CR monitors in reducing the incidence of SIDS in infants presumed to be at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies using plethysmographic monitors capable of detecting both central and obstructive apnea in infants presumed at risk for SIDS displayed a high frequency of obstructed breathing, which would not be detected by conventional monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, there are currently no data to support the therapeutic use of cardiorespiratory monitoring as a means of reducing the risk for SIDS in asymptomatic infants, regardless of SIDS risk factors that may be present (e.g. prior sibling SIDS death, or prematurity). However, the physiologic parameters recorded by current monitors may have some diagnostic value, by defining the types of physiologic abnormalities occurring in some subgroups of infants, including symptomatic preterm infants, infants with apparent life threatening events, and infants with other underlying disorders, as discussed below.</p><p>Counseling parents of asymptomatic infants with risk factors for SIDS who request a home monitor may be challenging.&nbsp;We suggest that the clinician engage parents in a focused conversation that describes the potential negative consequences of using a home monitor and makes it clear that they should not consider a monitor to be a SIDS prevention strategy.&nbsp;However, we also suggest acknowledging that parents appropriately feel the need to watch their baby closely and that all parents have to decide how best to watch and check on their baby. In rare cases, where it is believed that the parents cannot cope using conventional strategies to watch their baby (ie, having the baby sleep in the parents' room, periodic entering the sleep room, or use of standard baby room listening devices), it may be reasonable to support the parents' desire to watch their baby with a home cardiorespiratory monitor.&nbsp;However, in such cases, it is critical to ensure that the parents have a clear understanding of the reason for using the monitor and the plan for when it should be discontinued (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Counseling of parents'</a> below). Finally, it is important to emphasize the need for the parents to follow recommended infant care practices related to reducing SIDS risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden infant death syndrome: Risk factors and risk reduction strategies&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Preterm infants with persistent symptoms related to apnea of prematurity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apnea of prematurity is defined as the sudden cessation of breathing that lasts for at least 20 seconds or is accompanied by bradycardia or a drop in oxygen saturation in an infant younger than 37 weeks postmenstrual age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-apnea-of-prematurity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of apnea of prematurity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most apneic events are central (ie, cessation of respiratory effort), and the disorder is thought to be caused by immaturity of respiratory control mechanisms. The breathing pattern matures with increasing postmenstrual age. Nonetheless, preterm infants continue to have more episodes of prolonged apnea than infants born at term until about 43 weeks postmenstrual age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Premature infants with persistent apnea of prematurity but who are otherwise ready for hospital discharge are candidates for home cardiorespiratory monitoring. Implementation of monitoring requires counseling and training of the caretakers, follow-up and review of events by a professional, and determination of an end point for monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Implementation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants with apparent life-threatening events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) is an acute, unexpected change in an infant's breathing behavior that was frightening to the caretaker, and is characterized by some combination of apnea, color change, change in muscle tone, choking, or gagging. Infants experiencing ALTEs represent a heterogeneous group of patients of varying ages with diverse pathophysiology. Although a relationship between ALTEs and SIDS was initially suggested, studies during the past two decades have failed to confirm a causal relationship. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute events in infancy including brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>A specific cause for the ALTE can be identified in over one-half of patients after a careful history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory evaluation. In most of these cases, the cause will be identified during the hospital evaluation, and home CR monitoring does not have additional diagnostic value. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute events in infancy including brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The decision for home monitor observation should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the presumed cause of the ALTE after a careful investigation, the estimated risk of recurrence, and after considering with the family the potential benefits, uncertainties, and stresses involved. In general, CR monitors would be less helpful for infants with presumed obstructive pathophysiology than for those with central apnea. In some cases, the potential value of the monitor lies in its ability to record physiologic data that may provide reassurance that clinically important events are not occurring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants with underlying diseases predisposing to respiratory failure, home CR monitoring may facilitate rapid recognition of central apnea, airway obstruction, respiratory failure, interruption of supplemental oxygen supply, or failure of mechanical respiratory support. Thus, infants with the following conditions are candidates for monitoring:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheostomy or airway abnormalities (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-intrathoracic-airways-and-tracheoesophageal-fistula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the intrathoracic airways and tracheoesophageal fistula&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic or metabolic disorders affecting respiratory control</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic lung disease (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia), especially those requiring supplemental oxygen, positive airway pressure, or mechanical ventilatory support (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>In some infants, oxygen saturation monitoring alone, or in conjunction with a CR device may provide more useful diagnostic information than a CR monitor alone. None of the currently available home CR monitors reliably detect obstructive apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLEMENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling of parents</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Families must be informed of the purpose of the monitor and what it can and cannot do. It is a tool to alert them to check the baby when an alarm is triggered either by the baby's heart rate falling below a preset limit or by the monitor's not detecting chest wall movement for a preset number of seconds.
