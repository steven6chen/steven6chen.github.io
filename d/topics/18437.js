Most data on the disparities by race and ethnicity are from the United States, but a South African study indicated similar differences in fibroid prevalence between black and nonblack women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The etiology of the increased incidence of leiomyomas in black women is unknown.

Differences in genetic factors, diet, lifestyle, psychosocial stress, and environmental exposures between black and white women are thought to contribute this disparity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

Most white women with symptomatic fibroids are in their 30s or 40s; however, black women develop symptoms on average four to six years younger and may even present with disease in their 20s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

The interplay of race, geographic residence, and access to health care makes it difficult to infer patient choices for fibroid therapy. The Southern United States, which also has the highest racial diversity, also has a higher prevalence of hysterectomy than the Northeast, but it is unknown if this is due to patient or provider choice or familiarity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

On bimanual pelvic examination, the size, contour, and mobility should be noted. An enlarged, mobile uterus with an irregular contour is consistent with a leiomyomatous uterus.

Magnetic resonance imaging may be used if ultrasound findings are not sufficient for surgical planning or if the diagnosis is uncertain, that is, if there is a suspicion of uterine sarcoma or adenomyosis.

Precise localization of fibroids is limited in larger uteri or when there are many tumors. Fibroids are seen on ultrasound usually as hypoechoic, well-circumscribed round masses, frequently with shadowing; cellular fibroids may appear to be more isoechoic, making differentiation from the normal myometrium difficult, or hyperechoic. Adenomyomas can mimic the appearance of cellular fibroids or multiple small fibroids. Sarcoma is also difficult to differentiate on imaging.</p><p>On imaging, calcification in a fibroid generally implies that it has degenerated. These calcifications can be seen on plain film as &quot;popcorn&quot; calcifications in the pelvis.&nbsp;On ultrasound, the calcifications may appear as clumps or rim-like calcifications within a mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96899\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef96899 \">image 3</a>).&nbsp;At times, only the calcification is seen and not the soft tissue component.&nbsp;In general, if compared with a sonogram pre-necrosis, the fibroid size will be smaller once it calcifies.</p><p>If fibroids are thought to be causing urinary tract obstruction, then a renal ultrasound can be obtained to assess for hydronephrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4291908966\"><span class=\"h3\">Step two: Evaluate the uterine cavity</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1086348094\"><span class=\"h4\">Saline infusion sonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Saline infusion sonography (sonohysterography) is an imaging study in which pelvic ultrasound is performed while saline is infused into the uterine cavity.

Women with adenomyosis more often present with a diffusely enlarged uterus, painful menses, and AUB. On examination in a woman with adenomyosis, the uterus is typically smooth, globular, and boggy. The two conditions are usually differentiated by imaging since each has a characteristic appearance on ultrasound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-adenomyosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine adenomyosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women may develop adenomyomas, which are benign glandular tumors within the myometrium. These can closely resemble leiomyomas on imaging. Adenomyosis and fibroids often occur in the same woman, making differentiation more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106</a>]. Intraoperatively, adenomyomas are generally more difficult to excise than leiomyomas. Leiomyomas are typically separated from the adjacent myometrium by a pseudocapsule. With adenomyomas, there is typically no tissue plane between the adenomyoma and the myometrium.</p><p>Benign or malignant uterine neoplasms must be differentiated from leiomyomas. The most common neoplastic condition that is part of the differential diagnosis is endometrial carcinoma. This is the most common site of gynecologic cancer in developed countries. Women present with uterine bleeding and may have a uterine mass. However, the ultrasound findings in endometrial carcinoma are likely to be a thickened endometrium or, in the case of more advanced disease, a lesion invading from the endometrium to the myometrium. This is a distinctly different appearance than a fibroid, which may be seen to distort the endometrial cavity, but not actually invade from the endometrium to the myometrium. Endometrial sampling is the best method of diagnosis for endometrial carcinoma and should be performed if this is a potential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58600 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Leiomyomas are a common condition, and thus, it may be presumed that a patient has myomas rather than a rare smooth muscle neoplasm. This includes leiomyoma variants that manifest some facets of malignancy yet lack others. For example, they may metastasize but not be locally invasive and be histologically benign. Some of these variants show no facets of malignancy. These lesions appear to be exceedingly rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=variants-of-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should also consider the possibility of a uterine sarcoma. Uterine sarcoma is rare (3 to 7 per 100,000 in the United States population) and has a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Both leiomyomas and uterine sarcoma present as focal masses in the uterine myometrium. There are several histologic types of uterine sarcoma. The main type of sarcoma that may resemble a leiomyoma is leiomyosarcoma, which presents as a myometrial mass, often with AUB. In contrast, endometrial stromal sarcoma presents as an endometrial mass. However, this could potentially have a similar appearance to a submucosal leiomyoma. Differentiating benign leiomyomas from uterine sarcomas is a clinical challenge and most sarcomas are not detected preoperatively. If there is a suspicion of a uterine sarcoma, operative techniques that disrupt the specimen (eg, myomectomy, morcellation) should be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-from-uterine-sarcomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adenomatoid tumors are an uncommon type of mass of the female reproductive tract that can be seen in the myometrium or in the adnexa (the most common place is actually next to the fallopian tube) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. They are mesothelial proliferations and are not histologically related to adenomyosis. They may grossly mimic leiomyomas.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of AUB is aided by pelvic imaging and a clinical description of the bleeding. Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding are typically the AUB patterns that are associated with leiomyomas, although these symptoms are also consistent with many other etiologies. Other AUB patterns, such as intermenstrual bleeding, irregular bleeding, or postmenopausal bleeding, are likely due to other causes. In the absence of a mass on pelvic ultrasound, leiomyomas can be excluded and other etiologies should be investigated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90595\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90595 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F90483\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90483 \">figure 4</a>).

Gastrointestinal, urinary tract, or other sources of pelvic pain should also be considered. In general, pain is not a major symptom in women with fibroids.

In a survey study, 20 to 40 percent of women with symptomatic fibroids reported feeling worn out and sad or discouraged; 21 percent also reported that fibroids made them feel not in control of their life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Twenty to 30 percent reported interference with physical and social activities, and 24 percent reported that fibroids prevented them from reaching full employment potential. </p><p>Compared with white women, black women experience more severe disease based on their symptoms and have more extensive disease at the time of hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. There is growing evidence of increases in symptomatology for black women with fibroids apart from those seeking surgical therapy, increased impairment of quality of life, different concerns regarding fibroids and the consequences of fibroid therapies, and less satisfaction with the information they receive about fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Importantly, black women were almost three times as likely to be concerned about fertility and healthy pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3264483890\"><span class=\"h2\">Economic impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine fibroids are costly to the health care system and the individual patient. Because they are the cause of 40 percent of hysterectomies, surgical costs and missed work days during recovery can add great expense to the treatment. Fibroids account for approximately $9.4 billion United States health care dollars annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Annual excess cost per woman with fibroids was estimated at more than $4600, which included $771 in missed work days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The incidence of leiomyomas parallels the life cycle changes of the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30312569\" class=\"local\">'Race'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leiomyomas are benign monoclonal tumors arising from the smooth muscle cells of the myometrium. Fibroids are typically described according to their location in the uterus (submucosal, intramural, subserosal, cervical). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms attributable to uterine myomas can generally be classified into three distinct categories: abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), pelvic pressure and pain, and reproductive dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine leiomyomas are a clinical diagnosis based upon pelvic imaging. The diagnosis is typically made based upon a pelvic ultrasound finding of leiomyomas, although other imaging modalities may be used. The indication for pelvic imaging typically includes symptoms of AUB, pelvic pain or pressure, or infertility; some women have an enlarged uterus on pelvic examination. In general, pathology confirmation is not required to proceed with management, except in cases in which another lesion is suspected, such as a uterine sarcoma or leiomyoma variant. Unfortunately, it is difficult to differentiate benign leiomyomas from these conditions, and thus, some cases will be wrongly diagnosed as leiomyomas. (See <a href=\"#H1736900957\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transvaginal ultrasound is the most widely used imaging modality for evaluating fibroids due to its availability and cost-effectiveness. Saline infusion sonography (sonohysterography) improves characterization of the extent of protrusion into the endometrial cavity by submucous myomas and allows identification of some intracavitary lesions not seen on routine ultrasonography. (See <a href=\"#H5287506\" class=\"local\">'Imaging and endoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relief of symptoms related to fibroids usually occurs at the time of menopause, when menstrual cyclicity stops and steroid hormone levels wane. Most, but not all, women have shrinkage of leiomyomas at menopause. Use of postmenopausal hormone therapy may cause some women with leiomyomas to continue to have symptoms after menopause. Hormone therapy may be associated with an increase in size of existing myomas but not with the development of new myomas. (See <a href=\"#H5291329\" class=\"local\">'Postmenopausal women'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Women on hormone therapy'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Baird DD, Dunson DB, Hill MC, et al.
