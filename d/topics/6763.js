The majority of foreign body ingestions occur in children between the ages of six months and three years. Most children with esophageal foreign bodies are brought to medical attention by their parents because the ingestion was witnessed or reported to them.</p><p>When symptoms do occur, they are often related to the location of the foreign body. Older children may localize the sensation of something &quot;stuck&quot; in the neck or lower chest, suggesting irritation in the upper or lower esophagus, respectively. Foreign bodies lodged in the esophagus at the cricoid cartilage or the tracheal bifurcation can compress the airway causing partial airway obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76887\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76887 \">image 1</a>). It is also possible that an esophageal foreign body will become dislodged into the upper airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-acute-upper-airway-obstruction-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Esophageal perforation from ingested sharp objects or erosion from retained smooth foreign bodies, particularly &quot;button&quot; batteries, may cause serious sequelae, including death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74761 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54791\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54791 \">picture 2</a>). Children with suspected foreign body or &ldquo;button&rdquo; battery ingestion should have prompt anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs performed to identify possible esophageal or gastrointestinal retention, since batteries in particular can cause severe esophageal injury within two hours of ingestion. Evidence of a double-ring or halo on the AP view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62847\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62847 \">image 2</a>), or step-off of the foreign body on the lateral view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77690\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77690 \">image 3</a>), indicates presence of a battery rather than a coin, and requires immediate removal.

It usually presents as dysphagia beginning acutely while eating. In children presenting with a food impaction, there is a higher incidence of underlying esophageal pathology (strictures, achalasia, eosinophilic esophagitis, or esophageal motility disorders) as compared to children with other esophageal foreign bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Children who are in acute distress or unable to swallow oral secretions following food impaction require immediate attention and removal of the impaction. If the patient is comfortable and able to handle oral secretions, endoscopic intervention can be delayed, as many food impactions will pass spontaneously.

Drooling and dysphagia commonly accompany severe oropharyngeal mucosal sloughing. Cases with less than 10 percent epidermal involvement are classified as SJS; those with 30 percent or more involvement are classified as TEN; cases with between 10 and 30 percent involvement are considered overlap <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span>.</p><p>TEN is almost invariably drug-induced, while SJS is associated with infections, as well as drug administration. SJS and TEN begin with a prodrome of fever and influenza-like symptoms one to three days before the development of mucocutaneous and skin lesions. Characteristic vesicular and bullous skin lesions then appear and progress over several days, followed by sloughing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82150\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82150 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68458\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68458 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59418\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59418 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73805\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73805 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76141\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76141 \">picture 5</a>).

Patients may also present with drooling, oral burns, retrosternal or abdominal pain, hematemesis, and features suggesting upper airway injury, such as stridor, hoarseness, nasal flaring, and retractions. Caustic ingestion may also cause a chemical epiglottitis or an esophageal perforation with mediastinitis.

Retropharyngeal abscess often is a polymicrobial infection. The predominant bacterial species are Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus), <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>), and respiratory anaerobes (including <em>Fusobacteria</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, and <em>Veillonella</em> species).</p><p>Early in the disease process, the findings may be indistinguishable from those of uncomplicated pharyngitis. With disease progression, symptoms related to inflammation and obstruction of the upper aerodigestive tract develop. Children with retropharyngeal abscess eventually appear ill with moderate fever. Symptoms may include dysphagia, odynophagia, drooling, pain on neck extension, torticollis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> muffled or &quot;hot potato&quot; voice. In addition, respiratory distress, stridor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neck swelling, mass, or lymphadenopathy may be present.

Sudden onset of high fever (between 38.8 and 40.0&ordm;C), odynophagia, and severe sore throat are also characteristic of infectious epiglottitis. Non-infectious epiglottitis may also occur in children who ingest caustic substances or hot liquids.</p><p>Children with epiglottitis usually appear &quot;toxic&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76538\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76538 \">picture 11</a>) and may assume a sitting position with the trunk leaning forward, neck hyperextended, and chin thrust forward in an effort to maximize the diameter of the obstructed airway (the &quot;tripod&quot; posture) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79826\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79826 \">picture 12</a>). They may be reluctant to lie down. Although many patients have minor antecedent upper respiratory tract symptoms, the usual duration of notable illness before hospitalization is &lt;24 hours and frequently &lt;12 hours.

They may also rarely exhibit bulbar signs with difficulty swallowing due to infection of the components of the swallowing pathway (eg, cortical motor stripe, vagus nerve nucleus). Fever is usually present and may be of variable elevation.</p><p>Most patients with bacterial meningitis also present with fever and with clinical findings of meningeal inflammation (nausea, vomiting, irritability, anorexia, headache, confusion, back pain, and nuchal rigidity). However, the clinical manifestations of bacterial meningitis are variable and nonspecific; no single sign is pathognomonic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Children with encephalitis often have fever, altered mental status, seizures, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> focal neurologic signs.

While tetanus is now rare in the developed world, the disease remains a threat in developing countries. Dysphagia and trismus are common presenting symptoms in patients with generalized tetanus. Other clinical findings may include stiff neck, opisthotonos, and risus sardonicus (sardonic smile). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with generalized tetanus characteristically have tonic contraction of their skeletal muscles and intermittent intense muscular spasms. Since patients with tetanus have no impairment of consciousness or awareness, both the tonic contractions and spasms are intensely painful. Tetanic spasms may be triggered by loud noises or other sensory stimuli, such as physical contact or light.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Diphtheria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diphtheria occurs rarely in developed countries but remains a serious disease throughout much of the world. It is an acute, communicable disease caused by the Gram-positive bacillus, <em>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</em>. Respiratory diphtheria has a gradual onset of symptoms with sore throat, odynophagia, malaise, and low grade fever being the most common. In a significant percentage of patients, toxin elaborated locally induces the formation of a coalescing pseudomembrane which can extend to any portion of the respiratory tract from the nasal passages to the tracheobronchial tree and cause odynophagia. </p><p>Neurologic toxicity with uncoordinated swallowing, dysphagia, upper airway obstruction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary aspiration is unusual in mild disease but develops in up to three-fourths of patients with severe diphtheria. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Poliomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although polio no longer poses the public health threat in the United States that it once did, areas of endemic wild-type poliovirus still exist in other areas of the world. Up to one-third of patients may develop bulbar involvement with dysphagia, dysarthria, and difficulty handling secretions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polio and infectious diseases of the anterior horn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Central nervous system tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cranial neuropathies with drooling, dysphagia, diplopia, impairment of ocular movements, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> facial palsy, suggest underlying brainstem pathology. These findings represent common localizing signs of central nervous system tumors.

Caustic ingestions, erosive esophageal foreign bodies (ie, button batteries), and esophageal procedures (eg, endoscopy, dilation of esophageal strictures) are the most frequent causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Clinical findings of esophageal perforation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck pain (cervical esophageal perforation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain (thoracic esophageal perforation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea</p><p/><p>In addition, hematemesis may occur if the foreign body erodes into adjacent vascular structures.

Mediastinitis typically presents with fever and subcutaneous emphysema and rapidly progresses to septic shock within hours if not rapidly detected and treated. This infection is usually polymicrobial and is caused by mouth flora, including Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, anaerobic bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Laboratory evaluation of these patients should include a complete blood count, blood culture, electrolytes, and type and screen.</p><p>Plain radiographs of the chest (AP and lateral) and neck (soft tissue lateral and AP) will detect esophageal perforation in 90 to 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Findings depend on the location of the perforation. Neck films demonstrate air in the prevertebral fascial planes of the retropharynx and subcutaneous emphysema in patients with cervical esophageal perforations. Findings associated with more distal esophageal perforations on chest radiograph include pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pleural effusion, hydrothorax, hydropneumothorax, and subdiaphragmatic air (upright film).</p><p>When suspected, esophageal perforation warrants emergent consultation with a surgeon with pediatric thoracic surgery expertise.</p><p>Contrast esophagography or computed tomography may identify the specific site of esophageal perforation and are confirmatory studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
