PTSD is seen in some children (and not others) after exposure to traumatic experiences involving actual or threatened injury to themselves or others. Traumatic experiences leading to PTSD can include interpersonal violence, accidents, natural disasters, and injuries. </p><p>PTSD is characterized by intrusive thoughts and reminders of the traumatic experience(s), avoidance of trauma reminders, negative mood and cognitions related to the traumatic experience(s), and physiological hyperarousal that lead to significant social, school, and interpersonal problems. PTSD can occur even in toddlers (one to two years old) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The consequences of PTSD include elevated risk for other mental disorders and suicide, substantial impairment in role functioning, reduced social and economic opportunity, and earlier onset of chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular disease. </p><p>This topic and an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F114818\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114818 \">algorithm 1</a>) describe our approach to selecting treatment, including psychosocial interventions and pharmacotherapy, for PTSD in children and adolescents. Psychosocial interventions for PTSD in children and pharmacotherapy for PTSD in children are reviewed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of PTSD in children are also reviewed separately. PTSD in adults is also reviewed separately.

No medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PTSD in children. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), which are an efficacious, first-line pharmacologic treatment for adults with PTSD, have not been found to be efficacious in multiple small randomized trials in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents#H407869\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Trauma-focused psychotherapies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Varied trauma-focused psychotherapy models emphasize different components <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have been customized to treat patients with specific characteristics, clinical presentations, or in certain settings. There is limited evidence available to inform selection among these therapies. </p><p>Few clinical trials have directly compared the psychotherapies, and these comparisons did not show differences in PTSD outcomes. As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 48 children with PTSD symptoms to receive eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) or trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Eight sessions of each intervention resulted in large effect sizes for PTSD improvement; no difference in reduction in PTSD symptoms was seen. Parents of children treated with TF-CBT, but not those treated with EMDR, reported improvement in child depressive and hyperactivity symptoms. </p><p>Our preferences regarding trauma focused psychotherapies vary by age group and stem largely from clinical trials comparing individual therapies with inactive controls, secondary data analyses, and our clinical experience. Multiple therapies have been shown to be efficacious for youth with PTSD compared with an inactive control. The intervention should be provided by a therapist who has received appropriate training in the model used. A full course of therapy should be completed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents#H407869\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Trauma-focused psychotherapies'</a>.)</p><p>Trauma-focused psychotherapy can be provided to individual patients or to groups. Group models are useful where there are resource constraints, an absence of trained therapists, or other barriers to access that preclude individual therapy, eg, Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. The choice between individual and group modalities may also be influenced by family preference, by specific population needs (eg, trauma and grief component therapy for teens with both PTSD and maladaptive grief symptoms), or by clinical presentation. We favor individual rather than group therapy for children with severe PTSD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] Specific therapies are suggested for population subgroups, including:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1527913203\"><span class=\"h2\">Children seven years and older</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most children seven years and over with PTSD or PTSD symptoms, TF-CBT is the intervention most strongly supported by evidence from clinical trials. These findings have been replicated in diverse populations of children with diverse types of trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

The trial randomly assigned 118 schoolchildren with PTSD symptoms identified by screening to receive CBITS at their schools or TF-CBT at community clinics. Students assigned to the school-based intervention were more likely to access treatment than students assigned to the clinic-based intervention (98 versus 37 percent). Both groups experienced reductions in PTSD symptoms, but no differences were seen between groups.

If core treatment components are provided incorrectly or not at all, the treatment will likely be ineffective. In such cases, improved fidelity and outcomes can often be attained by ensuring that therapists receive appropriate training and consultation in the selected model, receive ongoing, model-specific supervision, and monitor their treatment fidelity over time. Certification or other documentation (when available) that therapists have completed all recommended training requirements for the chosen model can enhance the likelihood of children receiving treatment with high fidelity. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2800938949\"><span class=\"h4\">Trauma reminders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lack of response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in children with PTSD should prompt more careful exploration of potential trauma reminders or triggers, further development of different coping strategies for these triggers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> helping the child to master the coping strategies identified (eg, during in-session practice).
