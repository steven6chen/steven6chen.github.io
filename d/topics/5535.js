Each half of the protein consists of three polypeptide chains (ie, A-alpha [A&alpha;], B-beta [B&beta;], and gamma [&gamma;]) encoded by three different genes on chromosome 4 (<em>FGA</em>, <em>FGB</em>, and <em>FGG</em>). The trinodular structure of fibrinogen can be described as a central E region (containing the amino-terminal [N-terminal] portions of the three polypeptide chains) and two D regions (C-terminal portions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The fully assembled hexamer can be designated (A&alpha;B&beta;&gamma;)<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Fibrinogen circulates in the plasma at a concentration of approximately 200 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> by far the highest concentration of any plasma coagulation factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This is because fibrinogen contributes a major structural component of the clot rather than an enzymatic function. The half-life of circulating fibrinogen is approximately three to four days, with a catabolic rate of approximately 25 percent per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As with all clotting factors, fibrinogen is present in plasma but not serum.</p><p>A small pool of fibrinogen is taken up by platelets in a process mediated by platelet <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> and stored in platelet alpha-granules; this fibrinogen can support platelet aggregation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Megakaryocyte biology and the production of platelets&quot;, section on 'Specific platelet granules'</a>.)</p><p>Fibrinogen synthesis is controlled at the level of transcription. Circulating plasma fibrinogen levels increase with age, obesity, smoking, and inflammatory states; levels decrease with alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The inducible component is mainly influenced by the acute phase response. As an acute phase reactant, fibrinogen biosynthesis is increased by interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated increases in transcription of the fibrinogen mRNA. The acute phase response can elevate plasma fibrinogen by 2- to 20-fold, with a peak elevation by three to five days and a gradual return to baseline following resolution of the inflammatory stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha suppress fibrinogen synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All three polypeptides (A&alpha;, B&beta;, and &gamma;) are synthesized by hepatocytes and are assembled into fibrinogen in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Carbohydrate side chains are added to the &beta; and &gamma; chains before the molecule is secreted into the plasma. Polymorphisms in the B&beta; gene have been described that are associated with increased plasma fibrinogen concentration, especially in smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16450711\" class=\"local\">'Acquired hyperfibrinogenemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Alternative splicing produces a normally occurring variant of the &gamma; chain, referred to as &quot;gamma-prime&quot; (&gamma;'), which yields &gamma;' fibrinogen when assembled into the fibrinogen molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. This variant, which constitutes approximately 8 to 15 percent of plasma fibrinogen, is associated with structural changes in fibrin clots that include more extensive cross-linking and greater resistance to lysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3339706283\"><span class=\"h2\">Functions in hemostasis and other processes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrinogen has numerous functional interactions and plays a pivotal role in hemostatic balance. Fibrinogen is the precursor to fibrin, and it binds platelets, supporting platelet aggregation, and thrombin, promoting coagulation. The fibrin clot serves as a template for the fibrinolytic system and forms a scaffold on which wound healing occurs. The final result of the balance between fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis determines whether the clinical manifestations include bleeding, thrombosis, both, or neither.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Formation of fibrin</strong> &ndash; Fibrinogen is the soluble precursor to fibrin, an insoluble protein that provides the major structural element of the clot. The conversion of fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin can be divided into three distinct steps:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Fibrinopeptide cleavage</strong> &ndash; Thrombin (factor IIa) is generated from the coagulation cascade (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Thrombin generation'</a>). When thrombin binds to fibrinogen, it cleaves fibrinopeptides A and B (FPA and FPB) from the N-terminal portions of the A&alpha; and B&beta; chains at the Arg16-Gly17 and the Arg14-Gly15 bonds, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68948 \">figure 1</a>). The resultant molecule is referred to as fibrin monomer, which is the basic unit of fibrin and facilitates optimal fibrin polymerization. FPA is released faster and earlier than FPB. FPA release is sufficient to induce clot formation, whereas isolated cleavage of FPB is insufficient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Any structural defect of the N-terminal region of the A&alpha; and B&beta; chains can markedly impair thrombin binding, FPA or FPB release, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the rate of fibrin formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is therefore not surprising that a high proportion of abnormal fibrinogens have mutations involving this region. Even so, the majority of the affected individuals are asymptomatic, although some have excessive bleeding manifestations, especially after surgery or childbirth. (See <a href=\"#H1512105416\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Fibrin polymerization</strong> &ndash; In normal hemostasis, release of negatively charged FPA and FPB results in spontaneous fibrin monomer polymerization to form the fibrin clot. Polymerization sites are located on the N-terminal portion of the A&alpha; and B&beta; chains (E domain), and the C-terminal portion of the &gamma; chains (D domain). The process is initiated by complementary noncovalent binding of the polymerization sites at the D region of one molecule to the central E domain of an adjacent fibrin monomer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68948 \">figure 1</a>), forming a two-molecule-thick strand or protofibril. This is followed by longitudinal growth (D-D contact between adjacent fibrin monomers) and branching to form the final fibrin network (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62012\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62012 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Mutations affecting these binding sites may delay fibrin polymerization and produce heterogeneous clinical manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H1512105416\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Fibrin cross-linking</strong> &ndash; Once polymerized, fibrin is cross-linked. This final step strengthens the clot against mechanical and enzymatic disruption. Cross-linking is mediated by the activated form of coagulation factor XIII (FXIIIa). Activation of FXIII is mediated by thrombin, after which FXIIIa binds to fibrin and generates covalent bonds between D domains of the fibrin fibers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62012\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62012 \">figure 2</a>). These bonds involve &gamma;-&gamma; as well as &alpha;-&alpha; and &alpha;-&gamma; chain interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Cross-linking stabilizes the clot and renders it resistant to disruption. Defective cross-linking due to an abnormal fibrinogen molecule may affect the mechanical resistance of the clot and be responsible for delayed wound healing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wound dehiscence, similar to that seen in patients with FXIII deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rare-inherited-coagulation-disorders#H4349864\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rare inherited coagulation disorders&quot;, section on 'Factor XIII deficiency (F13D)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Based on in vitro studies, it has been proposed that increased cross-linking might predispose to thromboembolic phenomena and cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. As noted above, clots containing &gamma;' fibrinogen may have greater cross-linking (see <a href=\"#H717012142\" class=\"local\">'Fibrinogen synthesis and circulating levels'</a> above), and observational studies have found higher circulating levels of &gamma;' fibrinogen (independent of circulating fibrinogen levels) in individuals with cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, there is no evidence of a clinically significant causative role.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Platelet aggregation</strong> &ndash; Fibrinogen facilitates platelet aggregation, although platelet aggregation may also occur in the absence of fibrinogen (eg, via von Willebrand factor [VWF]). The binding of fibrinogen to platelets to support platelet aggregation is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Platelet aggregation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fibrinolysis</strong> &ndash; The fibrin clot is a template for the assembly and activation of the fibrinolytic system; it includes binding sites for plasminogen, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), and &alpha;-2-antiplasmin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Clot dissolution and fibrinolysis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mutations affecting these binding regions may result in defective plasmin generation and reduced fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The rate of fibrinolysis is also influenced by the thickness of the fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, resistance to the action of plasmin can result from mutations in the C-terminus of the A&alpha; chain associated with abnormal albumin binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. These mechanisms explain the thrombophilic, rather than the hemorrhagic, phenotype in some of these individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombotic and hemorrhagic disorders due to abnormal fibrinolysis&quot;, section on 'The fibrinolytic system'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The locations have been mapped for certain amino acid residues that define the sites of some of the important functions of fibrinogen, including fibrinopeptide cleavage, fibrin polymerization, and factor XIIIa-mediated fibrin cross-linking as well as its interaction with platelet <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/23,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27-29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-biology#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet biology&quot;, section on 'Overview of platelet function'</a>.)</p><p>Fibrin also has a thrombin-neutralizing activity, and it has been proposed that hypofibrinogenemia or dysfibrinogenemia might increase the risk of thrombosis because thrombin activity is generated at a normal rate, but neutralization is decreased due to reduced functional fibrin, although further study is needed to explain observed thrombotic phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Reduced antithrombin activity and increased thrombin generation with platelet activation and VWF-mediated platelet aggregation may occur in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/2,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31,32</a>]. Resistance to fibrinolysis may contribute to some thrombotic phenotypes such as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) following pulmonary embolism. In a cohort of 33 patients with CTEPH, five were found to have dysfibrinogenemia with abnormal fibrin structure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> resistance to fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In addition to hemostasis, fibrinogen is involved in other physiologic processes. As an example, the fibrin clot serves as a template for stages of wound healing, as described separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-healing#H1330706697\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound healing&quot;, section on 'Epithelialization'</a>). During pregnancy, fibrinogen plays a fundamental role in maintaining the integrity of placental insertion. In a mouse model of homozygous, A&alpha; chain deficiency, fatal uterine bleeding occurs at approximately the tenth day of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. As discussed below, some patients with congenital fibrinogen disorders have an increased risk of pregnancy loss, obstetrical bleeding, or thrombosis during pregnancy or postpartum. (See <a href=\"#H2154716329\" class=\"local\">'Obstetric complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2490206628\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of fibrinogen abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disorders of fibrinogen can be inherited or acquired and can involve abnormalities in the amount of fibrinogen (quantitative defect), abnormalities in the function of the fibrinogen molecule (qualitative defect), or both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55144\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55144 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quantitative defects</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Afibrinogenemia</strong> &ndash; Absence of circulating fibrinogen due to a rare inherited autosomal recessive condition. Afibrinogenemia may be associated with bleeding, obstetric complications, and (rarely) thrombosis.

As discussed below, the threshold for clinical bleeding is &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (see <a href=\"#H4089240339\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding and abnormal clotting times'</a> below). Hypofibrinogenemia can be inherited or acquired (due to decreased synthesis or increased turnover [consumption]). Some individuals have phenotypes similar to afibrinogenemia; many affected individuals are asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H1392080744\" class=\"local\">'Congenital afibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Acquired hypo- or dysfibrinogenemia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hyperfibrinogenemia</strong> &ndash; Increased level of circulating fibrinogen (eg, &gt;450 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. Hyperfibrinogenemia is typically a transient, acquired finding that occurs in the setting of acute inflammation or injury (as an acute phase process) and often is observed as an incidental finding; routine testing for hyperfibrinogenemia is not advised.

It may also come to attention in an asymptomatic individual with unexplained prolonged baseline prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or in an individual with a known familial fibrinogen disorder. Testing for dysfibrinogenemia is often added as a second- or third-line evaluation for an individual with thrombosis after more common thrombophilias have been eliminated.

As a general rule, the TT and PT are more sensitive than the aPTT. Although the TT is a more sensitive screening test, its specificity is poor since there are other common causes for a prolonged TT. Similar to the TT, reptilase time (RT) is a useful screening test and is not affected by the presence of heparin; in some cases, prolongation of the RT may be more significant than the TT. If a mixing study has been done on one or more of these tests, it may show correction in the setting of afibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia but not dysfibrinogenemia because a functionally abnormal fibrinogen may act as an inhibitor in a mixing study.

The half-life of fibrinogen is usually 3 to 3.5 days (77 to 88 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Thus, as a general rule, plasma fibrinogen levels can be measured once per day (more frequently if increased or unexpected bleeding occurs); the interval may be extended as healing is completed. The amount of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinogen-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fibrinogen concentrate</a> in subsequent doses will be lower (approximately one-half to one-third the initial dose) since the patient's fibrinogen level will not return to zero between doses. A common dosing interval for postoperative management is every two to four days depending on the trough level and the underlying indication for replacement. If the trough level is too low, it is preferable to shorten the dosing interval (ie, give more frequent infusions) rather than increasing the amount of fibrinogen given in each dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-fibrinogen/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>Replacement guidelines for patients with dysfibrinogenemia are not well defined due to the heterogeneity of the phenotype and the greater risk of thrombosis.

During coagulation, fibrinogen is converted to fibrin, which polymerizes and contributes a major structural component of the clot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62012\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62012 \">figure 2</a>). Fibrin also supports platelet aggregation and serves as a template for the binding of thrombin, fibrinolytic proteins, wound healing, and placental implantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68948 \">figure 1</a>).

They include quantitative defects (afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia), qualitative defects (dysfibrinogenemia), and combined defects (hypodysfibrinogenemia). Databases of these variants are provided above. (See <a href=\"#H2649388011\" class=\"local\">'Inherited (genetic) defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired hypofibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia can be caused by a number of conditions such as liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Additional causes are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55144\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55144 \">table 1</a>) and discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Acquired abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormality of fibrinogen is usually characterized by prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombin time (TT), along with abnormally low plasma fibrinogen levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function. This may be encountered during the evaluation of unexplained bleeding or as an incidental finding (eg, if the individual is hospitalized for an unrelated reason) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F114456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114456 \">table 2</a>). Other manifestations of fibrinogen disorders may include thrombosis, obstetric complications, and other rare findings. (See <a href=\"#H1512105416\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of a suspected fibrinogen disorder includes a personal and family history of bleeding, thrombotic, and obstetric complications, laboratory testing of hemostasis, and fibrinogen level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F114258\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114258 \">algorithm 1</a>). Additional specialized testing may be indicated in some individuals; this is done in consultation with an expert in rare bleeding disorders and a specialized laboratory. Diagnosis is confirmed using both a functional and an immunoassay, which may show an abnormality in the plasma fibrinogen level <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of fibrinogen disorders includes other inherited and acquired bleeding and thrombotic disorders and other causes of pregnancy morbidity. Simultaneous prolongation of the PT, aPTT, and TT may be caused by anticoagulants (eg, heparins and direct thrombin inhibitors [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argatroban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">argatroban</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a>]), hypoalbuminemia, paraproteins in multiple myeloma and amyloidosis, and antibodies in patients exposed to bovine thrombin.

The higher range is used for more severe bleeding or more hemostatically challenging surgery. For intracerebral bleeding, a target of 150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is used. When fibrinogen replacement is required, we suggest use of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinogen-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fibrinogen concentrate</a> rather than other sources of fibrinogen such as Cryoprecipitate or plasma (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Fibrinogen concentrate carries a lower risk of adverse events (eg, transfusion reactions, volume overload) compared with plasma and Cryoprecipitate. Management of bleeding in most acquired fibrinogen disorders is more complex because other coagulation factors are also likely to be abnormal, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H174230803\" class=\"local\">'Acute bleeding'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1979341027\" class=\"local\">'Fibrinogen concentrate: Dosing and monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4032884770\" class=\"local\">'Cryoprecipitate and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP): Dosing and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elective surgery is managed in consultation with a hemostasis expert. Possible interventions to reduce the risk of bleeding in individuals with reduced fibrinogen activity may include fibrinogen replacement, fibrin glue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an antifibrinolytic agent. More aggressive thromboprophylaxis than usual (eg, with low molecular weight heparin) may be appropriate in individuals with thrombotic variants. (See <a href=\"#H4285507662\" class=\"local\">'Elective surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with fibrinogen disorders who have not had a prior episode of severe bleeding, we suggest not giving routine primary prophylaxis with fibrinogen in the absence of bleeding or surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). These individuals typically have a low risk of bleeding that often does not justify the costs and burdens of chronic prophylaxis. Secondary prophylaxis may be appropriate after a life-threatening bleeding event, and primary prophylaxis may be appropriate in selected individuals with a severe familial bleeding phenotype. For individuals who become pregnant or are treated with an anticoagulant, a period of prophylactic replacement may be reasonable, especially if functional fibrinogen levels are extremely low.
