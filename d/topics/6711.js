It is essential that clinicians interpreting these reports be familiar with the terminology used by their cytopathologist. A second review of indeterminate biopsies (FLUS, AUS, or follicular neoplasm) may be warranted, especially at low-volume centers.

Our approach to nodules with indeterminate cytologies outlined below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F116915\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116915 \">algorithm 1</a>) is consistent with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-thyroid-nodules-with-indeterminate-cytology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2920118939\"><span class=\"h2\">Follicular lesion or atypia of undetermined significance (FLUS/AUS)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytologic description</strong> &ndash; This category (Bethesda III) includes lesions with mild nuclear atypia, mixed macro- and microfollicular lesions where the proportion of macro- and microfollicles is similar, lesions with extensive oncocytic (H&uuml;rthle cell) change, and specimens that are compromised because of poor fixation or obscuring blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The original description of the term FLUS focused on the presence of microfollicles (architectural atypia), while AUS indicated nuclear atypia or H&uuml;rthle cell change. The 2017 revision of the Bethesda terminology specifically suggests that these terms be used interchangeably, and this classification is associated with a 10 to 30 percent risk of malignancy, yet in many centers, the percent risk of malignancy is higher with nuclear atypia than follicular architectural atypia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-thyroid-nodules-with-indeterminate-cytology/abstract/1,2,4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4-8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Follicular architectural atypia (FLUS) is commonly seen in nodular goiter (including autonomous nodules), follicular neoplasms, follicular cancer, follicular variant papillary cancer, and noninvasive follicular tumors with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). Nuclear atypia is commonly seen in hyperplastic nodular goiter, papillary cancer, follicular variant papillary cancer, and NIFTP. H&uuml;rthle cell change is seen in degenerating nodular goiter, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, H&uuml;rthle cell neoplasms, and H&uuml;rthle cell cancers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> &ndash; For patients with FLUS or AUS nodules with atypical cells or nodules with both macro- and microfollicular features, the approach varies with institutional practices and availability of molecular testing:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Many centers collect an extra fine-needle aspiration (FNA) sample at the time of the initial biopsy to be used for molecular testing should the cytology be read as FLUS or AUS. Further management then depends on the results of molecular testing.

However, for patients with nodules that have only mild architectural atypia, ie, are greater than 50 percent macrofollicular fragments (flat sheets with uniform, noncrowded cells) without suspicious sonographic features and in whom there are no risk factors for thyroid cancer (childhood head and neck radiation, family history), an alternative option is monitoring. We typically obtain a follow-up thyroid ultrasound in 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In some centers, a radionuclide scan is obtained if repeat aspirates continue to show only architectural atypia FLUS and the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> (see <a href=\"#H477804131\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid scintigraphy'</a> below).

Previously, the response of a nodule to T4-suppressive therapy was used to select nodules that required excision: nodules that shrank were assumed to be benign, and those that failed to shrink were excised to exclude malignancy. However, this approach is not very specific, since only 17 to 25 percent of nodules regress when T4 is administered (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid hormone suppressive therapy for thyroid nodules and benign goiter&quot;</a>).

Many centers collect an extra FNA sample at the time of the initial biopsy to be used for molecular testing should the cytology be read as follicular neoplasm. If an extra FNA sample was not obtained, FNA is repeated in 6 to 12 weeks, or earlier, to obtain a sample for molecular testing. Further management then depends on the results of molecular testing.

Before utilizing these expensive tests, one should also consider the sonographic characteristics and the size of the nodule, the degree of patient concern, and the availability of follow-up imaging, as well as the patient's candidacy for surgery. The negative and positive predictive values noted above are highly dependent on the prevalence of thyroid cancer in any clinician's cytologically indeterminate nodule population, with the negative predictive value decreasing as the cancer prevalence increases. Thus, the negative predictive value of a benign test is more reliable the lower the risk of malignancy in patients with indeterminate nodules, and it is optimal when the prevalence is &lt;30 percent. It would be helpful if the prevalence of malignancy in indeterminate nodules were known for the institution in which the patient is being evaluated, but this information is rarely available. The decision to observe a patient with a benign profile using ultrasound surveillance should be reassessed as more data regarding the reliability of these tests become available.

The choice of lobectomy versus total thyroidectomy may depend on tumor size, the specific mutation, patient preference, and the presence of nodes or contralateral nodules on ultrasound.

A subnormal serum TSH, indicating overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism, increases the possibility that a thyroid nodule is hyperfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely are cancer, a nodule that is hyperfunctioning on radioiodine imaging does not require repeat (or even initial) FNA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;, section on 'Thyroid scintigraphy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2323848338\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radionuclide scanning should be performed in patients with a thyroid nodule and a subnormal TSH concentration to determine if the nodule is hyperfunctioning. Thyroid hormone production from some autonomous nodules may suppress TSH only within the lower portion of the normal range (eg, &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>. Scintigraphy may also be informative in such patients, especially if prior TSH levels were subnormal, or when the results of an FNA suggest FLUS due to architectural atypia or a follicular neoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2991120243\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonfunctioning nodule</strong> &ndash; For patients with indeterminate cytology who have a nonfunctioning nodule, we suggest molecular testing (see <a href=\"#H3088942949\" class=\"local\">'Molecular markers'</a> above). If molecular testing is not available, we suggest diagnostic lobectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autonomous nodule</strong> &ndash; Since hyperfunctioning (autonomous) nodules rarely are cancer, a nodule that is hyperfunctioning on radioiodine imaging does not require repeat FNA or assessment with molecular markers. Patients with hyperfunctioning nodules are followed (repeat ultrasound in 12 to 24 months to assess stability), or if the patient is hyperthyroid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methimazole</a>, radioiodine therapy, or surgery is advised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-toxic-adenoma-and-toxic-multinodular-goiter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indeterminate nodule</strong> &ndash; Because scintigraphy is two dimensional, its limitations result from the superimposition of abnormal nodular tissue and normally functioning thyroid tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72057\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72057 \">image 1</a>). Autonomous nodules that do not make sufficient thyroid hormone to suppress serum TSH concentrations may appear indeterminate on thyroid scintigraphy. Smaller nodules may also appear indeterminate on thyroid scintigraphy. They could represent either small, nonfunctioning nodules anterior or posterior to normally functioning thyroid tissue or autonomous nodules that do not produce sufficient thyroid hormone to suppress TSH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51029\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51029 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These indeterminate nodules should <strong>not</strong> be referred to as warm or functioning, since the majority are, in fact, nonfunctioning nodules. Some UpToDate authors and editors obtain suppression scans in appropriate patients for further evaluation, whereas others proceed directly to molecular testing (see <a href=\"#H2663339032\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation'</a> above) or diagnostic lobectomy if molecular testing is not available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Suppression scanning is most commonly indicated in patients who have an indeterminate nodule on radionuclide scan and an FNA that was interpreted as an FLUS with architectural atypia (microfollicles) or as a follicular neoplasm (microfollicular) since these cytologic findings may be associated with autonomous nodules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atlas of thyroid cytopathology&quot;, section on 'Follicular neoplasm/microfollicular cytology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During a suppression scan, patients are given thyroid hormone in a dose sufficient to suppress TSH secretion, and a second scan is done once TSH suppression is documented, which may occur in one to two weeks or may require several dose adjustments. Suppression can usually be accomplished by administering T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>) (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> for 10 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-thyroid-nodules-with-indeterminate-cytology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Uptake of radioiodine will be low or undetectable in nonautonomous tissue but persist in autonomous tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67109\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67109 \">image 3</a>). If the region of nonsuppressible uptake corresponds to the sonographic or palpable nodule, then the nodule can be assumed to be autonomous and benign. Patients with autonomously functioning nodules may become hyperthyroid with even small doses of T4 and should be warned of hyperthyroid symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-thyroid-nodules-with-indeterminate-cytology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The risk of malignancy with these cytologic classifications ranges from 10 to 40 percent. (See <a href=\"#H2584177462\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with FLUS or AUS nodules with atypical cells or nodules with both macro- and microfollicular features, the approach varies with institutional practices and availability of molecular testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F116915\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116915 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2920118939\" class=\"local\">'Follicular lesion or atypia of undetermined significance (FLUS/AUS)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One option is to repeat the FNA after a 6- to 12-week interval (or earlier). If repeat aspirates continue to show <span class=\"nowrap\">FLUS/AUS,</span> molecular testing is performed. As an alternative, many centers collect an extra sample at the time of the initial biopsy to be used for molecular testing should the cytology be read as FLUS or AUS (see <a href=\"#H3088942949\" class=\"local\">'Molecular markers'</a> above). For patients with FLUS due to architectural atypia (microfollicles), some experts first perform thyroid scintigraphy if not previously obtained, particularly if the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is in the lower end of the normal range (eg, less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>. Molecular testing is then performed only for patients with nonfunctioning nodules. (See <a href=\"#H477804131\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid scintigraphy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If molecular testing is unavailable and repeat aspirates continue to show atypical cells, we suggest surgical resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with nodules that are greater than 50 percent macrofollicular, we suggest monitoring, unless they are clinically suspicious or present in patients with a higher risk of cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2920118939\" class=\"local\">'Follicular lesion or atypia of undetermined significance (FLUS/AUS)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with follicular neoplasms (Bethesda IV, microfollicular adenomas), we send the FNA aspirate for molecular testing (if available) using a genomic sequencing classifier (GSC) or mutational analysis with an expanded panel of point mutations and gene fusions or combined micro mRNA (miRNA) expression and mutational analysis testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F116915\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116915 \">algorithm 1</a>). Some experts first perform thyroid scintigraphy if not previously obtained, particularly if the TSH is in the lower end of the normal range (eg, less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>. Molecular testing is then performed only for patients with nonfunctioning nodules. (See <a href=\"#H1380981964\" class=\"local\">'Follicular neoplasm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If molecular testing is not available, we suggest diagnostic lobectomy rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In the absence of capsular or vascular invasion (on surgical histology), the lesion is classified as a benign adenoma or noninvasive follicular tumors with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) and no further treatment is required. For patients whose surgical histology shows follicular thyroid<strong> </strong>cancer (or follicular variant papillary thyroid cancer), completion thyroidectomy may be necessary in selected patients who require radioiodine. (See <a href=\"#H1380981964\" class=\"local\">'Follicular neoplasm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with indeterminate FNA cytology who have a benign molecular pattern on molecular testing, we suggest observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, the decision to observe a patient with a benign profile should be reassessed as more data become available. Diagnostic lobectomy remains an alternative option for patients with a benign molecular pattern, depending upon the nodule's clinical characteristics and patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H3088942949\" class=\"local\">'Molecular markers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2663339032\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a suspicious molecular pattern using these techniques, diagnostic lobectomy or total thyroidectomy is indicated.
