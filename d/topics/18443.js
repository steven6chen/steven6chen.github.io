For these women, alternative pathways to parenthood have included adoption or foster parenting and, in countries where available, use of a gestational carrier. However, gestational surrogacy has limited availability worldwide and, for some women, the desire to carry and birth a child make the option of uterus transplantation appealing. This topic will discuss the ethics, indications, and patient selection for uterus transplantation, an experimental approach to restoring fertility in women with absolute uterine factor infertility. The purpose of this topic is to provide information on this developing technology for clinicians and patients; the topic is not intended to be used for treatment decisions.</p><p>Specific discussion of the procedures for uterus transplantation and general issues related to organ transplantation can be found in the following topics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-surgery-immunosuppression-and-obstetric-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterus transplantation for absolute uterine factor infertility: Surgery, immunosuppression, and obstetric management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-immunosuppressive-agents-used-for-prevention-and-treatment-of-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of immunosuppressive agents used for prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3112229210\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE OVERVIEW AND HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterus transplantation is a highly experimental procedure to treat absolute uterine factor infertility. Once the intended uterus recipient and organ donor have been identified, the process begins with in vitro fertilization (IVF) to create and freeze embryos for the intended recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Next the organ donor undergoes a radical-type hysterectomy followed by implantation of the donor organ into the recipient. After at least 12 months of immunosuppressive treatment, the recipient undergoes embryo transfer, pregnancy, and, if the pregnancy is successful, delivery via cesarean delivery. At the conclusion of childbearing, the transplanted organ is removed to avoid the need for lifelong immunosuppression.</p><p>The first human uterus transplantation was performed in 2000 in Saudi Arabia, with a uterus from a living donor, and reported to the public in 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This attempt resulted in uterus removal three months after transplantation because of necrosis. Necrosis may have been related to the surgical preparation of the donor uterus; the short pedicles of the uterine arteries and veins were elongated with saphenous vein grafts.</p><p>The second human uterus transplantation was performed in 2011 in Turkey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A 21-year-old women with uterine agenesis received a uterus from a 23-year-old deceased woman. During the organ harvesting surgery, the uterus was prioritized as the first organ to be flushed and removed, with the goal of minimizing damage from warm ischemic time. The patient has conceived at least two pregnancies, but both ended in early miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. It is not known if other pregnancies were conceived or if the organ has been removed.</p><p>Since these initial reports, uterus transplantation has been successfully performed in Sweden and the United States, and attempted in the Czech Republic, China, Brazil, and Germany. In 2014, the first live birth occurred, from a uterus transplanted by the Swedish team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The 35-year-old recipient had congenital absence of the uterus (Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome) and received a uterus from a living, 61-year-old woman who had previously had two live births. Prior to the transplantation, the patient and her male partner underwent IVF to create embryos and also confirm that conception was possible for the recipient. Approximately one year after the uterus transplantation, the patient then underwent transfer of one previously frozen embryo. A male infant was subsequently born at 31 weeks of gestation via cesarean delivery. Additional live births from uteri transplanted by the Swedish team have since occurred, including a birth for a woman who received a uterus from her own mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

MRKH syndrome accounts for less than 3 percent of all M&uuml;llerian malformations and has an estimated prevalence of 1:4500 females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Females with MRKH syndrome have a normal karyotype, and they can have normal offspring without urogenital malformations when they pursue surrogacy using their own eggs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Approximately 600,000 procedures are performed annually in the United States alone, with more than 40 percent of the surgeries occurring in women under 44 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Uterus transplantation could be considered for these women only when all other therapeutic options have failed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>M&uuml;llerian malformations</strong> &ndash; Congenital uterine malformations occur because of disturbances during fetal life in the formation, development, or fusion of the M&uuml;llerian (paramesonephric) ducts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81036 \">figure 1</a>). These malformations can increase the risk of adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes as well as cause infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A summary of the estimated prevalence of the most frequent M&uuml;llerian malformations and their potential impact on fertility is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110955\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110955 \">table 1</a>). Further information and comprehensive reviews of uterus malformations and their management can be found separately.

Intrauterine adhesions accompanied by symptoms (eg, infertility, amenorrhea) are also referred to as Asherman syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Asherman syndrome occurs in approximately 1.5 percent of reproductive-age women. Of affected women, approximately 50 percent have infertility and, for those who do conceive, approximately 40 percent miscarry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The main treatment is hysteroscopic adhesiolysis, which varies in efficacy from 30 to 90 percent, depending on the severity of the adhesions. Thus, approximately 30 percent of affected women are unable to conceive and could potentially be candidates for hysterectomy followed by uterus transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-adhesions-clinical-manifestation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine adhesions: Clinical manifestation and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiation injury</strong> &ndash; Radiotherapy, given either as total body irradiation or as local irradiation of the pelvis, causes up to a 60 percent reduction in uterine volume that is irreversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. This volume reduction contributes to an inability to conceive, increased rate of early miscarriage, and increased rate of late pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Radiation therapy also causes scarring, adhesions, and impaired healing, which may make these women suboptimal candidates for uterus transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Moreover, the gonadotoxic effects of radiation on the ovaries, and the possible need for oocyte donation, have to be taken into consideration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infertility and pregnancy outcome in cancer survivors&quot;, section on 'Risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, growth restriction, stillbirth'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Repeated unsuccessful implantation </strong>&ndash; Endometrial receptivity refers to the transient state when the uterine epithelium is suitable for blastocyst attachment and implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Endometrial receptivity during the window of implantation (WOI) is crucial for achieving pregnancy. Infertility can result when endometrial receptivity is not synchronized with the WOI. While in vitro fertilization with individually-timed embryo transfer can overcome this discrepancy in most women, approximately 25 percent of women remain infertile and thus would be candidates for hysterectomy and uterus transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myoma not requiring hysterectomy</strong> &ndash; Uterine leiomyomas (ie, fibroids) are more common in women with infertility than in the general population (27 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Submucous and intramural fibroids are associated with decreased implantation and pregnancy rates; the impact of subserosal fibroids on fertility is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. One meta-analysis of 11 studies reported a 21 percent relative reduction in live birth rate for women with non-distorting fibroids compared with women without fibroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

As gestational surrogacy and adoption both exist as alternative paths to parenthood for women with absolute uterine factor infertility, even though they are not available in all regions of the world, the ethics of performing uterine transplantation are considered in comparison with these two established options. However, these options differ from uterus transplantation in that adoption does not allow a genetic link between the mother and child and neither adoption nor surrogacy allows the women to have the emotional and physical experiences of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, the risks to a gestational surrogate must be considered.</p><p>While the Montreal Criteria published in 2012 provided a theoretical framework to guide uterus transplantation, the recommendations were limited because they could not address the practical issues of the still-developing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Uterus transplantation is unique in that the rights of multiple parties must be considered and balanced: the living donor or the immediate family of a deceased donor, the recipient, the genetic father (if partnered with the uterus recipient), and the intended child(ren). Major ethical issues specific to uterus transplantation include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterus transplantation is considered a life-enhancing, rather than life-saving, surgery, similar to transplantation of a face, limb, abdominal wall, trachea, or larynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thus, greater justification is required compared with life-saving transplantation procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The procedure is considered investigational and requires unique informed consents for the donor, recipient, and potentially the intended genetic father. As with any developing technology, there is a potential for therapeutic misconception during the informed consent process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterus transplantation is the first temporary transplant procedure, as the organ is removed after childbearing to avoid lifelong immunosuppression. However, as the organ is part of the recipient once transplantation is complete, removal requires consent of the participant herself.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of the procedure is not fully known. In the Swedish uterus transplantation trial, nine women with absolute uterine factor infertility were accepted into the trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Two of the women who underwent transplantation had their grafts removed within the first six months. Of the remaining seven women who underwent uterus transplantation, as of February 2017, there has been a 100 percent clinical pregnancy rate and six healthy babies have been delivered. There are not yet enough cases to know if this pregnancy rate is typical or to know the term live birth rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The organ recipient will undergo three to four abdominal surgeries, including the transplant itself, cesarean delivery (or deliveries), and hysterectomy once childbearing is complete.

Advantages of a living donor include ample time for preoperative testing, screening, and assembly of a multi-specialty surgical team. Moreover, the donor and recipient have time to minimize the influence of modifiable risk factors such as smoking and excess weight. In the Swedish research protocol, five of the donors were mothers of the recipients, which improves the likelihood of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match as well as confirms a reproductively functional uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The main benefit of deceased-donor transplantation is that the surgical risk for the donor no longer exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/1,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36</a>]. In addition, a more radical dissection can be performed on a deceased donor, which allows recovery of larger vessels and thus potentially reduces the risk of graft thrombosis. The ovaries and ovarian vessels can also be removed.</p><p>Disadvantages of a deceased-donor organ include the limited availability of organs, unpredictable timing of organ procurement, and potential ethical uncertainties regarding consent. It is not possible to know if a deceased donor considered the implications of uterus transplantation while alive because of the experimental nature of the procedure.

Pregnancy, especially if preeclampsia develops, is likely to have an additional negative effect on GFR. However, it is likely that part of the decrease in GFR during the time on immunosuppression, and possibly pregnancy, will be reversed when the patient is taken off immunosuppression after hysterectomy following the birth of child(ren).

The rationale for the first two criteria was that they did not want to transplant a structurally normal uterus that is not fully functional for reproduction. They also limited the number of cesarean deliveries in the donor to one, via transverse lower-uterine segment incision, because of the increased risk of abnormal placentation (placenta previa and accreta) and risk of uterine rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

In the research trial, the uterus donor and recipient underwent similar testing, but different psychologists evaluated each woman. The organ recipient must have the mental capacity to undergo IVF, multiple surgeries, immunosuppressive treatment, and the challenges of pregnancy, all for a procedure that is not life-saving. In addition, the recipient must be prepared for the possibility that the graft could fail, she could have complications requiring graft removal (including termination of a viable pregnancy), or she could have a successful transplant but still not achieve a live birth. Despite these challenges, preliminary data suggests that patients and their partners remain psychologically stable throughout the process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterus-transplantation-for-absolute-uterine-factor-infertility-ethics-patient-selection-and-consent/abstract/48,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,51</a>].

CMV and EBV infections are relative contraindications, particularly if the donor is positive but the recipient is negative. Transmission of CMV via an infected organ can cause fever, pneumonia, gastrointestinal ulceration, hepatitis, and graft dysfunction. EBV-infected B-cells may proliferate uncontrollably during T-cell immunosuppression, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) can result. PTLD can occur when the transplant recipient experiences a primary EBV infection or in reactivated infections.

Waiting to perform IVF until after transplant surgery could be more challenging because of the distorted anatomy (particularly vascular).</p><p>The consent process for IVF is fairly standardized and is not specifically impacted by the inclusion of IVF in a uterus transplantation protocol. The consent for the genetic father mainly pertains to the IVF treatments that he must undergo to create embryos prior to uterus transplantation. The legal rights of the genetic father in relation to the embryos varies by country. In addition, the woman undergoing IVF is informed about the usual risks, including bleeding, injury, infection, and development of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The patient (and her partner, if applicable) is also informed that lack of fertilization or poor embryo development could occur. In such cases, donor oocytes may be required to create an embryo.</p><p>Of note, spontaneous conception after uterus transplantation was not possible in the initial trial because the fallopian tubes were not transplanted as part of the graft. This decision was made with the goal of reducing the risk of ectopic pregnancy, particularly an interstitial pregnancy. Concern exists that the oviducts could sustain ischemic damage during the transplantation process, which could then increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy in the setting of spontaneous conception. Were an ectopic pregnancy to develop, it would be extremely difficult to treat laparoscopically because dense adhesions typically form lateral to the uterus. In addition, it is not clear that the oviducts would be functional because the ovaries are lateral to the external iliac vessels in women with uterine agenesis, and the distance between the ovaries and the fallopian tubes may be too great to allow the fimbriated ends to pick up an ovulated oocyte.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3959043391\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterus transplantation is a complex, multi-step procedure for the treatment of absolute uterine factor infertility (AUFI). AUFI refers to infertility that is fully attributable to the uterus because of absence (congenital or surgical) or abnormalities (anatomic or functional) that prevent embryo implantation or completion of a pregnancy to term. (See <a href=\"#H3112229210\" class=\"local\">'Procedure overview and history'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2234035391\" class=\"local\">'Absolute uterine factor infertility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keys ethical points in considering uterus transplantation include the non-life-saving nature of the procedure; existence of proven alternatives; the experimental nature of uterus transplantation; and the risks and benefits to the donor, recipient, and developing fetus. While gestational surrogacy and adoption both exist as alternative paths to parenthood, these options are not available in all regions of the world. (See <a href=\"#H3430596340\" class=\"local\">'Ethical issues of uterus transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uterus donor may be alive or deceased. Advantages of living donors include larger potential supply of organs and ample time for preoperative testing, screening, and assembly of a multi-specialty surgical team. The main disadvantage is the extensive pelvic surgery for organ removal. Use of deceased donors avoids the donor's surgical risk and allows for a more extensive graft harvest. Disadvantages of a deceased-donor organ include the limited availability of organs, unpredictable timing of organ procurement, potential that the donor uterus has not yet produced a term pregnancy, and potential ethical uncertainties regarding consent. (See <a href=\"#H1707217481\" class=\"local\">'Use of living or deceased donor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As human uterus transplantation is in the beginning stages, the optimal inclusion and exclusion criteria for both donors and recipients are not yet known. Living donors and recipients undergo extensive testing to ensure medical and psychological appropriateness. The authors&rsquo; protocol includes consultation by the following services: gynecology, transplantation surgery, psychology, clinical immunology, anesthesiology, internal medicine, and radiology. (See <a href=\"#H2613077261\" class=\"local\">'Selection and evaluation of recipient and donor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to removal, the donor uterus is evaluated with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (if technically possible) to estimate the size of the uterus, rule out uterine pathology, exclude M&uuml;llerian anomalies, and evaluate the vasculature. (See <a href=\"#H1329707507\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of uterus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals for the evaluation of the future genetic father are to exclude male-factor causes of infertility, exclude infectious diseases that could be transmitted to the immunosuppressed mother, and to identify relationship challenges that could negatively impact the outcome of uterus transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H4127097900\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of genetic father'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As part of the informed consent process, the uterus donor must be free from coercion; be fully informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives for both the donor and the recipient; have access to an independent donor advocate; and be informed of the early and late surgical risks. The uterus recipient must be educated to the risks and benefits of uterus transplantation and then consented for the multiple steps of the process that will ultimately result in a live-born child, including gonadotropin stimulation, egg retrieval for the creation of embryos, uterus transplantation, immunosuppression, embryo transfer, pregnancy, cesarean delivery, and uterus removal. The consent for the genetic father mainly pertains to the in vitro fertilization treatments that he must undergo to create embryos prior to uterus transplantation.
