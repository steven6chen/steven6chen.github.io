Abnormalities sufficient to prompt evaluation (excluding uncomplicated cases of cryptorchidism and hypospadias) occur in approximately one in 1000 to 4500 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. </p><p>The birth of an infant with atypical genitalia presents a unique set of challenging management issues. This is because psychosexual development is influenced by multiple factors including the genes involved in sexual development, gender differences in brain structure, prenatal androgen exposure, societal and cultural factors, and family dynamics. In the past, decisions about sex of rearing were usually based on potential for reproduction and traditional sexual function and were often accompanied by irreversible genital surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Long-term outcome data are now available to help predict gender identity for many infants with DSDs and provide insight into appropriate early management decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Nonetheless, there is ongoing controversy about some aspects of management, especially for certain types of DSDs for which gender identity remain unpredictable. Thus, uncertainties about adult outcome, gender of rearing, and timing of surgery should contribute to discussions and informed decision-making by the parents. Each child and family will have unique characteristics so that all decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>The management of infants with clinically significant DSD will be discussed here. The evaluation of these infants is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the infant with atypical genitalia (disorder of sex development)&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25706124\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the term DSD has been accepted by the medical community, patients and support groups question its usefulness and appropriateness based on three criticisms: first, that DSD is an overly broad term that applies to conditions in which no <span class=\"nowrap\">sexual/gender</span> disruption is expected (eg, Turner syndrome, Trisomy X, and others); second, that this broad term lacks sufficient specificity to be helpful diagnostically; and third, that the use of the word 'disorder' is seen as pejorative by some. Many of these groups do not accept the DSD designation and feel that it should be abandoned by the medical community. </p><p>Until a consensus is reached on this issue, we will use the term DSD but will employ it only in relation to those patients in whom there is altered physical sexual differentiation (conditions previously captured by the term &quot;intersex&quot;). Many of these individuals present as newborns with an atypical genital appearance previously termed &quot;ambiguous genitalia.&quot; We will not use DSD to refer to conditions in which <span class=\"nowrap\">genital/gender</span> discordance is not expected, such as Klinefelter syndrome, undescended testes, or all but the most severe forms of hypospadias. In many patients who present with atypical genitalia it is now possible to make an accurate diagnosis in a timely fashion, thereby avoiding the use of the term DSD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2017575660\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF DSD WITH ATYPICAL GENITALIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management depends on the type of DSD and degree of genital atypia. The initial management of the patient, including surveillance for adrenal crisis and family coping, occurs concurrently with the diagnostic process, which is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the infant with atypical genitalia (disorder of sex development)&quot;</a>.) </p><p>For the purposes of management, it is helpful to categorize the DSDs that present with atypical genitalia into five major groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57610 \">table 1</a>), listed here in decreasing order of frequency: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common form of DSD presenting with atypical genitalia and a 46,XX karyotype in the newborn period is classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This is a relatively homogenous group of patients, most of whom present in the newborn period with atypical genitalia due to endogenous virilization and without palpable gonads. Rarely, 46,XX individuals with CAH present with normal male genitalia but without palpable gonads. In the past, these individuals were usually diagnosed later in life after being raised as males. Mandatory newborn screening in the United States allows for early detection of almost all cases of classical CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, usually within the first week of life. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second most common form of DSD with atypical genitalia is <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XY</span> mosaicism. Those with atypical genitalia typically have hypospadias (often severe), a descended (but infertile) testis on the right side, and a streak gonad with retained m&uuml;llerian remnants on the contralateral side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60214\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60214 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106091\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106091 \">image 1</a>); this phenotype is often described as &quot;mixed gonadal dysgenesis&quot; in the literature. It is unclear why the testicular tissue is usually found on the right side. The phenotype of this condition is highly variable, ranging from phenotypically normal males (about 90 percent of patients, often undiagnosed), to males with gonadal dysgenesis, to those with female genitalia and Turner syndrome-like features. The specific presentation appears to be related to the degree of mosaicism in the gonad and its consequent hormonal function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other rare forms of DSDs presenting with atypical genitalia are: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>46,XY DSD, such as 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17-beta HSD) deficiency, 5-alpha reductase deficiency, and androgen receptor insensitivity, as well as patients with blocks in androgen synthesis and gene deletions affecting testicular development (eg, sex-determining region on the Y chromosome [SRY], steroidogenic factor 1 [SF-1], and Wilms tumor 1 [WT-1]). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>46,XY DSD with severe genital anomalies (such as some children with micropenis, penile agenesis, and cloacal exstrophy), which are not associated with presently identified gene or chromosome abnormalities (ie, &quot;non-hormonal&quot; DSD). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ovotesticular DSD (previously known as true hermaphroditism), which refers to the presence of ovarian tissue with follicles, and testicular tissue with seminiferous tubules, in the same individual. </p><p/><p>Management for each of these disorders is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Decisions about sex of rearing and surgery'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL STABILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial stabilization of infants with a DSD presenting with atypical genitalia requires attention to both medical and psychosocial issues. The most important medical issue is the possibility of life-threatening adrenal crisis in infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The urgent psychosocial issue arises from the anxiety experienced by most parents whose child is born with atypical genitalia. Uncertainty about the most appropriate sex of rearing complicates or delays the traditional announcement of whether the child is a boy or girl to family members, friends, and community. The period of uncertainty is inevitable because of the time required to make an accurate diagnosis and develop a thoughtful treatment plan. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of adrenal crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CAH due to 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) deficiency (<a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/201910&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWJ1Im12MhefvEUl0mPrBSt+npukzJBPpht7xU4tsW+RX&amp;TOPIC_ID=5807\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #201910</a>) is the most common cause of 46,XX DSD (virilization) and has a significant risk for salt-wasting adrenal crisis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107536 \">table 2</a>). Adrenal crisis also may occur in some other types of CAH, including 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency. If salt-wasting CAH is not diagnosed and treated, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, and hypovolemic shock can occur, typically between 10 to 20 days of life. </p><p>Therefore, any infant with atypical genitalia and nonpalpable gonads (and infants with a positive neonatal screen for CAH) should be presumed to have CAH and monitored for salt loss and adrenal crisis until the diagnosis is excluded. Blood samples should be urgently obtained for steroid hormone precursors (most importantly, 17-hydroxyprogesterone) to evaluate for CAH; serum and urine electrolytes and plasma glucose should be monitored. </p><p>Laboratory findings suggesting salt-wasting crisis include hyperkalemia with or without hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A rapid overview guiding the recognition and treatment of adrenal crisis is shown in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61357 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Management in neonates'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Is it a boy or a girl? Family coping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The birth of an infant with atypical genitalia can be a psychosocial emergency for the family. An appropriate therapeutic plan can be developed only with the full participation of the parents after a careful and complete evaluation by an experienced team of endocrinologists, geneticists, and surgeons, aided by individuals capable of providing sophisticated psychosocial support. The period of uncertainty before a specific diagnosis can be established is a particularly challenging time for the parents. In the rarer forms of DSD presenting with atypical genitalia, this can be an extended process because of the multiple diagnostic steps required and because less information is available about these diagnoses to reliably predict outcomes. Even with optimal education and support, parents and family may experience significant stress and difficulty in adjusting to the diagnosis before they are capable of making thoughtful and informed decisions about management. </p><p>In these discussions, the emphasis should be on helping the parents understand that the atypical genital appearance, although uncommon, is biologically understandable (in the overwhelming majority of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The genitalia can be described to the parents as &quot;not being fully formed&quot; or being &quot;overly developed.&quot; It is helpful to summarize the embryology of genital development, including the presence of indeterminate external genitalia in the early stages of fetal development, followed by subsequent maturation toward male or female typical genitalia. This discussion should be tailored to the educational background and emotional capacity of the family, and special needs caused by the family's cultural or religious background should be identified and addressed. In the early stages of communication, the provider should take care to avoid overly technical descriptions of the problem, which can both contribute to the family's emotional stress and discourage additional questions from the family.</p><p>We generally suggest to the families that they consider postponing birth announcements describing the sex of the infant until they are sure about the sex in which they intend to rear the child. Similarly, the birth certificate should not be completed until the diagnosis and planned sex of rearing are determined. If the diagnosis is clear (eg, virilization in a girl with 21-hydroxylase deficiency), then a family can comfortably announce the sex. When the diagnosis will be delayed several days or months until diagnostic testing is complete, the family will require counseling and support to be able to postpone the birth announcement about the baby's sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Many families, even the most sophisticated, feel guilty that they are in some way responsible for the genital malformation. This must be discussed openly; the discussion will differ depending upon the nature of the disorder. If the child is known to have a gene defect, the defect and its manifestations must be described so that the family can learn about and cope with the disorder as it is understood, with full disclosure regarding the degree of uncertainty in outcome associated with the specific diagnosis.</p><p>Families of children with atypical genitalia often wish to discuss issues of long-term reproductive function and sexuality early in the evaluation. These issues should be discussed in a frank and open way; discussion should be facilitated by appropriate members of the health care team, within the limits of family understanding and availability of data concerning the outcomes of the specific diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Further evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial stabilization, infants with DSDs should be thoroughly evaluated to establish an accurate diagnosis because this information will be an important guide for management. The types of DSD and steps in the evaluation are discussed in detail separately. The infant should also be evaluated for other nongenital abnormalities that might suggest a syndromic form of DSD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the infant with atypical genitalia (disorder of sex development)&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Given the complexity of DSD diagnoses and the infrequency with which they are seen, affected infants should be evaluated and managed at centers with experienced DSD teams, if possible. If it is not possible to transfer the infant to a DSD center for evaluation, consultation should be sought with a DSD team to help organize and facilitate management. In response to the consensus conference on the management of DSDs in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], several groups published useful information on the development of collaborative management teams in Western Europe and in North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. DSD centers are generally different from centers that manage children and adults with gender dysphoria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DECISIONS ABOUT SEX OF REARING AND SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For some DSDs, decisions about sex of rearing and surgery are straightforward. For others, management decisions remain challenging for providers and family, as outlined below. </p><p>Long-term outcomes should be judged by the presence of psychosexual and psychosocial well-being and an ability to positively contribute to society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In some cases, the child's gender role behavior and gender identity may not be fixed until early adulthood or even later. In addition, it is now well-recognized that gender identity may not be purely binary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29659863\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of decisions about sex of rearing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In accord with available data, guidance given to families about sex of rearing should be based to a large extent upon the most probable adult gender identity and the potential for adult psychosexual and psychosocial function, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57610 \">table 1</a>). Factors to be considered in this decision include the specific DSD diagnosis, the degree of virilization as a marker of prenatal androgen exposure, the potential for adult sexual function and fertility, the likely gender identity (for those disorders where this has been established in long-term studies), and the family's socio-cultural background and expectations. The relevance of these factors is supported by an increasing number of studies examining gender identity in a variety of DSDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. All of these factors must be assessed in every patient, regardless of the type of DSD. Decisions about sex of rearing are ideally made by an informed family after careful evaluation, documentation, and consultation. </p><p>For some DSDs (eg, congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH] in a 46,XX individual), gender identity is reasonably predictable and psychosocial outcome is generally positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In this case, the information can be communicated to the family with confidence and decisions about sex of rearing are straightforward. However, it is important to note that gender dysphoria has been reported in a minority of 46,XX CAH patients, particularly in those with severe virilization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those in whom the diagnosis is delayed.</p><p>In contrast, for patients with one of the less common forms of 46,XY DSDs, adult gender identity is variable and difficult to predict. In these cases, we discuss the concept of an evolving gender identity, which recognizes that future gender identity is not entirely predictable at birth and may evolve as the child grows. We encourage parents or caregivers to assume a supportive role in the sex assignment but remain flexible enough to permit the child to manifest his or her gender identity as they mature. We discuss this concept with families whose children have uncertain gender outcomes in order to assist in decisions about sex of rearing and surgery. While we endorse the flexibility inherent to this concept, we also recognize that this approach remains untested and unproven in the management of children with DSD. Further, we recognize that the family will bear the major burden of rearing a child with atypical genitalia. For this reason, we respect the family's right and responsibility to make the decisions regarding sex of rearing and timing of surgery. After providing detailed and sensitive counseling, we support the parents or caregivers in their decisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492151130\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of decisions about surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, surgery to restore normal female anatomy in girls with CAH was performed early in childhood. The goal of surgery is to restore functional female anatomy by separating the vagina from the urethra and bringing the vagina out to the perineum. DSD advocacy groups have recommended that all genital surgery be deferred until the child is old enough to confirm his or her gender identity and can make an informed decision about surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An advantage of deferring surgery is that it keeps options open for virilized 46,XX females, in case they turn out to have a male gender identity (which occurs in about 5 percent of 46,XX CAH). Deferring surgery also permits the patient to make their own informed decision about surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A disadvantage of deferring surgery is that it obviates the parents' right and responsibility to make an informed decision about what they deem is in the child's best interest. Deferring surgery would also require the parents to raise a child with atypical genitalia, which they may not want or be capable of doing. Moreover, in studies examining the timing of genital surgery, most 46,XX females with CAH and their parents preferred surgery in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] or at least before puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Furthermore, difficulties during adolescence were greater for both patients and parents when late genitoplasty was performed. </p><p/><p>There are no controlled studies comparing the effect of early versus late genital surgery on psychosocial or psychosexual development, or quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The decision for surgery and the timing must be made after a complete discussion with the child's parents or caregivers of the potential advantages and disadvantages of early surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>It is useful to structure the conversation around the following goals:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstruction of atypical anatomy to normal anatomy (ie, to normal female anatomy for most individuals with CAH)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preservation of sexual function and erotic sensation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preservation of fertility when possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminution of gonadal malignancy potential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of realistic expectations for the patient, family, and surgeon</p><p/><p>If surgical intervention is deemed necessary at any point in the life of an individual, only the most skilled and experienced of surgeons should perform the necessary reconstructive procedures. Functional outcome usually should take priority over cosmetic outcome, so care should be taken to spare the neurovascular supply of the genitalia. Surgical planning should include clear communication with the family to promote realistic expectations. </p><p>Suggestions about the timing or nature of surgical intervention must be carefully discussed with the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Whether the parents or caregivers choose early or delayed reconstruction, they must be fully informed and actively participate in the decision, and the family and child will need frequent psychosocial and medical support as the child grows to adulthood. Sensitive and age-appropriate sharing of information with the child also is an important part of either management approach. Progressive, benevolent disclosure of information to children within their capacity to understand, enhances their adaptability and their ability to participate in decisions, and is ethically necessary. </p><p>Decisions about surgical management of the gonads, including considerations of malignant potential and fertility, are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Gonads'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1186251878\"><span class=\"h2\">DSDs with predictable gender identity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For several of the most common DSDs associated with atypical genitalia, projected gender identity is reasonably predictable and positive, and management decisions are straightforward (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57610 \">table 1</a>).

About 95 percent of such patients who are raised as girls do not experience gender dysphoria as adults, provided that the disorder is diagnosed in infancy and they are given standard treatment with glucocorticoids (which suppresses endogenous androgen production) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/22-24,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24,33</a>]. The female gender role is also consistent with the individual's internal anatomy, and fertility may be possible. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For individuals who are <strong>not </strong>diagnosed and treated for CAH in infancy (eg, those living in low-resource countries), female gender identity is much less certain. This may be due to exposure to high concentrations of androgens in utero and during childhood, the effect of male sex of rearing in this setting, and possibly to the benefits of higher social position enjoyed by males in some societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Indeed, a literature review suggested that gender dysphoria is uncommon among highly virilized 46,XX patients who are reared as males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Because of these observations, it has been suggested that a male sex of rearing be considered in 46,XX patients with Prader V external genitalia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This approach remains controversial in the United States and Europe; important considerations include age of diagnosis and social setting in which the family lives.

For those with moderate or severe virilization (Prader III through IV) and female sex assignment, the standard surgical correction is to bring the normal vagina to the perineum, repair the fistula between the vagina and common urogenital channel, and locate the urethra within its normal position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Advances in understanding the neurological innervation of the vagina and clitoris have influenced surgical technique, permitting preservation of sexual function and sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Modern techniques include partial urogenital sinus mobilization to bring the vagina to the perineum; when necessary, the vaginal tissue is supplemented with a posterior skin flap, and the anterior vagina is supplemented with excess common urogenital sinus tissue. Function is prioritized over cosmesis, which often means advocating to families and patients that it is acceptable to have a clitoris that is larger than average. If clitoral surgery is necessary in patients assigned a female sex of rearing and with more severe forms of virilization (Prader III through V), the reduction is performed through a ventral approach to preserve sensation and sexual function. However, no long-term data are available on the functional capacity of the clitoris after surgery, including in those patients who received the newer nerve-sparing procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some groups have advocated avoiding all &quot;cosmetic&quot; genital surgery until the child is old enough to make an informed decision, as discussed above.

These individuals have impaired androgen synthesis but are capable of responding to androgens and can virilize during endogenous puberty or with androgen treatment.

This approach was used because they appeared phenotypically closer to females and feminizing surgery was considered less complicated than surgical reconstruction of male anatomy. Case series and other studies suggest that female gender of rearing in these children is often problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>], perhaps as a result of male typical fetal androgen exposure and virilization at puberty (in those with intact testes) and that gender identity evolves from female to male in many, especially around puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgical considerations</strong> &ndash; Once the diagnosis of either of these types of DSD is confirmed, we initiate androgens to stimulate penile growth before proceeding to surgical reconstruction of the hypospadias, which is typically performed between 6 and 15 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypospadias-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypospadias: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>). In patients with undescended testes, orchiopexy should be performed to allow for testicular self-examination. The risk of testicular cancer appears to be similar to that of patients with cryptorchidism. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the rare patient where the individual has a female gender identity, surgical reconstruction needs to take into account the benefit of gonadectomy to prevent virilization at puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If gender identity is fluid or inconsistent with the sex of rearing, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist can be used to prevent virilization at puberty until gender identity is confirmed and the patient can make an informed decision about surgery and hormonal therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3267494667\"><span class=\"h2\">DSDs with less predictable gender identity and other challenges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For infants with the following disorders, gender identity is unpredictable and management decisions are consequently complex.

Although practice varies, the trend is to raise these children as males when possible. Case series suggest that a significant minority (5 to 15 percent) of children raised in either sex role will experience gender dysphoria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. The response to androgen treatment in patients with PAIS is variable. A consensus statement suggests that decisions about sex of rearing should be based upon response of the phallus to testosterone therapy; and female assignment must be considered for those with no evidence of androgen effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The response of the phallus to androgen stimulation is important to determining the optimal timing for surgery. Orchiopexy should also be performed to facilitate testicular self-examination and ultrasound surveillance because these patients are at increased risk for developing testicular cancer in adulthood (about 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a female sex of rearing is planned, we encourage the family to postpone surgery until the child is old enough to affirm gender identity and make an informed decision about surgery, typically during adolescence.

This is an extremely rare form of DSD, in which both male and female gonadal tissue (testis, ovary, or ovotestis) and male and female internal and external structures coexist. The testes are most often found on the right side and can be inguinal or scrotal. Ovaries are most often found on the left side, and ovotestes can occur on either side. The diagnosis requires surgical biopsy of the gonadal tissue for pathologic confirmation of both ovarian follicular and testicular tubular tissue.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gender identity</strong> &ndash; Data from small case series suggest that patients reared in either sex can be satisfied with their sex assignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>], but that gender dysphoria also may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Overall, there are insufficient data to reliably predict gender outcomes for this group of patients.

Fertility is rare, partly because of the close proximity of the male and female internal genitalia, which makes it difficult to separate ductal structures. The risk for gonadal tumors is low in the dysgenetic testicular tissue and appears to be around 2.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/1,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,64</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a male sex of rearing is assigned, surgery involves the removal of the discordant ovarian tissue and retention of the testicular tissue, as well as masculinizing genitoplasty. Conversely, for those assigned a female sex of rearing, the testicular tissue is removed. There may not be a clear separation of ovarian from testicular tissue in an ovotestis and, consequently, gonadectomy may be necessary to prevent discordant secondary sex characteristics from developing at puberty. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260877467\"><span class=\"h3\">46,XX CAH, Prader V</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, a 46,XX child with CAH will present with essentially normal male external genitalia (complete penile urethra; Prader V).

It is important that the family <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patient understand that this type of surgery is irreversible and precludes female fertility. It is not necessary to remove the vagina, although its presence may increase the risk for urinary tract infection, similar to the risk seen in patients with an enlarged prostatic utricle. The gonadectomy should be done prior to puberty to prevent menstruation and breast development. Alternatively, treatment with a GnRH analog can be initiated prior to puberty and the surgery deferred until later in adolescence or early adulthood, when the patient can affirm his or her gender identity and participate in the decisions about further surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642014267\"><span class=\"h3\">46,XY with severe genital anomalies</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sex of rearing</strong> &ndash; The genital anomalies of 46,XY individuals with cloacal exstrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106090\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106090 \">picture 3</a>), micropenis, or penile agenesis are not associated with disruption of sex hormones.

This strategy is in the best interest of the child, given the cultural constraints of raising a child with atypical genitalia and an undefined gender.</p><p>Children with atypical genitalia who do not undergo early surgical correction provide continued and various management issues for their parents. Once a decision has been made about sex of rearing, the child should be raised in the predicted sex, although the parents should be encouraged to be accepting if the child conveys a different gender identity, either verbally or through behaviors. Parents should be aware of this possibility and reminded of it as the child gets older and has a better understanding of his or her condition. A multidisciplinary team specializing in DSDs can facilitate the child's participation in any decision-making process, as appropriate to the child's age. </p><p>For both the child and parents, long-term follow-up with mental health workers skilled in this area is critical to improve outcome. Counseling should be multistaged and take place at birth, sometime after two years of age, at school entry, before and during pubertal changes, and at least annually during adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Counseling should be detailed and honest. Pubertal development, the likelihood (or not) of menses and fertility, and sexual function should be addressed.</p><p>Psychological gender must be monitored by skilled professionals during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood so that if the patient's gender identity is inconsistent with the sex of rearing, the patient can receive full psychological, medical, and surgical support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical concerns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ongoing medical concerns in children with DSDs include the potential for malignancy in gonadal tissue, the effects of altered levels of sex steroid exposure, and decreased bone mineral density.

Adrenal crisis also may occur in some other types of CAH, including 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency. Therefore, any newborn infant with atypical genitalia and nonpalpable gonads should be presumed to have CAH and monitored for salt-loss and adrenal crisis until the diagnosis is excluded. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk of adrenal crisis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first steps to determine the cause of the DSD are a karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome (SRY), and a pelvic ultrasound.

Standard treatment with glucocorticoids suppresses endogenous androgen production. Management decisions are more complex for the rare 46,XX child with CAH who presents with male external genitalia (complete penile urethra; Prader V), especially if they present after infancy. (See <a href=\"#H1773286451\" class=\"local\">'46,XX CAH'</a> above and <a href=\"#H260877467\" class=\"local\">'46,XX CAH, Prader V'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most individuals with <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XY</span> mosaicism and atypical genitalia (mixed gonadal dysgenesis), we advise a male sex of rearing.

Thus, decisions about gender of rearing and surgery should be individualized. In some of these cases, it is helpful to promote the concept of an evolving gender identity, which recognizes that gender identity may change as the child grows.
