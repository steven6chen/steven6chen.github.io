The total number of transplants performed for PBC in recent years has declined slightly, possibly reflecting benefits of early treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nevertheless, transplantation remains an important option in patients with progressive disease despite medical therapy. In the United States, the average age of patients undergoing transplantation for PBC is in the range of 53 to 55 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review issues related to patient selection for liver transplantation, the timing of transplantation, and transplantation outcomes in patients with PBC. Other issues related to the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of PBC are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trials of ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OPTIMAL TIME FOR TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important issue is to determine the optimal time to perform a liver transplantation. Many groups have developed models that use clinical variables to estimate patient survival. Three types of models have been developed: one based upon initial data on entry into the study; one that uses both initial and follow-up data; and one that is based on response to treatment. The Mayo model (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65783\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65783 \">table 1</a>), which uses data from the initial evaluation, is most widely used, but because of individual patient variation, it does not replace the input of an experienced clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The Mayo model can predict short- and long-term survival using current laboratory and clinical data. This tool can be used to anticipate liver failure, allowing the clinician to refer the patient for transplantation in a timely manner. Although these models are specific to survival in PBC, because the MELD score is used to prioritize patients for transplantation, it is often used to determine when to refer patients for transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to considering the MELD score and Mayo model, we suggest that patients with PBC be referred for transplantation evaluation if one or more of the following is present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The plasma bilirubin concentration is greater than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and is increasing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum albumin concentration is below 2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (28 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> and is decreasing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of decompensation or portal hypertension develop, such as ascites, variceal bleeding, coagulopathy malnutrition, or encephalopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has intractable pruritus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has recurrent, debilitating, nontraumatic bone fractures</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Models based upon initial data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on physical examination, laboratory data, and liver biopsy all have predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/2,4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-7</a>]. Among the factors at entry into the study that have been found to correlate with prognosis are age, the plasma bilirubin and albumin concentrations, hepatomegaly, and the presence of cholestasis, portal fibrosis, or cirrhosis on biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>A model developed at the Mayo Clinic does not require liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Survival could be predicted from the patient's age, plasma bilirubin and albumin concentrations, the prothrombin time, and the presence of edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65783\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65783 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>These models are all based upon data obtained at a fixed time point and do not consider more dynamic data such as changes over time or the response to therapy. Models that incorporate these elements would likely more accurately reflect disease progression in individual patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Models based upon initial and follow-up data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two time-dependent predictive models have been developed that use readily available markers and follow-up data to predict survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These models therefore permit a change in the patient's condition to provide an updated prognosis. One uses the plasma albumin and bilirubin concentrations, the presence of ascites, a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and age as important variables. The second uses the same variables and adds plasma immunoglobulin measurements and the presence of cirrhosis and central cholestasis on biopsy. </p><p>Both models were validated and were more accurate than the time-fixed models in predicting survival, particularly in the short term. They suggest that liver transplantation be undertaken when the estimated six-month survival is less than 80 percent. Six months is used as the cut-off since this is the time when survival after transplantation becomes better than survival without transplantation (assuming that an organ is available for transplantation within six months) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62006 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3349655373\"><span class=\"h2\">Models based on treatment response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prognostic models that incorporate data from patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA) have been developed and may be used to identify high risk patients who may benefit from closer monitoring or second line therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. For example, a risk score to predict transplant-free survival uses clinical and biochemical variables obtained after one year of UDCA therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Another model, the UK-Primary biliary cholangitis risk score for predicting end stage liver disease, contains both baseline variables (ie, albumin and platelet count) and variables after 12 months of UDCA therapy (ie, bilirubin, transaminases and alkaline phosphatase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME AFTER LIVER TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excellent short- and long-term survival have been repeatedly described following transplantation for PBC. An illustrative report that included 400 consecutive patients reported 1-, 5- and 10-year survival rates of 83, 78, and 67 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One-year survival rates of 90 to 95 percent are now common at many medical centers.</p><p>These results are significantly better than the predicted survival in nontransplanted patients derived from the models described above. A survival benefit has been demonstrated as early as three months after transplantation. As an example, one study monitored 161 patients with PBC after liver transplantation and compared the results to a simulated group of patients with the same diagnosis who were managed without transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The three-month survival in this group was significantly higher than the predicted values in nontransplanted patients. The two-year survival was also higher with transplantation (74 versus 31 percent), a benefit that was seen in patients from all pretransplant risk groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62006 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Although all patients with PBC benefit from liver transplantation, those who are chronically ill and malnourished prior to surgery do not do as well as those with less severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The Mayo model (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65783\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65783 \">table 1</a>) can help to identify high-risk patients. Unfortunately, the shortage of donor organs often limits transplantation to patients with advanced disease (and thus higher MELD scores), except for those with a suitable living donor. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Models based upon initial data'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=living-donor-liver-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Living donor liver transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As with transplantation for other liver diseases, a very small proportion of patients with PBC require a second transplantation, less than 2 percent in our experience. While recurrent PBC is not uncommon, in one series of patients with recurrent PBC following liver transplantation, only 5 percent lost their grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most second transplants occur within the first month due to problems such as primary liver nonfunction, hepatic artery thrombosis, chronic rejection, acute rejection, and portal vein thrombosis, problems common to liver transplantation in general. This is an important issue because of the shortage in donor organs. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Rate of recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of transplantation on symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resolution of symptoms related to PBC occurs at variable rates. Pruritus and complications of end-stage liver disease, such as encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome are usually promptly reversed after transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus associated with cholestasis&quot;</a>.) Jaundice and ascites resolve somewhat more slowly, over a period of days to a few months. Splenomegaly usually persists, although the enlarged spleen may decrease slightly in size. Skin xanthomas also resolve within a few weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypercholesterolemia-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypercholesterolemia in primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, it may take 12 to 18 months before improvement is seen in hepatic osteodystrophy, despite vitamin D and calcium supplementation. As a result, bone disease is a possible source of long-term morbidity (due to vertebral compression fractures, pain, opiate dependence, and immobility) despite successful liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of low bone mass in primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fatigue may improve in some patients following liver transplantation. In a study that analyzed 31 patients who received a liver transplantation for PBC, 89 percent of patients had moderate or severe fatigue prior to transplantation. Two years following transplantation, 44 percent reported moderate or severe fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. By contrast, in a study of 351 women and 29 men who underwent liver transplantation and equal numbers of matched controls, fatigue did not improve following transplantation in women and was worse following transplantation in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence of PBC in the transplanted liver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is now generally accepted that PBC can recur following liver transplantation, although there was much initial debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/11,15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Rate of recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A precise estimate of the recurrence rate is uncertain since not all studies have used uniform criteria for defining recurrent PBC, and studies have had variable follow-up. Two of the largest series with the longest follow-up (in which the diagnosis of recurrent PBC was based upon histologic features) probably represent the best available estimates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>]. </p><p>In a report of 421 patients from Pittsburgh, PA, recurrent PBC was observed in 8 percent of patients after five years, and 22 percent after 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Higher rates were described in a series of 400 patients from Birmingham, England, where recurrence was observed in 18 percent at five years and 30 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A later report from the same group involving 485 patients found a recurrence rate of 23 percent during a median follow-up of 79 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Much higher recurrence rates were reported by a group from France and Switzerland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In that study of 90 patients who underwent liver transplantation for PBC and had routine follow-up liver biopsies, recurrence rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 27, 47, and 61 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59096090\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical significance of recurrent disease is still being determined.

Patients underwent protocol biopsies at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years or when clinically indicated (eg, because of abnormal liver blood tests). The use of preventive UDCA was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.91). The rates of recurrence for those who received UDCA were 11, 21, and 40 percent at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, whereas the recurrence rates for those who did not receive UDCA were 32, 53, and 70 percent, respectively.
