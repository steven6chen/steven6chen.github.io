Motivational interviewing is used to enhance intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Motivational interviewing has been found to reduce substance use among individuals with DSM-IV substance abuse or dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Substance abuse and substance dependence in DSM-IV-TR were replaced by one diagnosis, substance use disorder, in DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although the crosswalk between DSM-IV and DSM-5 disorders is imprecise, substance dependence is approximately comparable to substance use disorder, moderate to severe subtype, while substance abuse is similar to the mild subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>This topic describes the theoretical foundation, indications, assessment, practice, efficacy, and administration of motivational interviewing. Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use and other treatments for substance use disorder are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Efficacy, adverse effects, and administration&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial treatment of alcohol use disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-use-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-medical-consequences-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine use disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, medical consequences, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-stimulant-use-disorders-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for stimulant use disorders in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-interventions-for-stimulant-use-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial interventions for stimulant use disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12326091\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with substance use problems and disorders often have mixed feelings and thoughts about their smoking, drug, and alcohol use. While they may perceive some negative consequences of smoking, drinking, or using drugs, they also enjoy positive experiences such as intoxication, disinhibition, socialization, and pleasure. They often remain in a conflicted or ambivalent state about changing unless their perception of these costs and benefits shifts. Understanding and resolving this ambivalence is a central goal of motivational interviewing and is accomplished through elicitation rather than persuasion. </p><p>Motivational interviewing is a counseling approach in which clinicians use a patient-centered stance paired with eliciting techniques to help patients explore and resolve their ambivalences about changing behaviors that are not healthy. It is characterized by a collaborative, autonomy-supporting, and evocative style in which clinicians seek to understand patients&rsquo; perspectives, while directing them toward considering changing one or more behaviors by building awareness of a discrepancy between the patient&rsquo;s current and hoped-for self, avoiding confrontation, and supporting patients&rsquo; optimism about the possibility and methods for change. </p><p>Key processes in motivational interviewing include engagement, focusing, evoking, and planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Clinicians using motivational interviewing build rapport and engage the patient with a warm, non-judgmental attitude. They elicit the patient&rsquo;s ideas and feelings about a range of current behaviors, how these fit with the patient&rsquo;s hopes and values, and whether the patient can imagine better options than the current behaviors. During this process, they focus on particular changes that the patient wants to make and match the agenda to the patient&rsquo;s priorities. The clinician elicits the patient&rsquo;s own reasons and rationale for possible changes, referred to as &ldquo;<strong>change talk</strong>.&rdquo; Once people are resolved on changing, they can often do it on their own. Thus, while not essential, motivational interviewing can include processes of planning for and activating changes. In general, motivational interviewing is focused more on discussing the &ldquo;whether&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; to change than the &ldquo;how.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274815\"><span class=\"h1\">THEORETICAL FOUNDATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1531902\"><span class=\"h2\">Conceptual model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A conceptual model of motivational interviewing has yet to fully emerge, but components can be described. The stance of the clinician conducting motivational interviewing is collaborative, evocative, and autonomy-supporting. Clinicians maintain this stance (known as &ldquo;motivational interviewing spirit&rdquo;) across sessions, demonstrating empathy for the patient while providing enough direction to guide the patient toward considering a change. The developing model suggests that if the clinician practicing motivational interviewing shows motivational interviewing spirit and provides both empathy and direction, patients will show higher engagement, lower resistance, and higher change talk in motivational interviewing sessions, and should have better outcomes. </p><p>Two active components have been proposed as leading to the efficacy of motivational interviewing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relational component that includes empathizing, collaborating, evoking patient talk about their perspectives, and supporting patient autonomy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A technical component that includes evoking and reinforcing change talk. These components may or may not be unique to motivational interviewing. </p><p/><p>A complete model of motivational interviewing would elucidate elements unique to motivational interviewing and elements shared with other psychotherapies, and would demonstrate how the relational, technical, and interpersonal components influence patient changes in beliefs, perspectives, emotions, and actions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12325111\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychological theory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Principles of motivational interviewing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>] are grounded in psychological theory, and in some cases, research evidence. The clinical implementation of these principles is described later in the topic. (See <a href=\"#H10072449\" class=\"local\">'Principles'</a> below.)</p><p>Motivational interviewing facilitates behavior change partly by accepting the patient&rsquo;s current level of readiness for change and refraining from pushing for change that the patient is not ready for. This respectful approach is consistent with the transtheoretical model (TTM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], which outlines how people make deliberate changes, especially eliminating problem behaviors and beginning new, healthier behaviors. In the TTM, behavior change is seen as a process that progresses from low awareness and no intention to change, through high awareness and active efforts to initiate or maintain change. Readiness to change is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-goals-and-components#H2607379025\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Goals and components&quot;, section on 'Readiness to change'</a>.)</p><p>Techniques for developing discrepancy in motivational interviewing are intended to foster a different vision of the self and desired behaviors, consistent with modern emotions theory and self-determination theory (SDT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Motivational interviewing seeks to build internal motivation to change and to elicit the person&rsquo;s propensity for positive growth, which are the central sources of motivation according to SDT. SDT suggests that motivational interviewing focuses on autonomous motivations for behaviors that lead toward desired outcomes, including intrinsic rewards, extrinsic gain, or increased consistency between one&rsquo;s values and identity. </p><p>Resolving ambivalence is usually viewed as a cognitive task done to make a choice. It also has critical emotional elements that should not be overlooked. Motivation can be described as a process of opening up to new experiences while actively creating resources to support change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Evoking a positive emotion such as interest may lead to greater openness. When patients experience interest, wonder, or curiosity, their cognitive focus broadens to consider novel options. Increased flexibility in conceptualizing situations may then facilitate resolution of ambivalence and increase openness to engage in activities that lead toward change. </p><p>When taking action in the new direction, patients may improve certain skills and increase the likelihood of achieving a desired outcome. This increases confidence, sense of accomplishment, self-esteem and positive mood, and creates more resources for the person to use for even more profound changes.</p><p>Rolling with resistance is supported by interpersonal theory, which has shown that a friendly style elicits reciprocal friendly responses, while a hostile style elicits a hostile response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Interpersonal theory also suggests that a dominant interpersonal style pulls for submissive behavior (or sometimes, for reciprocal dominant behavior), while submission pulls for dominant behavior. For many people in a leadership role, it is natural to default to a more dominant style. Warm dominance includes being outgoing, encouraging, praising, and suggesting, while cold dominance includes directing, warning, confronting, or disapproving. </p><p>Studies have found reduced substance use followed verbal commitments to change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Explanations for this relationship have been derived from several theories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-perception theory focuses on the patient noticing their own speech and making their behavior consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implementation intentions theory emphasizes processes underlying making a commitment and taking action on it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social cognitive theory emphasizes both observational learning and experience as informing the development of self-efficacy and success in changing behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1022923\"><span class=\"h2\">Conceptualization of problem substance use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the context of motivational interviewing, whether or not a patient has a substance use disorder (SUD) is less relevant than the patient&rsquo;s perception that they should make some changes in their lives. Clinicians using motivational interviewing in patients with a history of substance dependence may elect to advise against drinking and drug use altogether; but, in a motivational interviewing approach, the patient&rsquo;s perspective on their addictive behaviors is more important than the clinician&rsquo;s perspective.</p><p>Rather than conceptualizing the patient as having an SUD, he or she would be understood as being stuck in unhealthy behaviors, and thus, he or she can become unstuck. Unhealthy behavior patterns are seen as the result of competing motivations to make changes and to remain the same. When the benefits of changing outweigh the costs, and when remaining the same is less desirable than changing, the model suggests that people proceed with changing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274936\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Candidates for motivational interviewing include people across the continuum of substance misuse, from problem drinking or drug use to those with severe alcohol and other substance use disorders. Motivational interviewing has been used for varied age groups, diverse settings (including in the criminal justice system), varied substances, and associated behaviors, with varied goals.</p><p>There are no data indicating that certain subgroups of patients with a substance use disorder (SUD) are more or less likely to benefit from motivational interviewing. A meta-analysis suggested that motivational interviewing may be more effective when clinicians and patients are not matched on the basis of racial, ethnic, or cultural characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>There are no absolute contraindications to motivational interviewing. Patients with cognitive impairments or reduced abilities to think abstractly might have difficulty imagining the potential benefits of change or deciding among potential strategies for change. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274943\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment is informal in motivational interviewing, and includes procedures such as open questions and reflective statements to develop an understanding of the patient&rsquo;s perspective and context.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflective listening &ndash; This technique involves careful listening, followed by hypothesizing what the patient might mean, then feeding back this hypothesis to the patient in the form of a statement. As an example, if a patient says, &ldquo;I have tried to quit using drugs so many times&rdquo;, the clinician using motivational interviewing may hear this, hypothesize that the patient is discouraged, and state, &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been easy to stick to your plans to quit using.&rdquo; The patient can then agree, usually signified by continuing the conversation, or may clarify if the clinician has not understood. In this way, reflective listening is iterative and self-correcting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open versus closed-ended questions &ndash; Open questions are preferred in motivational interviewing because they get the patient talking. A goal in motivational interviewing is to increase patient speech while reducing clinician speech so that the patient&rsquo;s perspective is elicited fully. As an example of an open question, a clinician using motivational interviewing might say, &ldquo;Tell me about your use of alcohol and drugs.&rdquo; A clinician asking a closed question might ask, &ldquo;How many times have you used alcohol or other drugs this week?&rdquo; Open questions generally evoke more responses, and specifically, open questions about the patients&rsquo; own concerns tend to evoke change talk. </p><p/><p>In conducting an initial interview, the clinician using motivational interviewing is seeking to understand the patient&rsquo;s perspective as fully as possible. This means that the clinician using motivational interviewing does not have a specific list of assessment questions or domains in mind at the start of motivational interviewing for substance use disorder (SUD). The clinician may query content areas such as the patient&rsquo;s:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns and reasons for coming to the session.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns about substance use patterns and benefits from the substance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hopes for the future, including whether the patient wants to consider reducing or ceasing substance use. </p><p/><p>Many clinicians using motivational interviewing defer reviewing any formal patient assessments (eg, from other clinicians, from law enforcement authorities) until after the initial session. This allows them to focus on the patient&rsquo;s perspective during the first session rather than that of others. It can be useful to elicit the patient&rsquo;s perspective on what is likely to happen with their spouse, probation officer, boss, or others if they choose one or another behavioral path.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10072937\"><span class=\"h2\">Readiness to change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By remaining focused on the patient&rsquo;s concerns and ideas about change, clinicians can assess the patient&rsquo;s current readiness to change and customize the strategies they use to the patient&rsquo;s stage of readiness. Readiness to change is discussed above and in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H12325111\" class=\"local\">'Psychological theory'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-goals-and-components#H2607379025\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Goals and components&quot;, section on 'Readiness to change'</a>.)</p><p>As an example of tailoring, in response to a patient who states, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to cut back further on smoking, but the withdrawal really gets to me&rdquo;, the clinician might offer, &ldquo;You have mixed feelings about quitting; you&rsquo;ve already made progress towards it, but you know that the actual giving up and the withdrawal you experience are tough.&rdquo; In this way, the clinician captures the ambivalence so common in the contemplation stage of change.</p><p>Patient readiness for change can fluctuate within a single discussion in the same clinical encounter. By maintaining a patient-centered perspective and eliciting patient readiness to change rather than attempting to use pressure to motivate change, the clinician using motivational interviewing can avoid evoking resistance by getting ahead of the patient. The patient then feels understood and respected, and is more willing to engage in a consideration of change. Stages of readiness to change and their assessment are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-goals-and-components#H2607379025\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Goals and components&quot;, section on 'Readiness to change'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1022912\"><span class=\"h2\">Motivation enhancement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Motivational enhancement therapy (MET), a four-session variant of motivational interviewing, includes structured, specific assessment of the patient&rsquo;s substance use (including quantitative assessment of consumption) and personalized risk feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition to structured assessment of consumption, some forms of MET incorporate measures of the harmful effects of a patient&rsquo;s substance use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274950\"><span class=\"h1\">PRACTICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The practice of motivational interviewing has a &ldquo;quiet and eliciting&rdquo; style in which the &ldquo;therapeutic relationship is more like a partnership&hellip; than <span class=\"nowrap\">expert/recipient</span> roles&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The patient has intimate knowledge of her or himself; the clinician using motivational interviewing has skill in managing a constructive conversation about change. The clinician provides direct and indirect support for the patient&rsquo;s autonomy to make choices about alcohol and drug use, which could include continued harmful use, using while reducing harms, or abstinence from using alcohol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drugs. The clinician also supports the patient&rsquo;s ability to take actions to change substance use habits.</p><p>Clinicians using motivational interviewing should be friendly, which elicits a cooperative stance. While motivational interviewing has a directive component, leading the patient to explore and resolve ambivalence and initiate change, this directive process is not interpersonally dominant. The clinician using motivational interviewing remains an ally of the patient rather than of the behavior change. </p><p>The spirit of motivational interviewing is evocative. Clinicians ask questions and reflect the patient&rsquo;s perceptions in such a way that a new understanding or commitment is evoked through the conversation. The clinician elicits the patient&rsquo;s perspective to define which behaviors are relevant to their substance use problems, explores the patient&rsquo;s own concerns about these behaviors, and elicits the patient&rsquo;s intention to change or optimism about change, which are aspects of &ldquo;change talk.&rdquo; Many motivational interviewing practitioners believe that the spirit of motivational interviewing, which reflects a unique collaboration between two experts, may be more important than specific techniques.</p><p>Providing education about addiction concepts or persuasion may provoke resistance or reluctance. Using motivational interviewing, clinicians elicit more information than they provide. The patient does more of the talking, explaining, exploring, and considering. Clinicians using the motivational interviewing approach tend to ask rather than tell, and listen rather than advise. Clinicians using motivational interviewing show curiosity about the patient&rsquo;s use of substances rather than content expertise. </p><p>In general, if the clinician wants to provide information, it is best to first elicit what the patient already knows, then ask permission to add a bit more information, followed by eliciting the patient&rsquo;s reaction to it. If a clinician chooses to provide advice, it is only after asking permission (ie, &ldquo;I have some suggestions for you to consider about this if you&rsquo;d like to hear them&rdquo;).</p><p>In learning about the patient&rsquo;s experiences and perceptions, the clinician may occasionally reframe the patient&rsquo;s perspectives to evoke interest in change. As an example, the clinician may hear a patient stating that he can &ldquo;really hold his liquor&rdquo;, and rather than providing information about tolerance, might reframe the patient&rsquo;s statement in this way: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve noticed you can drink more than others without it affecting you as much. I&rsquo;m wondering if this might actually be a risk for you.&rdquo; Patient: &ldquo;What do you mean, risk?&rdquo; Clinician: &ldquo;It sounds like you may not have the internal sense of when you&rsquo;ve had enough. At the levels you can drink comfortably, there can be some damage to organs and tissues. Those are the risks I mean.&rdquo; </p><p>The clinician using motivational interviewing maintains a deliberate focus on the goal of exploring and resolving ambivalence, whether the patient is choosing between abstinence and continued use, or between continued unhealthy or reduced-harm use.</p><p>Motivational interviewing practice builds upon this collaborative relationship with a basic communication style (known by the acronym OARS) that is used throughout consultation or counseling sessions. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>O</strong>pen questions that encourage further elaboration and consideration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong>ffirmations that foster positive feelings in the consultation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>R</strong>eflections that indicate that the clinician has heard and accurately understood the patient</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>S</strong>ummaries that extend the basic reflections to include a sense of momentum or build interest in changing direction</p><p/><p>These techniques are used to build rapport and gain understanding of a patient&rsquo;s issues, to mend rifts in the treatment relationship, to redirect patients to more useful areas of consideration, and to solidify commitment to change in an established relationship where therapeutic alliance is strongly present. </p><p>The motivational interviewing style prescribes that the clinician-patient relationship is inherently non-hierarchical and centered on the patient&rsquo;s experience. Clinicians using motivational interviewing sometimes introduce this conversation differently, as in the following example. Doctor: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to spend a few minutes talking about your drinking so I can understand you better. Here I don&rsquo;t want to hear about your symptoms or problems like I might if you came in with a cold. Instead, tell me a little bit about your typical day, and how drinking fits in.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10072449\"><span class=\"h2\">Principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Principles of motivational interviewing include expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. The theoretical foundation for these principles is described above. (See <a href=\"#H12325111\" class=\"local\">'Psychological theory'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10072456\"><span class=\"h3\">Express empathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians can build rapport with patients and engage them by seeking to understand their perspective, expressing empathy with their situation, and assessing readiness to change. A clinician using motivational interviewing with a patient with a long history of opioid addiction might say: &ldquo;Your use of both heroin and prescription narcotics have brought you to a really scary place, yet you&rsquo;re here now to consider what to do about it.&rdquo; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10072463\"><span class=\"h3\">Develop discrepancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eliciting the patient&rsquo;s perceptions of how well their current behaviors match up with their hoped-for behaviors can be a means of collaboratively identifying discrepancies between the two. As an example, the clinician might ask (taking care to avoid any sarcasm), &ldquo;Tell me more about how drinking in this pattern fits with your plans to take your education further.&rdquo; These discrepancies can illustrate negative outcomes if the patient&rsquo;s behavior does not change. They help the patient focus on a particular behavior-change target and build motivation to change it. Developing discrepancy can also result from eliciting the patient&rsquo;s perceptions of their current good qualities and how they could be expanded, and the likely positive outcomes if such a change was made. </p><p>A clinician might say, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve been successful at keeping hard drugs out of your life for quite a while now. You&rsquo;re proud of what you&rsquo;ve done there. How does that apply to your cigarette smoking?&rdquo; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10072470\"><span class=\"h3\">Roll with resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rather than arguing for change (ie, confronting the patient&rsquo;s resistance), the clinician should roll with the resistance, letting the patient make the arguments for change. </p><p>As an example, if the patient says: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even the one with a problem. My wife nagged me to come in, but my drinking is not an issue.&rdquo; The clinician not using motivational interviewing might end up in an argument with the patient: &ldquo;So your drinking isn&rsquo;t a problem? But your drinking is far over the limits for healthy consumption. You should not be drinking at this level.&rdquo; </p><p>A clinician using motivational interviewing might alternatively say, &ldquo;It was important for you to soothe your wife by coming in. Still, you&rsquo;re not sure that your drinking is any kind of problem. Tell me a little bit about how drinking fits in your life.&rdquo; Once the patient begins discussing drinking, and potentially the positive effects of drinking, he may naturally present the &ldquo;other side&rdquo;, or the negative effects. </p><p>If the patient does not offer this information, the clinician using motivational interviewing might reflect the patient&rsquo;s comments and then ask about it. &ldquo;So you really enjoy having a drink to relax after a hard work day, and it seems that having four to six beers a night is okay for you. What about the other side? Are there any downsides to your drinking, from your perspective?&rdquo; </p><p>This approach sometimes encourages the patient to discuss conflicting or ambivalent feelings about drinking (or other substance use) but in a neutral manner in which the patient does not feel judged. Using these techniques, clinicians using motivational interviewing evoke the patient&rsquo;s ambivalence about substance use, and the discussion typically provides momentum toward resolution of ambivalence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10072477\"><span class=\"h3\">Support self-efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-efficacy is the belief that one can accomplish a specific behavior. As an example, a patient may have self-efficacy that he or she can avoid drug use while at home, even if he or she is less confident that he or she can avoid using at a friend&rsquo;s house. The clinician should keep in mind that it is the patient&rsquo;s responsibility to decide to change, to make a plan to achieve change, and to implement the plan; the clinician&rsquo;s role is to guide and encourage these processes. A clinician using motivational interviewing may support self-efficacy by reflecting it, then asking a key question, as in this example: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve decided you want to cut back or even eliminate using cocaine. At home, you have gotten rid of all your paraphernalia and are not planning to bring any more drugs there. So the main area that&rsquo;s still a little tempting is when you are visiting a friend and he or she might have some and offer it to you. What do you want to do about that temptation?&rdquo; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274957\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flow of motivational interviewing has been characterized as involving four processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]: engaging, focusing, evoking, and planning. Specific techniques are applied in each process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274965\"><span class=\"h3\">Engaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Engaging with the patient thoughtfully can set the stage for rapid and rewarding progress, while failing to build a relationship built on mutual respect and collaboration can result in frustration for both clinician and patient. Several procedures can contribute constructively to a patient interview, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting the agenda collaboratively for the conversation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing information in a productive manner</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eliciting the patient&rsquo;s strengths</p><p/><p>A vignette compares the engagement process using a motivational interviewing approach with a non-motivational interviewing approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F87241\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87241 \">table 1</a>). In the motivational interview, the clinician uses reflective listening throughout, with open questions and affirmations to keep the conversation positive and meaningful. These techniques place the patient in the position of arguing for change (smoking cessation) and empower her to consider the options that would help her move toward change. The clinician is non-judgmental, curious, and patient-centered. </p><p>The following steps provide a template for using OARS to facilitate the process of engagement, setting the stage for a constructive conversation about change. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are your concerns about your [health issue]? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflect what you hear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affirm the patient&rsquo;s thoughts, actions, or feelings about the issue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell me more. (Open questions)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflect what you hear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Summarize the main points. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274880\"><span class=\"h3\">Focusing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next process is focusing, or developing a single focus to discuss in the current conversation from among the many potential issues on a broad health agenda. Because most patients have multiple life issues, and sometimes several health issues, there are usually many possible topics on which to focus. Helping the patient to focus on one or two specific changes he or she could make is more likely to lead to actual change than developing a laundry list of changes that can be overwhelming. </p><p>Clinicians using motivational interviewing help patients focus on a change they can make, typically on small steps that can succeed quickly, in order to build motivation. Once patients have some success, they are often encouraged and energized to try even bigger changes. </p><p>A vignette compares a motivational interviewing approach to a patient with a non-motivational interviewing approach, illustrating motivational interviewing techniques for engaging the patient in behavioral change after experiencing a myocardial infarction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F87243\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87243 \">table 2</a>). In the motivational interview, the clinician reflects the patient&rsquo;s concerns and elicits his thoughts and feelings about what to focus on in order to get his heart healthy. Rather than the clinician advising which changes to make from among the many options, the patient selects the two behavior targets he is ready to change (drinking and exercise) and enlists the clinician&rsquo;s help and expertise in planning for success.</p><p>The following steps provide a template for using OARS to facilitate the process of focusing:</p><p>Tell me about one part of this [health issue] you are most interested in changing now (Open question, narrowing agenda).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflect what you hear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affirm the person&rsquo;s thoughts, actions, or feelings about the issue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explore values related to the one part (Develop discrepancy between current behavior and values). (See <a href=\"#H10072463\" class=\"local\">'Develop discrepancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflect what you hear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How would things be different once you&rsquo;ve made this change? What would be the best thing about making this change? (Open questions)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Summarize the main points.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274887\"><span class=\"h3\">Evoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The next process is evoking. While motivational interviewing seeks to elicit the patient&rsquo;s perspectives throughout the conversation, here evoking refers to eliciting a specific part of the patient&rsquo;s perspective: the thoughts that move them towards change. Statements of reasons to change, ability to change, need to change, desire to change, steps already taken toward change, and commitment to change are considered &ldquo;Change Talk.&rdquo;</p><p>During the process of evoking, the clinician seeks to understand the patient&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings consistent with healthy change. As an example, the patient says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to quit smoking soon.&rdquo; The clinician replies, &ldquo;What are some of your reasons for wanting to quit? How might you go about it?&rdquo; </p><p>In a vignette (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F87244\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87244 \">table 3</a>), the clinician using motivational interviewing employs scaling rulers and key questions to evoke change talk. Scaling rulers are a technique designed to elicit a numeric value (&ldquo;on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 as the highest&rdquo;) for importance, confidence, or readiness, followed by a question such as, &ldquo;What makes it a 5 and not a 0?&rdquo; A patient cannot answer that follow-up question without providing some level of change talk. Key questions are questions with momentum built in, such as in the template below (ie, &ldquo;Where does this leave you? What&rsquo;s the next step?&rdquo;). When the patient expresses change talk, the clinician should reflect or restate it back to the patient as a way of underlining its importance. These steps can help solidify the patient&rsquo;s motivation to make changes, and prepare him or her for the planning process. </p><p>The following steps provide a template for using OARS to evoke change talk: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell me about why this change would be good for you. (Open question)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflect what you hear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What makes this change important to you? What might happen if you don&rsquo;t make this change? (Open questions)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affirm the patient&rsquo;s motivations, and reflect the patient&rsquo;s vision for the future. (Affirmation and Summary)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where does this leave you? What&rsquo;s the next step? (Open questions)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9274894\"><span class=\"h3\">Planning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The last process in a motivational interviewing conversation (or series of conversations) is planning. While formal change planning may not always be part of motivational interviewing, most motivational interviewing conversations contain at least conceptual aspects, and maybe some practical aspects, of planning to change. Planning includes exploring specific barriers to and facilitators of change, and is essentially a problem solving process in which the patient considers how to make changes, how to deal with challenges, and how to measure success. A vignette (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F87245\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87245 \">table 4</a>) illustrates a motivational interviewing-consistent example of the planning process. </p><p>The clinician begins the planning process with a summary of their conversation to date, which includes a mention of a past success. Helping patients to recall past successes can stoke their fire for change. Instead of evoking &ldquo;reasons&rdquo;, using change talk, the clinician evokes commitment using a 0 to 5 scale to assess the patient&rsquo;s confidence in making the change. Using reflections and short summaries, the clinician supports the patient&rsquo;s autonomy and plan for change, and offers support if needed.</p><p>The following steps provide a template for using OARS to develop a change plan:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the change you want to make?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the important reasons to make this change now?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What&rsquo;s the first step?

No difference in substance use was seen when motivational interviewing was compared with treatment as usual for substance use disorders (SUDs), other active treatments, and receiving substance abuse assessment and feedback. The meta-analysis was limited to trials that reviewed audio or videotapes of treatment sessions to assess fidelity to the motivational interviewing model. Substance use was reported using different measures across trials (eg, drinks per drinking day, number of abstinent days, proportion of participants who were abstinent); outcome data were converted into standardized mean differences for comparison in the meta-analysis. Trials were noted to be of low to moderate quality.</p><p>As an example, a trial of 461 patients with DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence randomly compared a four-week structured motivational interviewing intervention with counseling as usual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Motivational interviewing led to reductions in use compared to counseling as usual that were sustained subsequently over 12 weeks. There was no difference between groups in the percentage of urine samples positive for substances. </p><p>Few trials have been conducted comparing the combination of motivational interviewing and a SUD treatment intervention to the intervention alone, but initial results are promising. A randomized trial of 105 outpatients with DSM-IV cocaine dependence compared detoxification and a motivational interviewing intervention with detoxification alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients who received the motivational interviewing intervention increased their use of behavioral coping strategies and had fewer urine samples positive for cocaine at the start of subsequent treatment.</p><p>Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found motivational interviewing to be effective in treating substance abuse in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and college students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and in smoking cessation (which was excluded from the 2011 meta-analysis above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Additional findings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With training, motivational interviewing can be delivered effectively by physicians, counselors, and other staff; professional role does not appear to affect the efficacy of motivational interviewing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motivational interviewing typically achieves its effects in one to four sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Motivational interviewing is used to enhance intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence. (See <a href=\"#H9274824\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates for motivational interviewing include people across the continuum of substance misuse, from problem drinking or drug use to those with severe substance use disorder. Motivational interviewing has been used for varied age groups, in diverse settings (including primary care, specialty care, and the criminal justice system), and for use of varied substances. (See <a href=\"#H9274936\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The basic communication style in motivational interviewing (known by the acronym OARS) is composed of:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>O</strong>pen questions that encourage further elaboration and consideration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>A</strong>ffirmations that foster positive feelings in the consultation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>R</strong>eflections that indicate that the clinician has heard and accurately understood the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>S</strong>ummaries that extend the basic reflections to include a sense of momentum or build interest in changing direction.
