Lupus is an autoimmune condition, meaning that your body's immune system attacks your own tissues, thinking that they are foreign. This can lead to pain, swelling, and damage to organs such as the kidneys. The cause of lupus is not clear.</p><p>People with lupus often have disease flares, in which symptoms worsen, followed by a period of remission, in which symptoms improve. Lupus is mild in some people and is life-threatening in others. However, treatments are available to reduce symptoms, reverse inflammation, and minimize organ damage.</p><p>This article discusses the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments for lupus in adults. The care of pregnant women with lupus is discussed in a separate article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LUPUS CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact cause of lupus is not known. A person with lupus probably inherits the risk from one or both parents, although symptoms usually don't develop until young adulthood or later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus, SLE) can be caused by inflammation, which can affect the whole or parts of the body. Other lupus symptoms are caused by inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> damage to a particular organ system.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whole body symptoms can include fatigue and weight loss.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organ-related symptoms include skin rash following sun exposure and easy bruising due to decreased numbers of platelets in the blood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Whole body symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with lupus develop fatigue, fever, and weight changes at some point in their illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is the most common symptom of lupus, and sometimes the most debilitating. Almost everyone with lupus experiences fatigue, even when there are no other symptoms.</p><p>Fatigue may be caused by lupus itself or by underlying issues, such as depression, unhealthy habits (smoking, unhealthy diet, drug abuse), stress, anemia, use of certain medications, other health problems, lack of exercise, and, in particular, difficulty sleeping.</p><p>Problems with sleep are usually treated with medicine, and an exercise program can improve energy levels. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Weight changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLE can lead to both weight loss and weight gain. Unintentional weight loss is often due to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The side effects of medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal disease</p><p/><p>Weight gain is usually due to one of two factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salt and water retention associated with kidney disease (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Kidneys'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased appetite associated with the use of glucocorticoids (steroids) or other medications</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with SLE get frequent fevers when their disease flares. Fever is defined as a temperature over 100&deg;F (37.8&deg;C).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific organ symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLE can affect many organs of the body, resulting in a variety of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Joint pain and stiffness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint pain and stiffness occur in almost all people with lupus, and these are often the earliest symptoms. The pain and stiffness tends to move from one part of the body to another and does not usually affect both sides of the body in the same way. Only a few joints are affected at any time (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>). Typical joints include the fingers, wrists, and knees. Joints may be swollen and warm (&quot;arthritis&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two-thirds of people with SLE have skin problems at some time. The most common is a rash, known as the &quot;butterfly rash&quot;; this appears as redness over the cheeks and nose after being in the sun (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79355\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79355 \">picture 1</a>). The rash usually lasts only a few days but often comes back. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some people develop circular patches of raised, scaly skin (called discoid lesions), which have a tendency to scar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56910\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56910 \">picture 2</a>). Hair loss (alopecia) is common, but baldness is not. Many people develop ulcers in the mouth, which are usually painless.</p><p>The &quot;Raynaud phenomenon&quot; is a condition that causes blood vessels in the fingers and toes to narrow in response to cold temperatures, emotional stress, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cigarette smoking. As the blood vessels narrow, less blood flows to the area, causing the fingers or toes to become pale and then blue, purple, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> red (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F117079\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117079 \">picture 3</a>). Raynaud phenomenon is a frequent problem in patients with SLE. However, most people who have Raynaud do not have lupus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raynaud-phenomenon-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Raynaud phenomenon (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3288524487\"><span class=\"h4\">Light sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 60 and 100 percent of people with lupus are sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light. This &quot;photosensitivity&quot; causes the person to develop a rash after exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun or fluorescent lights. Some people are also sensitive to UVA radiation (from sunlight). Glass protects individuals sensitive to UVB (from sunlight or fluorescent light) but only partially protects those sensitive to UVA. Blonde, blue-eyed, fair-skinned people are much more photosensitive than brunettes or people with darker skin.</p><p>If you are sensitive to sunlight, you can do the following to minimize UV exposure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a sunscreen with a sun-protection factor (SPF) of 50 or greater every day, even if you don't plan to spend a lot of time outdoors. The sunscreen should be applied 30 to 60 minutes before going outside and should be reapplied every four to six hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sun exposure during the midday (between 10 AM and 4 PM).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid medications that may cause photosensitivity (your doctor or nurse can talk to you about this if you have questions about your medications).</p><p/><p>More information about sun protection is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunburn-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Sunburn prevention (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Kidneys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in kidney function are common in people with lupus. These changes usually develop during the first few years of the illness. Monitoring for changes in kidney function with urine and blood tests can help to detect these changes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lupus can cause inflammation of the filtering device in the kidneys (the glomerulus); this is called glomerulonephritis or lupus nephritis. Damage to the glomeruli can prevent the kidneys from filtering wastes from the bloodstream. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Glomerular disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initially, the kidneys may &quot;leak&quot; protein from the blood into the urine. When severe, this can cause water retention, swelling in the feet and lower legs, and other changes referred to as the nephrotic syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-nephrotic-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The nephrotic syndrome (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Left untreated, lupus nephritis can lead to permanent scarring in the kidneys. If the kidneys are too damaged to filter the blood properly, you will need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Fortunately, treatments to prevent or minimize lupus-related kidney disease are available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Digestive system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The digestive system can be affected by medications often used to treat lupus, including glucocorticoids and NSAIDs. These medicines can cause upset stomach, or, less commonly, stomach ulcers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting can occur if lupus affects the pancreas (pancreatitis), the lining of the abdomen (peritonitis), or the large intestine (colitis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Lungs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of lung diseases can occur in people with lupus (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with breathing &ndash; Pleurisy is a type of chest pain that gets worse when you take a deep breath. This can occur if there is inflammation of the lining covering the lungs and inside of the chest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath &ndash; Shortness of breath can occur due to several different problems. Collection of fluid in the space around the lungs (called pleural effusion) can interfere with expansion of the lung. Inflammation of the air sacs of the lung (pneumonitis) or dysfunction and scarring of the supporting tissues between the air sacs (interstitial lung disease) can cause difficulty breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of symptoms that can develop if lupus affects the heart or blood vessels:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain with exercise &ndash; As mentioned above, people with lupus can develop chest pain as a result of pleurisy. In addition, lupus can increase the risk of developing coronary artery disease. Symptoms of coronary artery disease can include chest pain with exercise or emotional stress that resolves with rest (angina pectoris). Sudden severe chest pain or pressure that does not go away within a few minutes may be a sign of a heart attack (myocardial infarction).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain due inflammation around the heart &ndash; Chest pain can also occur if lupus causes inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart, a condition known as pericarditis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath due to heart valve disease &ndash; Shortness of breath can be caused by heart as well as lung involvement. The heart valves can become leaky or narrowed as a result of damage to the lining of the heart cavity and surfaces of the normally smooth valves (endocardium).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lupus can affect the nervous system in many ways. These problems may be related to lupus itself, to treatments used for lupus, or to unknown causes. Some of the most common problems affecting the nervous system include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty concentrating and thinking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion or memory loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression and anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning or tingling in the hands or feet (called peripheral neuropathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness or numbness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>There are treatments that can help with lupus-related nervous system problems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropsychiatric-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Eye</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eyes are sometimes affected by lupus. The most common symptom is dryness of the eyes with a feeling of grittiness or a lack of tearing (called keratoconjunctivitis sicca). This can be treated by using over-the-counter &quot;artificial tears&quot; (a liquid, gel, or ointment that can help relieve the symptoms of dry eye).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus, SLE), an experienced doctor will consider your symptoms as well as the results of your laboratory (eg, blood and urine) tests. In addition, professional medical societies have created specific criteria to classify patients with lupus. While these criteria were developed to aid in research, they are sometimes used in medical practice to help with the diagnostic process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is no cure for systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus, SLE), a variety of treatments can reduce symptoms, limit damage to vital organs, and reduce the risk of recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet and nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with lupus do not require a special diet but should instead eat a well-balanced diet. A well-balanced diet is one that is low in fat; high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; and contains a moderate amount of meat, poultry, and fish.</p><p>However, you may need to make changes to your diet, depending upon how lupus has affected your body. If you have questions about your diet, discuss these with your healthcare provider. In general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with active lupus and fever may require more calories.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids (such as prednisone) increase appetite, potentially causing you to gain a lot of weight. Try to control your appetite and to stay active. Weigh yourself daily while taking prednisone, and talk to your healthcare provider if you gain more than five pounds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your cholesterol or triglyceride levels become elevated, you may be advised to eat a special diet to help manage this. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have swelling (edema) in your feet or lower legs, decrease the amount of salt and sodium in your diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Low-sodium diet (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra vitamins are rarely needed if you eat a balanced diet. If you are not able to eat a balanced diet or are dieting to lose weight, you should take a daily multivitamin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you take glucocorticoids every day or are a postmenopausal woman, you should take 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 units of vitamin D per day to minimize bone loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking a moderate amount of alcohol (one drink or less per day for women; two drinks or less per day for men) is usually safe for people with lupus. However, alcohol can interact with medications used to treat lupus. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herbal and other dietary supplements are not recommended and may even cause harm.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Being inactive while ill can cause you to lose muscle and energy quickly. A separate article discusses how to incorporate exercise into your life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Arthritis and exercise (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccines to prevent pneumonia and the flu are recommended for people with lupus. Some people should also get the shingles vaccine.</p><p>In contrast, vaccines that contain live viruses (eg, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, and smallpox) are not recommended for people with lupus, especially if you currently take prednisone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain medications are known to worsen lupus. You should not take these medications if there is an acceptable alternative. Sulfa-containing antibiotics are examples of medicines that some people need to avoid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy and birth control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with lupus are at increased risk of miscarriage; however, the majority of women with lupus who get pregnant are able to carry to term. Miscarriage occurs more often in women with active disease, especially if there has been related organ damage; other issues sometimes associated with lupus, such as the presence of certain proteins in the body (called &quot;antiphospholipid antibodies&quot;), also increase the risk of miscarriage. Your doctors can guide you on how to maximize your chances of having a healthy pregnancy and baby. In most cases, women should wait until their lupus has been under control (ie, no flares) for at least six months before trying to get pregnant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are several options for women with lupus who want long-term birth control. The best choice depends on your symptoms, risk factors, and personal preference. Your gynecologist and rheumatologist can help you find something that works for you. Options may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intrauterine device (IUD) &ndash; An IUD is a small device that is placed in the uterus to prevent pregnancy. While a number of IUDs are available, those that release the hormone progestin are often recommended for women with lupus who want a long-term method of birth control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth control pills &ndash; Most birth control pills contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin. These are safe for many women with mild forms of lupus. However, some women (eg, those at an increased risk of blood clots) probably should not take any medicines that contain estrogen. For these women, the progestin-only birth control pill (sometimes called the &quot;mini pill&quot;) may be a good option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injectable birth control &ndash; The birth control shot (brand name: Depo-Provera) contains progestin and is injected into a muscle (usually the buttock or upper arm). It may be an option for some women with lupus, although it should not be used long-term in women who have osteoporosis or are taking glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives, and targeted therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Certain other birth control methods, including the skin patch, implant, and vaginal ring, are not usually recommended for women with lupus because the amount of estrogen they contain may increase the risk of blood clots.</p><p>Many medications often used to treat lupus can interfere with birth control, making one or both medications less effective. Your doctors can review your current medications with you in order to help you choose a birth control option that will be safe and effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1502622600\"><span class=\"h2\">General treatment concepts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different medications are used in the treatment of lupus, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, glucocorticoids (also called steroids), and immunosuppressive agents.</p><p>The choice of medication therapy for lupus is highly individualized and is typically guided by the specific organs that are affected. However, there are some measures that should be taken in all people with lupus. All people should be treated with hydroxychloroquine (brand name: Plaquenil) or chloroquine unless these medications are otherwise contraindicated. The benefits of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in SLE are broad and include relief of whole-body symptoms (such as fatigue and fever), musculoskeletal symptoms, and skin symptoms, as well as a reduction in the number of flares. People with internal organ lupus (eg, involvement of the kidney, heart, lungs, or central nervous system) usually require glucocorticoids alone or in combination with medications that suppress the immune system (called immunosuppressive medications). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives, and targeted therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Joint pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAIDs can usually relieve joint pain caused by lupus-related arthritis and inflammation. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine may be especially helpful for people with skin symptoms and joint pain that have not fully responded to NSAIDs. These drugs may also help to protect the body from lupus-related organ damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives, and targeted therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids may be used alone or in combination with medications that suppress the immune system. Examples of immunosuppressive medicines include mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine. Examples of B-cell targeted therapies that are sometimes used include rituximab and belimumab. All of these treatments are generally reserved for people with significant organ damage, particularly of the kidneys, blood, lungs, or central nervous system, or for those needing high doses of glucocorticoids to treat their condition.</p><p>The benefit of these medications must be weighed against the risks because these treatments have potentially serious side effects. Glucocorticoids can cause weight gain, worsened diabetes, thinning of bones (osteopenia and osteoporosis), and an increased risk of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Other options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other treatment approaches for lupus have been tried or are under investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW WILL SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AFFECT MY LIFE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus, SLE) can cause a wide spectrum of symptoms; in some people, it is relatively mild while, in others, it is a severe, debilitating illness.</p><p>The survival rate of people with SLE has dramatically increased over the last several decades from approximately 40 percent still alive at five years in the 1950s to survival rates of approximately 90 percent at 10 years. The improvement in survival is probably due to multiple factors, including the ability to recognize the disease earlier with more sensitive diagnostic tests, to begin treatment earlier, and to promptly treat complications.</p><p>Many people go into remission and require no treatment, sometimes even for years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Researchers are continually conducting clinical trials of systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus, SLE) treatments to find better ways of treating the disease. A clinical trial is a carefully controlled way to study the effectiveness of new treatments or new combinations of known therapies.
