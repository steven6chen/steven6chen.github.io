Nervous system toxicity is usually subdivided into acute (during the course of radiation), early delayed (weeks to three months after radiation), and delayed reaction (more than three months).</p><p>Several syndromes of radiation injury to the spinal cord have been described, the most prominent of which are a self-limited transient myelopathy and the more serious chronic progressive myelopathy. Other more disabling manifestations of radiation injury, including acute paralysis secondary to ischemia, hemorrhage within the spinal cord, and a lower motor neuron syndrome, are much less common, with only a few case reports in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The complications that can occur following irradiation of the spinal cord will be reviewed here.

Single doses of up to 100 Gy have been given without acute effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A transient radiation-induced myelopathy may develop two to six months following spinal irradiation. This condition is widely believed to be due to temporary demyelination of the posterior columns of the spinal cord and is not generally a precursor of chronic progressive myelitis.</p><p>The characteristic manifestation of transient radiation myelopathy is the development of Lhermitte symptom, a nonpainful but unpleasant electric shock-like sensation that shoots down the spine during neck flexion. Increased spinal cord metabolic activity and positive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging have been described in association with Lhermitte's sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The incidence of Lhermitte symptom is difficult to estimate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In two large observational series in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal cancer, respectively, Lhermitte symptom developed in 4 and 10 percent at a mean of three months after radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. Some dose-dependence of radiation to the cervical spinal cord was noted; in one of the reports, symptoms lasted an average of six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of Lhermitte symptom in cancer patients includes tumor progression causing spinal cord compression, as well as other treatment complications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> neurotoxicity.

Although rare, chronic progressive myelopathy is an ominous late complication of radiation. Unlike transient myelopathy, it is usually irreversible, and there is no treatment with established benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology and pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two types of pathologic change can occur in patients with radiation myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The first is damage to white matter that ranges from demyelination, through Wallerian degeneration of axons, to frank necrosis. The second change is in blood vessels that can extend from morphologically intact vessels to fibrinoid necrosis and hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The degree of morphologic derangement does not always correlate with clinical severity of the myelopathy. Symptoms usually reflect the size and location of the lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of radiation myelopathy is incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The adult spinal cord contains multipotential stem cells that can differentiate into oligodendroglial cells as well as astrocytes. Both oligodendroglial cells and their precursor cells can be damaged by radiation, leading to loss of myelin function. Radiation also stimulates astrocytes and microglial cells to produce cytokines. One of these cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), increases the permeability of spinal cord blood vessels leading to edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The role that this and other cytokines play in the damage to blood vessels and cellular structures of the spinal cord is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation dose-volume effects and risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The influence of dose and fractionation on the risk of chronic radiation myelopathy can be understood in three contexts: fractionated radiation, hypofractionated, and re-irradiation. Historically, analyses of the impact of dose and fractionation on radiation myelopathy have been inconsistently reported, in part because older treatment planning systems are less reliable in reporting maximum point dose and other parameters along the dose-volume histogram of the spinal cord. The <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> ratio is a radiobiologic parameter for tissues that estimates the influence of dose per fraction on response and toxicity. For the spinal cord, this value is often assumed to be &lt;2 (highly influenced by dose per fraction), but its exact value is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376535480\"><span class=\"h3\">Fractionated radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) study, sponsored by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), analyzed the literature on the risk of chronic radiation myelopathy as a function of the total dose of radiation, the extent of the spinal cord included in the treatment field, and the size of individual treatment fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In this review, using a conventional fractionation schedule (2 Gy per day) and including the entire cross section of the spinal cord, total doses of 50 Gy, 60 Gy, and 69 Gy were associated with risks of chronic myelopathy of 0.2, 6, and 50 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376535486\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypofractionated radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypofractionated radiation employs dose and fractionation schedules with a daily dose of &ge; 4 Gy per day. It is typically used in combination with techniques for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).</p><p>Data on spinal cord tolerance in this setting are complicated by the need to convert various dose and fractionation schedules to a normalized dose. One common method is to use the linear quadratic (LQ) model to calculate the <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;nBED2/2,&quot;</span> which is the 2 Gy equivalent biologic effective dose assuming an <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> ratio of 2. Of note, the reliability of the LQ model in settings of high dose per fraction is controversial. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The QUANTEC study determined that with SBRT to a partial section of the spinal cord, the risk of radiation myelopathy with a single fraction of 13 Gy or 20 Gy divided into three fractions was less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multi-institutional experience used nine cases of radiation-induced myelopathy after spine SBRT to build a logistic regression model that estimated risk of radiation myelopathy based on point maximum volume (Pmax) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Using this model, there was a &le; 5 percent risk of myelopathy when limiting the thecal sac Pmax volume to 12.4 Gy x 1, 17 Gy in two fractions, 20.3 Gy in three fractions, 23 Gy in four fractions, and 25.3 Gy in five fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Recommendations were made to limit maximum point doses to the thecal sac of 10 Gy in a single fraction or <span class=\"nowrap\">nBED2/2<sub></span> </sub>of 30 to 35 Gy for up to five fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Practice patterns from an international research consortium reported spinal cord limits that varied from 10 to 11 Gy x 1, 15 to 18 Gy in three fractions, and 20 to 23.75 Gy in five fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In most centers, these doses were applied to a 1 to 1.5 mm expansion around the spinal cord.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376535492\"><span class=\"h3\">Re-irradiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of spinal re-irradiation is growing as patients with spinal metastases are living longer and experiencing failures after conventional radiation therapy. In all cases of re-irradiation, caution and conservatism must be used in patient selection, target delineation, and choice of cord tolerance. Preclinical data suggest that there is substantial recovery in primate spinal cord tolerance over time, to 76, 85, and 101 percent of the initial dose at one, two, and three years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>The QUANTEC study reviewed 13 single-center series, all of which reported a median interval of &ge; 6 months between radiation courses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. No cases of myelopathy were observed for cumulative doses of &le; 60 Gy in 2 Gy equivalent doses.</p><p>In the context of spine SBRT, a multicenter study concluded that re-irradiation appeared to be safe when the following guidelines were all met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five or more months elapsed after conventional radiation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Re-irradiation thecal sac Pmax <span class=\"nowrap\">nBED2/2</span> of &le; 20&ndash;25 Gy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total Pmax <span class=\"nowrap\">nBED2/2<sub></span> </sub>&le; 70 Gy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SBRT thecal sac Pmax nBED comprised &le; 50 percent of the total nBED</p><p/><p>A Canadian series reviewed outcomes of re-irradiation after prior spine SBRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Fifty-six spinal segments in 40 patients were previously treated with a first course of a median of 24 Gy in two fractions. At the time of progression, a salvage course of SBRT was provided with a median dose of 30 Gy in four fractions. The one-year local control was 81 percent, and no cases of myelopathy were reported. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376535797\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of radiation myelopathy range from minor sensory or motor deficits to complete paraplegia. Symptom onset is most often insidious. The latency period prior to onset of symptoms is often greater than six months. In one series, the mean latency period was 18.5 months after a first course of radiation and 11.4 months in previously irradiated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The initial signs can be subtle, such as decreased temperature sensation or decreased proprioception. These signs may stabilize or slowly but inexorably progress to lower extremity weakness, foot drop, the Brown-Sequard syndrome, incontinence, hyperreflexia, loss of bowel and bladder function, or complete paresis below the irradiated section of the spinal cord. Rarely, neurologic symptoms remit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Preclinical data also suggest that an immature spinal cord may be at higher risk for radiation myelopathy, and therefore additional caution should be used in very young patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376535843\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other etiologies should be excluded prior to diagnosing chronic radiation myelopathy. The most common cause of myelopathy in cancer patients is disease progression or development of new metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The differential diagnosis also includes neurotoxicity caused by chemotherapy, trauma, B12 deficiency, paraneoplastic syndromes, and demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of radiation myelopathy is usually made clinically and supported by spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Factors that can help clarify the role of radiation-induced damage include the dose of radiation to the spinal cord and the latency period between radiation and the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radiation-induced myelopathy is typically characterized by intramedullary T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity spanning the affected segments. Focal contrast enhancement after gadolinium may be present. Limited data suggest that apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) may add additional sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Much later there may be only atrophy without evident signal abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. When radiotherapy records are unavailable, the radiation port can often be discerned by the hyperintense appearance of the irradiated vertebral bodies on T1-weighted images.</p><p>Spinal fluid examination is usually not helpful with only an increase in the protein concentration. Evoked potentials may show a spinal conduction velocity block. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the severity of chronic progressive radiation myelopathy, a variety of treatment approaches have been suggested. However, none are supported by robust clinical data.</p><p>Initiation of high-dose glucocorticoids is the most common first treatment for radiation myelopathy. Symptomatically, some patients will respond at least partially to a trial of glucocorticoids. Care should be taken to use the lowest effective dose and to taper steroids in patients who do not respond clinically. Steroid myopathy related to chronic steroid use is of particular concern, as it may worsen preexisting deficits related to the myelopathy itself.</p><p>Other strategies have been extensively studied in preclinical settings but have little clinical data to support their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The strongest supporting evidence is for anti-angiogenic agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF A). In a small placebo-controlled randomized trial for central nervous system radiation necrosis (not specifically limited to spinal cord), bevacizumab led to both radiographic and neurologic improvements in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

A study of 11 patients suggested that anticoagulation with heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>&nbsp;could play a role in recovery of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>There is no clinically-proven strategy to prevent the onset of radiation myelopathy. Growth factors (eg, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin like growth factor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor) appear to prevent or delay radiation myelopathy in preclinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In animal models, both magnesium and vitamin E ameliorate lipid peroxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], a biochemical abnormality believed to be related to radiation damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER LATE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed injury to the spinal cord typically is manifested by a chronic, progressive myelopathy.

The disorder follows radiation therapy by 3 to 25 years, after which patients develop slowly progressive weakness of lower extremities with little or no sensory loss and normal, or almost normal, bladder and bowel function. The MRI shows gadolinium enhancement of the roots of the cauda equina. Pathologic changes suggest a vasculopathy of proximal spinal roots with preservation of lower motor neurons within the spinal cord.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Radiation dose-volume effects and risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lower motor neuron syndrome is a disorder that follows radiation therapy by 3 to 25 years. Patients slowly develop progressive weakness of lower extremities with little or no sensory loss and normal, or almost normal, bladder and bowel function. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Lower motor neuron syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage to spinal cord blood vessels can lead to telangiectasia and even cavernous malformations, which can result in an acute hemorrhage.
