Characteristic features of PSP include vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and postural instability with unexplained falls. This topic will review the management and prognosis of PSP. Other aspects of PSP are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple system atrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corticobasal-degeneration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Corticobasal degeneration&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-system-atrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple system atrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease#H130394006\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2796785422\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no treatments that alter the natural history of disease in PSP and no drugs that provide significant symptomatic benefits as seen with levodopa in idiopathic Parkinson disease. However, several nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic supportive measures are available for the treatment of PSP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1901630588\"><span class=\"h2\">Multidisciplinary interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multidisciplinary approach is essential, involving healthcare professionals from neurology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, nutrition, neuropsychology, psychiatry, social work, and palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietitians as well as speech and language therapists can help to manage dysphagia and dysarthria. Specific modalities for dysarthria include facial exercises, written communication, and a talking keyboard. Some experts advise routine swallowing evaluations (eg, every six months) to assess the risk for dysphagia and aspiration, which are major causes of mortality in patients with PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Treatments for dysphagia include head posturing, dietary changes, and percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement in more advanced cases. However, a gastrostomy tube does not diminish the risk of aspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early occupational therapy is essential in promoting longer independence in performing activities of daily living. Mirror-prism lenses can allow patients with severe limitation of extraocular movements to read and feed themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Eyelid crutches, alone or in combination with botulinum toxin therapy, may be useful for eyelid opening apraxia and blepharospasm, which can be severe enough to render a patient with PSP functionally blind [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Decreased blink rate can be effectively treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>, in addition to dark glasses to reduce photophobia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy and aerobic exercise can provide symptomatic treatment for postural instability and falls, such as gait and balance training, in addition to advice on walking aides, such as weighted walkers and low-heel nonstick shoes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The combination of frontal-lobe disturbance and postural instability results in significant difficulty in the management of patients with PSP, exposing them to even higher risks of falling. Freezing of gait can be improved by the use of walkers with lasers, visual cues, rhythmic cues, and arc turns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care needs may be present from the time of diagnosis. Advance care planning should be addressed as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], ideally while the patient retains decision-making capacity, to express their wishes on the goals of care, future treatments such as artificial feeding, intensive care unit interventions, resuscitation status, the place of care, the place of death (eg, home, hospice, or hospital), their will, and funeral plans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-approach-to-parkinson-disease-and-parkinsonian-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative approach to Parkinson disease and parkinsonian disorders&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1590659788\"><span class=\"h2\">Support groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expert nursing support and lay associations are invaluable for providing helpful information to caregivers and their families. Local, regional, and national associations can play an integral role to benefit lives of patients, family members, and caregivers. These groups include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foundation for PSP | CBD and Related Brain Diseases <a href=\"http://www.psp.org/&amp;token=Z6pSLDzk9TLOJCgK6ZmcAcQKvjAnmf1T/56Qd6Jm19k=&amp;TOPIC_ID=113998\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CurePSP</a> &ndash; North America</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.pspeur.org/&amp;token=Z6pSLDzk9TLOJCgK6ZmcAdJqGt8jWjkbLOkiAARLN6I=&amp;TOPIC_ID=113998\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The PSP Association</a> &ndash; Europe</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119726134\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurotransmitter replacement strategies have <strong>not</strong> had a major therapeutic impact in PSP. </p><p>The main role of levodopa in patients with suspected PSP is diagnostic; a poor or unsustained response to levodopa therapy is generally observed in patients with PSP and can help to distinguish PSP from idiopathic Parkinson disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1623805722\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Supportive features'</a>.)</p><p>However, levodopa therapy may provide some degree of transient benefit, as suggested by several small retrospective reports. One study found that 4 of 12 patients with postmortem-confirmed PSP showed a &quot;modest improvement&quot; while receiving levodopa with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The improvement was not sustained and resulted in adverse effects in more than half of the patients. In a later report of 15 cases of autopsy-confirmed PSP, 9 showed some benefit to levodopa used in combination with other drugs, and 5 had some improvement on levodopa alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the benefit was generally minimal and was observed only in the early stages of the disease.</p><p>Therefore, a trial of levodopa is suggested for symptomatic treatment of patients with PSP who have disabling or troublesome parkinsonism to determine responsiveness. Although regimens vary, many experts suggest treating with levodopa 1000 mg to 1200 mg per day (up to 300 mg per dose) if tolerated for at least one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The variant PSP with predominant parkinsonism (PSP-P) is often initially responsive, whereas the classic PSP with Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) is generally not responsive to levodopa.</p><p>A common side effect of levodopa in patients with PSP is visual hallucinations, although there have also been reports of dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>], oromandibular dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and apraxia of eyelid opening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>There is only limited data for a variety of other drugs that have been used for symptomatic treatment of PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1,6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Botulinum toxin injections can effectively treat various forms of focal dystonia and drooling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amantadine</a> can provide a transient therapeutic benefit for gait and dysphagia in a minority of cases and can also help drooling and dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13-15</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Zolpidem</a> administration was associated with improved motor function in 2 of 10 patients compared with placebo or levodopa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a> has been assessed in a few patients with variable results for improvement of motor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,18</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1150028781\"><span class=\"h2\">Other interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electroconvulsive therapy, while helpful in some patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease, has been used in a small number of patients with PSP with mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Early anecdotal reports suggested negative results in patients with PSP who had neurosurgical treatments including pallidotomy and subthalamic or pallidal deep brain stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In a case report, deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the pedunculopontine nucleus was associated with modest benefit in a patient with PSP-parkinsonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, there was no benefit of DBS in a subsequent trial of eight patients with PSP with Richardson syndrome who received unilateral pedunculopontine nucleus DBS and were randomly assigned to blinded evaluation in both the off-stimulation and on-stimulation states at 6 and 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H825632993\"><span class=\"h2\">Investigational therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research into potential disease modifying therapies for PSP has focused on agents with tau-active properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. One approach involves agents such as tideglusib, which inhibits a key enzyme (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) that plays a role in the hyperphosphorylation of tau [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Another approach involves the neuroprotective agent davunetide, which is thought to maintain microtubule function, reduce tau phosphorylation, and inhibit apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Unfortunately, randomized placebo-controlled trials of tideglusib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] or davunetide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] for patients with PSP found no benefit. Nevertheless, treatments targeting tau aggregation, tau phosphorylation, and microtubule stabilization are still considered to be viable approaches for disease modification trials in PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in the pathophysiology of PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a preliminary six-week placebo-controlled trial of 21 patients with PSP, coenzyme Q10 improved brain energy metabolism via magnetic resonance spectroscopy and improved the PSP rating scale and the Frontal Assessment Battery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, a subsequent one-year placebo-controlled trial of 61 subjects with PSP failed to demonstrate any disease-modifying effect of high-dose coenzyme Q10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3721230731\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease progression in PSP usually occurs fairly rapidly and relentlessly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Early onset of dysphagia, which is seen in both the PSP-RS and PSP-P phenotypes, was also predictive of shorter survival. The prognostic effect of the presence of a supranuclear gaze palsy was inconsistent across studies. Levodopa response, as often seen in the early stages of the PSP-P phenotype, did not predict longer survival.
