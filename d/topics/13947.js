POUR following pelvic surgery in women is typically caused by bladder (detrusor) dysfunction, urethral obstruction, or failure of pelvic floor relaxation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F98686\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98686 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59945507\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal bladder function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A description of normal bladder physiology can be found in the following illustration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65433 \">figure 1</a>).

Preoperative urinary retention (postvoid residual &gt;150 mL) is a risk factor for failed voiding trials after pelvic floor surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An exception to this observation is repair of advanced pelvic organ prolapse (POP) where restoration of normal pelvic anatomy improves the passage of urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Women with preoperative voiding dysfunction are counseled about the increased risk of POUR and may be taught clean intermittent catheterization prior to surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59945533\"><span class=\"h3\">Anesthetic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conduction anesthesia (epidural, spinal, and combined <span class=\"nowrap\">spinal/epidural)</span> blocks the sensory and motor nerve impulses of the sacral spinal cord, which suppresses the micturition reflex, decreases detrusor contractions, and increases bladder capacity. A spinal injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> results in seven to eight hours of neural blockade. The bladder will start to regain function once the spinal block regresses to S2 or S3 sacral segments, although a full return to normal function occurs 1 to 3.5 hours after the ability to ambulate returns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. The addition of opioids to epidural anesthetics increases the risk of POUR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>A 2009 meta-analysis involving more than 18,000 patients reported higher rates of POUR with conduction blockade as compared with general anesthesia (23 versus 17 percent) in a general surgery population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Peripheral nerve blocks were associated with a lower incidence of POUR (&lt;5 percent) due to the agent&rsquo;s confinement to the region of injection and the short half-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59945607\"><span class=\"h3\">Nerve injury secondary to surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower urinary tract dysfunction resulting from surgical nerve injury varies with the type of procedure.

The main nerves at risk are the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves in the pelvic and hypogastric plexus, respectively. </p><p>Compared with radical hysterectomy, hysterectomy for benign disease has a lower risk of POUR because nerve injury is less likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The incidence of POUR is similar for total versus supracervical hysterectomy and for open versus laparoscopic approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59947009\"><span class=\"h3\">Cystotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystotomy is a common complication of gynecologic surgery which can mimic voiding dysfunction (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Identification and management&quot;</a>). Women with cystotomy can have a variable presentation: The patient may be unable to void, void only small volumes, or void successfully with enough urine to &ldquo;pass&rdquo; a simple voiding trial. A woman with an unrecognized cystotomy may lack voiding sensation, suprapubic pain, or an elevated postvoid residual (PVR). The woman may complain of abdominal fullness, and physical exam may detect a fluid wave, fluid leakage across the incision site, or blood-tinged urine. Late findings include signs of peritoneal inflammation, ileus, genitourinary fistula, and sepsis.</p><p>Cystotomy can mimic voiding dysfunction because the perforation can act as a one-way valve that allows bladder filling. Upon voiding, the detrusor contraction forces the urine into the lower pressure peritoneal space rather than down the urethra, and the patient may have a very weak or absent urinary stream. Hysterectomy for benign disease is associated with cystotomy rates of 0.9 to 2.9 percent, depending on the route of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Bladder perforation at the time of retropubic sling surgery occurs in 2 to 5 percent of procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. </p><p>Cystotomy can be differentiated from urinary retention by irrigating the bladder with 75 mL to 100 mL of sterile saline through a bladder catheter and then attempting to withdraw the same amount of fluid. In a patient with a cystotomy, the volume withdrawn will be much lower than the volume instilled. The diagnosis can also be made by retrograde cystography or cystoscopy. Cystoscopy is often performed at the time of hysterectomy, incontinence surgery, and POP surgery to detect cystotomy, identify intravesical placement of sutures or mesh, and confirm ureteral patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59945655\"><span class=\"h3\">Bladder overdistention injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute prolonged bladder overdistention is defined as &ge;120 percent of a normal bladder capacity for &ge;24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Unlike chronic bladder distension, which often evolves slowly, bladder wall ischemia can occur as early as 30 minutes during acute overdistention. Ischemia can be followed by reperfusion injury, processes that contribute to the prolonged bladder dysfunction following acute overdistention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59945701\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative agents used for analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative epidural analgesia (continuous infusion or patient-controlled) is associated with a higher rate of POUR than systemic analgesia via pump, intravenous or intramuscular routes (14.7 percent versus 3.1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Obstruction caused by an incontinence sling may result in an even slower urinary stream, incomplete bladder emptying, and elevated PVR, which may persist for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/21,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26-29</a>]. Surgical lysis of sling may be required for treatment (see <a href=\"#H59943311\" class=\"local\">'Women with persistent postoperative voiding dysfunction'</a> below). We do not perform urethral dilation following synthetic sling placement because of concerns that it may increase the risk of urethral mesh erosion and lack of data supporting efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of POUR and subsequent treatment vary with the type of incontinence procedure.

Over time, foreign material in the urethra obstructs urine flow and can result in stone formation, recurrent urinary tract infection, and elevated PVR. A urethral perforation or foreign body requires surgical reconstruction of the urethra and removal of the causative agent.

Besides the mass effect, rectal distention by stool may result in a recto-vesicourethral reflex: Rectal distention causes decreased bladder pressure and increased urethral tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59946264\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure of pelvic floor relaxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure to relax the striated muscles of the urethra and pelvic floor during normal voiding results in dysfunctional voiding and POUR, which can worsen after pelvic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These women typically use abdominal straining (Valsalva maneuver) to overcome the urethral outlet resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The diagnosis is made with urodynamic testing. In 76 women with urethral obstruction confirmed by video-urodynamics, nearly half of the women had a functional obstruction of an otherwise normal urethra (failure of pelvic floor relaxation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2215795\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms associated with POUR include a slow urine stream, straining to void, a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, suprapubic pressure or pain, need to immediately re-void, and position-dependent micturition.</p><p>We typically perform a retrograde voiding trial in patients with symptoms or risk factors for POUR. POUR is diagnosed by an elevated postvoid residual volume (PVR) (more than 100 mL) with bladder catheterization or ultrasound (see <a href=\"#H59943901\" class=\"local\">'Retrograde voiding trial'</a> below). The clinician may palpate the bladder on exam. However, bimanual exam only has a sensitivity of 14 percent for detecting a bladder volume of greater than 50 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The diagnosis rarely requires urodynamic testing. </p><p>In general, voiding symptoms, with the exception of slow urine stream, have poor sensitivity and specificity for predicting an elevated PVR in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. In fact, women with an elevated PVR may void often due to their diminished bladder capacity and resulting urinary frequency. Obstructive voiding symptoms are also poorly correlated to urodynamic evidence of obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59943855\"><span class=\"h1\">VOIDING TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Voiding trials, either retrograde or spontaneous, are performed to confirm adequate voiding and minimal postvoid residual (PVR).

In addition, retrograde voiding trials were preferred by patients, had a greater ease of use in the outpatient setting, required fewer catheterizations, and took less time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59943901\"><span class=\"h2\">Retrograde voiding trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a retrograde trial the bladder is retrograde filled through the catheter with 300 mL of sterile saline or until the patient says she is at maximum capacity (whichever occurs first). The bladder catheter is removed and the patient asked to void. A void of 200 mL or greater is considered successful (two-thirds of instilled volume).

The patient is instructed to wait to void until she has a strong urge to void or four hours have passed. She is then prompted to void into a measuring collection device (hat). The voided volume is measured and the PVR is obtained by a straight catheterization or ultrasound within 15 minutes of the completed void. </p><p>Success is typically defined as a PVR of 100 mL or less, or the ability to void two-thirds or greater of the total bladder volume (total bladder volume = voided volume + PVR). Patients are typically given two voiding trials in succession and they have to pass the second trial to go home without catheterization.</p><p>There is no standardized PVR for spontaneous voiding trials.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59946878\"><span class=\"h4\">Frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are instructed to record both their voided volumes and postvoid residual volumes (PVRs); this combined volume should not exceed the functional bladder capacity, or 400 to 600 mL, whichever is smaller. This often requires four to five catheterizations daily and varies based on fluid intake patterns and volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Women who do not have normal bladder sensation may need to catheterize themselves at least once overnight to avoid an overdistention injury. Catheterization continues until PVRs are consistently less than one-third of the voided volume and total bladder volumes are not causing overdistention. If there is a concern that CIC cannot be performed four to six times a day, then an indwelling catheter should be placed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59946898\"><span class=\"h4\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of bladder drainage through CIC or an indwelling catheter is based on clinical experience and the specific etiology. Women who cannot sense their bladder filling and who have undergone a radical pelvic procedure will often require bladder drainage for up to six months before an assessment can be made about the permanence of the dysfunction. In this case, CIC is a preferred modality for bladder emptying since sensory and motor function can be assessed over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59943311\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with persistent postoperative voiding dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with persistent voiding dysfunction undergo a repeat examination. Office examination includes assessment of the pelvic floor tone and muscles to confirm appropriate pelvic floor relaxation, which is essential for efficient voiding and defecation. Women with significant pain or discomfort during examination may benefit by pelvic floor physical therapy that emphasizes pelvic floor muscle elongation and relaxation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314462684\"><span class=\"h3\">Examination of pelvic muscle tone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the pelvic exam includes assessment of muscle tone and pain in both passive and contracted states, in the dorsal lithotomy position.</p><p>For the passive exam, we explain to the patient and set her expectations by saying: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;I am going to examine the muscles of your pelvic floor. You will feel pressure just like when I press on your thigh.&rdquo; While saying this, press firmly on the patient&rsquo;s anterior thigh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;I can press firmly and you feel pressure but not pain. However, if you had a cramp in your leg, that amount of pressure would be painful because the contracted muscle cannot extend.&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;I will do the pelvic exam and push on the pelvic muscles in the same way.&rdquo; Place one or two digits of your right hand approximately 8 cm into the vagina. Then press firmly on the muscles of the patient&rsquo;s right pelvic floor starting with the muscle attachment to the pubic bone at 12 o&rsquo;clock and rotate to the coccyx. Firm pressure should be applied. Assess for <span class=\"nowrap\">excessive/imbalanced</span> muscle tone and pain at each pressure point. The examination is then performed on the left side of the pelvis. </p><p/><p>If the examination above is not painful, then the exam is repeated while the patient contracts her pelvic floor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To instruct the patient to contract her pelvic floor, we place our left hand lateral to the patient&rsquo;s right knee, and ask her to abduct her knee into the palm of our left hand. This maneuver mimics the pelvic floor contraction that occurs when the patient stands. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exam above is repeated. </p><p/><p>Patients who have asymmetric muscle tone or frank pain are referred for pelvic floor muscle therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314462691\"><span class=\"h3\">Examination for prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the above exam, digital vaginal exam for prolapse is performed with the patient in the <strong>standing</strong> position. Anterior or apical prolapse can cause bladder neck or urethral obstruction and resultant urinary retention. If prolapse is found on exam, a pessary can be used to reduce the prolapse and resolve the voiding dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314462698\"><span class=\"h3\">Incision of midurethral sling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of prolapse, persistent voiding dysfunction may be due to urethral obstruction from an over-tight incontinence sling. Urethral obstruction caused by an incontinence sling is treated with midline incision of the sling. This may be done in the office with local anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The patient is prepped and draped and the sling is identified either by palpation of the anterior vaginal wall or by using a female urethral sound. A midline transvaginal incision is made over the sling and, with the aid of a right angle clamp, the sling is isolated from the surrounding tissue. The sling, which is often folded, is completely transected across the midline and the incision is closed. In our experience, the amount of release created with complete transection of the sling is minimal, on the order of 1 or 2 mm. Success rates following the procedure vary from 86 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. </p><p>The optimal time to perform the sling transection is unclear, but some advocate for earlier intervention to limit potential detrusor muscle damage and to make sling identification easier (ie, before tissue ingrowth and scarring) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In our practice we perform a synthetic sling lysis one to three weeks postoperatively and fascial sling lysis one to two months following initial surgery due to differences in spontaneous resolution. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314462705\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of urodynamic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If no obstruction is noted on exam or the patient&rsquo;s symptoms are inconsistent with the medical and surgical history, postoperative urodynamics may be used to answer specific questions regarding the bladder contractility, urethral tone, and urethral obstruction. If a woman is completely unable to void, a pressure-flow study is often helpful. Urodynamic testing allows identification of women who have occult urethral obstruction; these women maintain a normal PVR because their detrusor contraction is strong enough to overcome the increased urethral resistance created by the sling. Urodynamic testing that specifically measures the urethral pressure profile will be able to identify urethral obstruction and locate the position of the obstruction in the urethra. Pressure-flow studies measure the maximal bladder pressure and the maximal flow rate once a patient has had her bladder filled to capacity. One common nomogram defines obstruction in women as a maximum flow rate of &le;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> with a simultaneous detrusor pressure &gt;20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Urodynamic testing is less helpful for the vague symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">urgency/frequency</span> without signs of retention. It is also not indicated for most women who have detrusor acontractility or hypocontractility following radical pelvic surgery, as nerve injury is typically the cause. In these patients, the use of urodynamics does not change the treatment plan, which is CIC until the patient can adequately void or enough time has passed that full recovery is unlikely (&gt;6 to 8 months). In the settings of radical hysterectomy and pelvic exenteration, the symptoms may never resolve. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59947223\"><span class=\"h2\">Women who present with new onset voiding dysfunction remote from surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women can develop dysfunctional voiding or urinary retention months to years after the initial surgery due to urethral erosion or pelvic organ prolapse (POP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. These patients may complain of pelvic pressure, pain, or overt prolapse. However, their symptoms may also be vague and non-specific.</p><p>Women who initially void normally and then develop voiding symptoms months or years after surgery must be examined for POP, mesh erosion if applicable, and occult urethral obstruction. Physical exam evaluates organ prolapse, urethrocystoscopy diagnoses urethral perforation or foreign body, and multichannel urodynamic testing diagnoses occult obstruction. Urethral erosion can occur after insertion of an incontinence sling. Management of these complications is discussed elsewhere.

Women at risk for voiding dysfunction undergo a retrograde voiding trial prior to discharge to identify overdistention. (See <a href=\"#H59945361\" class=\"local\">'Risk Factors'</a> above.) </p><p>Women who have had an overdistention injury are treated with an indwelling catheter or clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) to avoid further injury. Women who are performing CIC are at risk of a repeated bladder distention if they are not diligent about catheterization frequency, which is typically required four to six times a day and possibly once overnight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. If the CIC frequency is inadequate, then an indwelling catheter is the treatment of choice to avoid further overdistention. </p><p>The duration of bladder drainage through CIC or an indwelling catheter is based on clinical experience and the specific etiology. Women who cannot sense bladder filling and who have undergone a radical pelvic procedure will often require bladder drainage for up to six months before an assessment can be made about the permanence of the dysfunction.

Over time, the patient may develop new symptoms of urinary urgency, with or without incontinence. If the obstruction remains unrecognized, women can develop irreversible bladder dysfunction. The diagnosis is made by measuring the peak detrusor pressure associated with the maximal urinary flow during multichannel urodynamic testing. An elevated urethral pressure profile can also suggest the diagnosis. Ultrasound measurement of bladder wall thickness to diagnose bladder wall hypertrophy has not been standardized and has mixed results in predicting detrusor overactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-83</a>].</p><p>A retrospective analysis of 15 patients who underwent urethrolysis for a fascial sling obstruction assessed patient response to removal of the obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. The women who remained symptomatic after urethrolysis had a longer delay from the initial surgery to urethrolysis compared with women who symptoms resolved (31 months versus 9 months). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147487204\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Urethral obstruction (such as with suburethral incontinence slings) or urethral perforation require surgical intervention. Dilation of the urethra following a synthetic sling placement has been associated with mesh erosions into the urethra and is not recommended. (See <a href=\"#H59945735\" class=\"local\">'Urethral obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms associated with POUR include a slow urine stream, straining to void, a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, pelvic pressure or pain, need to immediately re-void, and position-dependent micturition. The clinician may palpate the bladder on exam. The diagnosis rarely requires urodynamic testing. (See <a href=\"#H2215795\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic evaluation includes examining the patient, treating reversible causes of dysfunction, and ruling out delayed complications. Patients may require bladder drainage with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) or an indwelling catheter to prevent overdistention injury. Urodynamic testing is not typically used to evaluate patients in the immediate postoperative period but may be helpful in patients who present months from surgery.
