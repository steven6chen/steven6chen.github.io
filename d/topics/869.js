This situation is simplistically identified by the finding of a low corrected absolute reticulocyte count (reticulocytopenia). Thus, if a normal corrected absolute reticulocyte count is 25,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">75,000/microL</span> (1.0 &plusmn; 0.5 percent of the five million red <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> a corrected absolute reticulocyte count below <span class=\"nowrap\">25,000/microL</span> indicates poor red cell production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H38\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Reticulocyte count'</a>.)</p><p>There are, however, several important caveats to the interpretation of the reticulocyte count:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reticulocyte count of <span class=\"nowrap\">27,000/microL</span> (ie, at the lower limit of normal) in an anemic patient does not mean that production is normal for that patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppose a patient is losing blood due to hemolysis or blood loss at a rate five times normal and the reticulocyte increase is only three times normal. In this setting, impaired production is contributing to the anemia even though the corrected absolute reticulocyte count is three times normal.</p><p/><p>This topic reviews the major causes of hypoproliferative anemia associated with a low reticulocyte count and a normal or increased MCV (ie, normocytic or macrocytic hypoproliferative anemias). Iron deficiency anemia, a hypoproliferative anemia usually associated with a low MCV (microcytic hypoproliferative anemia), is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The causes and evaluation of a hypoproliferative anemia accompanied by leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (ie, pancytopenia) is also discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-pancytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained pancytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA WITH MODERATELY REDUCED RETICULOCYTE COUNT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peripheral smear in this setting demonstrates normal RBC morphology. The red cell indices are normal or slightly hypochromic or microcytic. The corrected reticulocyte count is decreased to levels below normal, but is usually <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;10,000/microL</span>. The white blood cell (WBC) count is usually normal although there may be a neutrophilic leukocytosis. The WBC are not dysplastic and blasts are not seen. The platelet count is usually normal or elevated. The platelets are not dysplastic.</p><p>The bone marrow is usually not examined in these cases. If studied, it would show normal cellularity, normal maturation of the several cell lines, and normal iron stores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This pattern can be induced by a number of disorders, each of which is discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anemia of (chronic) inflammation</strong> &ndash; This condition is most often associated with infection, inflammation, or malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild to moderate iron deficiency</strong> &ndash; Mild to moderate iron deficiency can be associated with anemia without the classic findings of hypochromia, microcytosis, or low serum ferritin levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unexplained anemia in older adults</strong> &ndash; Approximately 10 percent of older adults are anemic; of these, approximately 30 to 40 percent have unexplained anemia. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-the-older-adult#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in the older adult&quot;, section on 'Unexplained anemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal failure</strong> &ndash; The anemia associated with renal failure is usually due to a marked reduction in erythropoietin (EPO) production relative to the degree of anemia. The EPO level usually does not fall until the creatinine clearance drops below 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other factors also may contribute in selected patients with renal disease. These include a component of the anemia of chronic inflammation if inflammation is present, a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia when vasculitis is present, or autoimmune hemolysis when a disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus affects the kidney. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyporesponse to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endocrine disorders</strong> &ndash; A mild hypoproliferative anemia can be seen in a number of endocrine disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, panhypopituitarism, and primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-in-adults-due-to-decreased-red-blood-cell-production/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. How the anemia occurs in these disorders is not well understood, but correction of the endocrine disturbance usually corrects the anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA WITH VERY LOW TO ABSENT RETICULOCYTES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation in this setting is similar to the above variant with one important exception: the RBC morphology is normal but the reticulocyte count is very low, usually <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;10,000/microL,</span> frequently as low as <span class=\"nowrap\">2000/microL,</span> and occasionally zero.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This pattern is highly suggestive of pure red cell aplasia. The bone marrow will show normal overall cellularity and morphology except for the virtual absence or marked reduction of all identifiable erythroid precursors. Giant proerythroblasts may be seen in those patients with pure red cell aplasia secondary to infection with parvovirus.</p><p>There are many causes of acquired pure red cell aplasia in adults, the most common being idiopathic, drug-induced, myelodysplastic syndrome, T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia, thymoma, and the rheumatologic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Regardless of the etiology, the final common pathway seems to be an immunologic attack, either mediated by T cells or antibodies to erythropoietin, on erythroid progenitors at a maturity level between CFU-E (colony-forming units-erythroid) and proerythroblasts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-pure-red-cell-aplasia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired pure red cell aplasia in the adult&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pure-red-cell-aplasia-due-to-anti-erythropoietin-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pure red cell aplasia due to anti-erythropoietin antibodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematologic-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H2597433726\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematologic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Pure red cell aplasia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MACROCYTIC NONMEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peripheral smear in this disorder shows RBCs that are distinctly macrocytic with very few macroovalocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74901\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74901 \">picture 1</a>). The mean cell volume (MCV) is generally greater than 100 fL, but the value depends upon which automated counter is used and how it was standardized. The white blood cell (WBC) count may be slightly low but there is no dysplasia or blasts. Few, if any, five to six lobed neutrophils are present. The platelet count may be normal or as low as <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL</span>.</p><p>The bone marrow is usually not examined in this setting but, if performed, cellularity and maturation are normal. Megaloblastosis, characteristic of cobalamin or folate deficiency, is not seen. Careful examination may reveal vacuoles about the nuclei of proerythroblasts.

The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is usually &gt;110 femtoliters (fL). The white blood cell (WBC) count is normal or low, but the neutrophils show hypersegmentation with at least 5 percent of the cells having five or more lobes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70609\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70609 \">picture 3</a>).

Bone marrow examination is usually not necessary. When performed, it shows hypercellularity with megaloblastic erythroid hyperplasia, contrasting with the reticulocytopenia. Thus, erythropoiesis is profoundly ineffective. The iron stain may show the presence of ringed sideroblasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65887\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65887 \">picture 2</a>).

The white blood cell (WBC) count may be high, low, or normal, but there is myeloid immaturity extending back to the myeloblast stage. The platelet count is usually low with abnormal morphology, including giant platelets and even megakaryocyte fragments.</p><p>A leukoerythroblastic picture reflects replacement of the bone marrow by granulomas, cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70576\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70576 \">picture 6</a>), fibrosis, or primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The remaining pluripotent stem cells move to the liver and spleen as they did in fetal life, resulting in extramedullary hematopoiesis. The stromal support system in the liver and spleen is not optimal, as it is in the marrow. As a result, hematopoietic cells are released prematurely or abnormally into the circulation. The reticulocyte count is of limited value in this setting because extramedullary hematopoiesis is associated with both disordered release of reticulocytes into the peripheral blood and disordered maturation of nucleated RBC to reticulocytes in the peripheral circulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having recognized the virtually pathognomonic peripheral smear findings, the differential diagnosis focuses on what is replacing the marrow.
