As one of the more common causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes (along with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries), commotio cordis has received significant media attention because of the increased awareness of sudden cardiac death that occurs during sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, potential mechanisms, treatment, and primary prevention of commotio cordis will be discussed here. Other common causes of sudden cardiac death are discussed in detail separately.

While the exact incidence of commotio cordis remains unknown, mostly due to a lack of systematic reporting of cases, commotio cordis has been reported as the second most common cause of sudden death in athletics (behind hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In the mid-1990s, the National Commotio Cordis Registry was established in the United States as a means of collecting data systematically on cases of commotio cordis.</p><p>Since the National Commotio Cordis Registry was established, data on over 200 confirmed cases of commotio cordis have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. Some notable findings from the registry include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young persons are most commonly affected (mean age of registry cases was 15 years); only 9 percent of reported cases occurred in someone older than 25 years of age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>95 percent of reported cases have been in males.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>75 percent of cases have occurred during athletics (50 percent during competitive sports, 25 percent during recreational sports).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases have been reported in sports with blunt projectiles (eg, baseball, lacrosse, hockey) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more physical body contact (eg, football, hockey).</p><p/><p>While the National Commotio Cordis Registry receives reports of cases primarily from the US, 60 cases from outside the US have been reported to the registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patient demographics and survival between victims in the US and outside the US were similar, though non-US victims were somewhat older (mean 19 versus 15 years of age), and a significantly greater number of non-US cases occurred during soccer (20 percent versus 3 percent of US cases).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16873792\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite its traumatic appearance, sudden death due to commotio cordis appears to be a primary electrical event, with ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurring immediately upon chest wall impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11</a>]. In experimental models, several critical variables appear to influence the likelihood of commotio cordis, including the timing of impact during the cardiac cycle, location of impact, and perhaps the velocity of impact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52268 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing of impact &ndash; The most important variable in the development of VF in cases of commotio cordis appears to be the timing of blunt chest trauma within the cardiac cycle. Only impacts occurring during a 20 to 40 millisecond window on the upslope of the T-wave (early ventricular repolarization) will cause VF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64133\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64133 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of impact &ndash; Only impacts occurring directly over the cardiac silhouette result in VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Velocity of impact &ndash; While there is no defined force of chest trauma which results in commotio cordis, the velocity of the projectile at impact appears to be important. As projectile velocity increases up to 40 miles per hour (mph), the incidence of VF increases to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, at impact velocities greater than 40 mph, the probability of VF decreases, while the frequency of structural damage including myocardial rupture and cardiac contusion increases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hardness of impact object &ndash; Harder objects are more likely to cause VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shape of impact object &ndash; Flat objects have never caused VF in the experimental model, and smaller diameter spheres are more likely to cause VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p>Increased dispersion of ventricular repolarization caused by the blow appears to underlie VF in commotio cordis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The ATP-sensitive potassium channel is likely activated by the chest blow and contributes to the development of VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Conversely, stretch-activated calcium channels and the autonomic nervous system have not been demonstrated to be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4609681\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While commotio cordis has been reported from a large variety of blunt chest blows, the most common scenario leading to commotio cordis occurs in sports in which a hard dense object becomes a projectile, such as a baseball, a lacrosse ball or a hockey puck. Smaller spherical objects are more likely to induce ventricular arrhythmias than larger spheres and non-spherical objects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Commotio cordis is almost never caused by pneumatic objects such as soccer balls and tennis balls. Of the victims who were participating in competitive sports, approximately one-third suffered commotio cordis despite wearing the standard chest protection for that sport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4609695\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of commotio cordis is presumptively made based upon the clinical scenario (ie, blunt chest trauma followed by collapse), available electrocardiographic data demonstrating ventricular fibrillation, and the absence of structural heart damage on imaging studies (ie, echocardiogram, computed tomography of the chest) or autopsy. </p><p>All commotio cordis survivors should undergo an evaluation for structural heart disease, in particular including arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and anomalous coronary arteries, and electrical diseases such as the long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>While blunt chest trauma is required as the trigger for ventricular arrhythmias in victims of commotio cordis, any structural damage to the body from this trauma is confined to the chest wall. This is an important point in distinguishing sudden cardiac death due to commotio cordis from more severe trauma, which may lead to a cardiac contusion or myocardial rupture, both of which are associated with high rates of death. (See <a href=\"#H16873792\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Cardiac injury'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38376924\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES/RESUSCITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commotio cordis appears to be a primary electrical event, with ventricular fibrillation (VF) being the initial documented arrhythmia in most victims. Survival in commotio cordis has historically been poor, with no reported survival in the initial 25 patients in the National Commotio Cordis Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, more recent data show that survival is improving, with Registry data showing survival in up to 58 percent for cases reported between 2006 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These improvements in survival are presumably due to earlier recognition and thus activation of emergency medical services, increased bystander CPR, and earlier defibrillation, often by lay bystanders using an automated external defibrillator. In patients in whom autopsies have been performed, there has been no note of anomalous coronary arteries or premature atherosclerotic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-external-defibrillators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated external defibrillators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following the identification of sudden cardiac arrest, the management of persons with commotio cordis follows the standard basic and advanced life support algorithms. Management should include chest compressions with early defibrillation, as indicated. Incorporation of these basic life support and automated external defibrillator concepts has led to an improvement in survival for not only athletes, but also entire populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric basic life support for health care providers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric advanced life support (PALS)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4609695\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of its reported occurrence in a vast array of situations, there is no universal means available to prevent all commotio cordis. However, due to its association with sports involving hard, dense projectiles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical contact, one means of preventing commotio cordis is to avoid involvement in higher-risk (in relative terms) activities. For participants who choose to continue with activities where commotio cordis is seen more frequently, a combination of safety measures including coaching to avoid chest wall impact and protective equipment may decrease the associated risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. In 2017, the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) approved a mechanical surrogate for the evaluation of chest wall protectors to prevent or reduce the risk of commotio cordis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coaching measures should encourage athletes to turn away from oncoming projectiles (ie, baseballs, lacrosse balls) whenever possible to avoid contact to the chest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Softer and less dense balls should be used whenever possible without changing the nature of the game. As an example, age-appropriate safety baseballs have been shown to decrease the risk of commotio cordis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61105\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61105 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surprising, commercially available chest wall protectors have not been shown to effectively prevent commotio cordis, both in the clinical arena and in laboratory animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/3,20,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20,25,26</a>]. Many of the commotio cordis victims reported to the National Commotio Cordis Registry were wearing protective equipment at the time of their event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A new standard for the evaluation of chest wall protectors to prevent commotio cordis has been adapted by NOCSAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38376959\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO PLAY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commotio cordis is a rare event, likely due to the number of factors that need to be met. The issues with return to play are the question of individual susceptibility to commotio and the avoidance of chest wall impact. In the experimental model, a small number of animals were uniquely susceptible to chest wall impact ventricular fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, there is a case report of an individual who likely had two episodes of commotio cordis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Reduction in the risk of chest wall impact would be prudent for individuals who survive a commotio cordis event.</p><p>Survivors of commotio cordis should undergo a comprehensive cardiac evaluation to exclude structure heart disease. This evaluation should include a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and exercise stress testing. Pharmacologic testing for primary electrical diseases (eg, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome) may also be considered if suggested by other ECG parameters. In 2015 the <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> consensus statement on eligibility and disqualification recommendations for competitive athletes recommended that athletes may resume training and competition following commotio cordis if the evaluation for cardiac pathology is entirely unrevealing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/commotio-cordis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2846435818\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
