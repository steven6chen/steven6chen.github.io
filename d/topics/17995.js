In general, all visceral artery pseudoaneurysms (VAPAs), symptomatic visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs), and many asymptomatic VAAs (those meeting criteria) require treatment to reduce the risk of death associated with rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Endovascular intervention is an excellent approach in the elective setting, particularly for patients who are poor risk surgical candidates. </p><p>The specific treatment of VAAs (open or endovascular) will be reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of VAA is reviewed separately.

If this cannot be accomplished, the aneurysm can be occluded. Either can be accomplished using an open surgical or endovascular approach. The choice for an individual patient needs to take into account the clinical presentation, site of the aneurysm (vascular bed), location within the affected artery (proximal versus distal, main trunk branch vessel), clinical presentation, associated risk factors, and local expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14215968\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular intervention'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14216103\" class=\"local\">'Open surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>For either approach, it is necessary to evaluate the specific anatomy of involved visceral vessel before determining the appropriate treatment. (See <a href=\"#H24066100\" class=\"local\">'Specific aneurysm sites'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14215968\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular intervention'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14216103\" class=\"local\">'Open surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA</span> affecting vessels that supply an end organ with multiple sources of flow (native or collateral), the aneurysm can be ligated surgically or embolized percutaneously.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA</span> affecting vessels that supply an end organ that does not have multiple sources of flow (native or collateral), blood flow to the organ will need to be preserved either through the aneurysm lumen using a graft or stent graft, or surgical revascularization (eg, bypass). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24066068\"><span class=\"h2\">Open versus endovascular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although all VAAs and VAPAs can technically be managed using endovascular techniques, open surgical repair and reconstruction may remain the optimal strategy for some <span class=\"nowrap\">VAAs/VAPAs,</span> particularly among those who are hemodynamically unstable and require emergency repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Compared with endovascular interventions, open surgery has the advantage of durability, reduced need for follow-up studies, and mortality rates as low as 0.5 percent in elective repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. Patients with emergency indications and those with significant comorbidities are at increased risk for complications and poor outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the emergency setting, open exploration, control of hemorrhage, and ligation of the aneurysm without vascular reconstruction is expeditious and may be preferred. Endovascular treatment may be an option for selected hemodynamically-stable patients, particularly poor-risk surgical candidates due to comorbidities, in the setting of a hostile abdomen, or when the aneurysm is not easily accessible. However, the overall outcomes using an endovascular approach in the emergency setting have been less desired, in spite of various case reports that may suggest the contrary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In some series, endovascular treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA</span> has been associated with morbidity rates up to 25 percent, related mainly to transient postembolization syndrome, and incomplete aneurysm exclusion, which remains at risk for rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the Mayo Clinic case series of minimally invasive management, all the deaths that occurred were among those undergoing emergency repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This poor outcome was confirmed in another large series that reported a perioperative (30-day) mortality of 8.3 percent, in which all deaths occurred in patients requiring urgent or emergency intervention. There were no mortalities on those undergoing elective intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>The endovascular approach has a more prominent role in the elective setting, for which reported morbidity and mortality rates in the short term are low. With ongoing refinements in catheters, techniques (eg, access, embolization techniques), and devices (eg, stent grafts, multilayer fluid modulating stents), the endovascular approach is evolving to become the preferred initial treatment approach for anatomically-suited <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA</span>. The main advantages of the endovascular approach are its reduced invasiveness, less postoperative pain, decreased wound complications, decreased length of hospital stay, quicker return to normal activities, and improved quality of life in the short term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/3,4,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,15,16</a>]. However, further studies are needed to determine the longer-term durability of endovascular treatment. Cost effectiveness related to endovascular devices may also have a bearing on the approach to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The following illustrate overall outcomes of VAA management using open and endovascular approaches.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large retrospective case series of 185 aneurysms (64 percent VAPA and 36 percent VAA, 46 percent performed for bleeding as an indication) reported a 98 percent technical success rate using an endovascular approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Overall periprocedural (30-day) and aneurysm-related mortality rates were 6.2 and 3.4 percent, respectively. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another large series reported a 98 percent success rate with endovascular intervention using mainly coil embolization for aneurysm exclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The periprocedural (30-day) mortality rate was 8.3 percent, with no mortality for patients undergoing elective intervention. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a comparison series of 94 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA,</span> a 100 percent technical success was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Morbidity and mortality with the open approach were 9.4 and 1.3 percent, respectively. The endovascular group had similar morbidity (10 percent) and no mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14215968\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOVASCULAR INTERVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for endovascular intervention include embolization to occlude the vessel, or endovascular stenting or stent-grafting, which preserves flow through the aneurysm. These endovascular interventions are accomplished using catheter-based technologies that access the common femoral artery in the groin, or the brachial artery. A brachial artery approach may provide easier access if the visceral vessel has a marked downward trajectory.</p><p>Prior to endovascular intervention, anatomic suitability must be determined to evaluate the collateral flow, which determines the approach, adequacy of potential seal zones for stent-grafting, the potential for kinking of the artery, and the accessibility of proximal vessels for placement of the delivery sheath.</p><p>Once the vessel is accessed with a sheath, a guiding catheter aids in cannulating the specific visceral vessel for the introduction of the small catheter that is used to deliver embolizing agents (eg, coils, hemostatic particles, glue, thrombin, polyvinyl alcohol), vascular occluding plug(s), or a vascular stent (multilayer fluid modulating, stent-graft) to exclude the aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>].</p><p>For aneurysms (saccular or fusiform) affecting vessels that supply an end organ with multiple sources of flow or good collateral flow, percutaneous embolization with coils or glue (N-butyl cyanoacrylate) is particularly appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. True visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) with good end organ circulation can be treated with coil packing; however, large saccular aneurysms may have poor long-term outcomes with coil embolization, as the coils may dislodge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> migrate. When using an endovascular approach to treat visceral artery pseudoaneurysm (VAPA), in general, proximal and distal coil embolization should be used. </p><p>For aneurysms affecting vessels that supply an end organ that does not have good collateral flow, blood flow through the aneurysm lumen needs to be preserved. For the specific anatomic site, the risk of stent thrombosis or restenosis resulting in occlusion and potential end organ ischemia needs to be taken into consideration. Either a stent-graft or multilayer fluid modulating (bare) stent can be used. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For stent or stent-graft deployment, the vessel needs to be of sufficient length to attain proper fixation, which should be at least 5 mm of normal artery proximally and distally. Excessive vessel tortuosity also may not permit stent-graft deployment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alternative is a multilayer fluid modulating (bare) stent, which has a spatial three-dimensional design that slows and laminates blood flow inside an aneurysm, allowing an organized thrombus to form. The aneurysm sac naturally thromboses because the flow velocity is reduced (up to 90 percent within saccular aneurysms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Several studies have documented the feasibility and outcomes using multilayer stents in VAA at different sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/9,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19,20</a>]. In one small series, 14 of 16 aneurysms were patent with sac thrombosis at one-month follow-up and no changes at six-months follow-up. However, there were two stent occlusions within two weeks.</p><p/><p>Reported complications of endovascular therapy include access-related problems such as groin hematomas, pseudoaneurysms, and arterial thrombosis, which can occur during any percutaneous intervention. Procedure-specific complications include distal thromboembolism, nontarget vessel embolization, coil migration, end organ infarction, and intraprocedural aneurysm rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Stent thrombosis and occlusion are concerns; however, no consensus exists regarding the use of antithrombotic or antiplatelet agents. Other downsides include higher reintervention rates, incomplete exclusion, unknown long-term durability, and need for repeated imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14216103\"><span class=\"h1\">OPEN SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional open surgical management involves an abdominal incision and mobilization of the organs to expose and <span class=\"nowrap\">ligate/excise</span> the aneurysm, with or without vascular reconstruction depending on the status of collaterals, and when indicated, with end organ resection (eg, splenectomy, bowel resection). Minimally-invasive open surgical approaches use small incisions to gain abdominal access for a laparoscope and other instruments for laparoscopic or robotic-assisted aneurysm clipping. The ease of open surgical access to the aneurysm depends upon the location of the aneurysm, previous surgeries, and the acuteness of the presentation. Open surgical repair in a hostile anatomic environment (eg, in the setting of pancreatitis, sepsis, or multiple previous surgeries) can be technically challenging and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24066100\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC ANEURYSM SITES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to treatment of splenic, hepatic, and mesenteric artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms are reviewed briefly below. Aneurysms involving the pancreaticoduodenal, gastroduodenal, and inferior mesenteric arteries are approached using similar principles. Endovascular coil embolization is particularly useful in these settings, for which open operative exposure may be difficult and arterial reconstruction is not necessarily required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24066108\"><span class=\"h2\">Splenic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment options for splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) include open surgical repair, percutaneous intervention with either embolization coils or covered stents, and laparoscopic excision or clipping. Among these, percutaneous intervention of SAA has become increasingly popular due to its high technical success rates and low morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/2,14,15,18,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,15,18,22</a>]. </p><p>SAAs are often ideal for coil embolization because of the collateral supply from the short gastric arteries. Reported success rates range from 90 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/14,15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,22</a>]. For proximal and midvessel SAA, stent-grafts can be used to maintain perfusion in the main artery; however, tortuosity of the artery can complicate stent-graft placement and deployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Selective splenic artery catheterization and coil embolization of the aneurysm sac are generally recommended for high-risk patients with aneurysm rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>As with endovascular treatment, the location of the aneurysm, as well as its presentation, generally dictates the type of open procedure that is performed. Resection with end-end repair can be performed in many cases, especially with proximal and midvessel SAA, owing to the redundancy and tortuosity of the artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This allows for splenic preservation, which has important implications for the immune system. Splenectomy is performed more commonly in the setting of aneurysm rupture, and may be necessary for aneurysms involving the splenic hilum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/5,8,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,24</a>].</p><p>Complications of SAA coil embolization include splenic infarct and reperfusion of the aneurysm, which occurs in 5 to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. Splenic infarcts are common occurrences in patients with portal hypertension or hilar SAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], but usually are successfully treated with pain control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/10,14,22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,22,26</a>]. In reported series, splenic infarcts occurred in 25 to 40 percent of the patients treated, but no patient required any further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/10,14,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,25</a>]. To evaluate for reperfusion of the aneurysm, annual follow-up with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24066114\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endovascular treatment is emerging as the preferred treatment of hepatic artery aneurysms (HAAs). Open surgical repair for rupture is associated with extremely high rates of morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>For intrahepatic aneurysms, percutaneous embolization is always the first-line treatment owing to the complicated nature of open repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Exclusion of these lesions essentially consists of selective endovascular embolization of the &quot;feeding&quot; arteries proximal to the HAA after the outflow tract has been plugged. Different options can be used, including coils, glue, stents, and detachable silicone balloons, depending on the pathology. With either the open or endovascular intervention, ligation or coil embolization of the hepatic artery can be safely performed if the portal vein is patent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/18,22,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22,27,28</a>].</p><p>Endovascular approaches appear to have particular utility in the treatment of hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms (HAPAs), for which previous abdominal surgery and medical comorbidity are prominent features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/18,22,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22,27</a>]. In unruptured HAPA caused by pancreatitis, percutaneous occlusion is successful in 88 to 100 percent of cases. Good results are also obtained with embolization of ruptured <span class=\"nowrap\">HAA/HAPA,</span> but repeated embolization is necessary in 30 to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a large series, technical success for coil embolization of HAA was 80 percent, and failures were attributed to an inability to cannulate the aneurysm neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Rare reports of hepatic necrosis are probably the result of inadequate catheter placement or embolization, particularly when the portal vein is occluded. In a small series of 12 hepatic artery embolizations, there was no evidence of hepatic ischemia after aneurysm ablation using either coils or glue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Stent-graft repair may be desirable in patients with baseline hepatic insufficiency, or in aneurysms involving the proper hepatic artery to maintain antegrade perfusion. </p><p>Open surgical procedures include ligation, ligation with bypass, partial hepatic resection, and in rare instances, hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/1,11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,22</a>]. Aneurysms involving the proper hepatic artery require vascular<strong> </strong>reconstruction, whereas common HAA may be managed without reconstruction if collateral flow through the gastroduodenal artery is adequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/5,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27-29</a>]. Complications of open surgical repair include graft thrombosis, bile leak, and intraabdominal abscess or sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24066120\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesenteric</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open surgical intervention has been the predominant approach to managing superior mesenteric artery (SMA) aneurysms. For proximal aneurysms, exposure may require a medical visceral rotation, whereas for more distal aneurysms, operative exposure is anterior through the mesentery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Ligation of vessels that enter and exit the aneurysm without reconstruction is feasible in the management of these aneurysms. Collaterals from the celiac and inferior mesenteric arteries are usually sufficient to prevent intestinal ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Prior to ligation, a test occlusion with intraoperative assessment of bowel viability can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Other open surgical approaches include endoaneurysmorrhaphy, or ligation and arterial bypass using a prosthetic graft or with vein in the setting of infection. </p><p>Embolization of the SMA aneurysm sac is particularly suitable for hemodynamically stable patients and is becoming the more popular approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/26,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,31</a>]. In general, literature on these techniques is limited to very small series or case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; thus, long-term outcomes are difficult to assess. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24066126\"><span class=\"h2\">Celiac</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional open repair can be performed through a transabdominal route, and may require medial visceral rotation to access the proximal celiac artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Simple artery ligation can be performed in the absence of liver pathology, but is sometimes accompanied by hepatic ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The indications for treatment depend upon the natural history of aneurysmal disease. (See <a href=\"#H24066062\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-visceral-artery-aneurysm-and-pseudoaneurysm#H1307281181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of visceral artery aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of treatment of VAA and VAPA is ideally to exclude the aneurysm sac from the systemic circulation while preserving distal blood flow; however, if this cannot be accomplished, the aneurysm can be occluded. Either can be accomplished using an open surgical or endovascular approach. (See <a href=\"#H14215707\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA</span> affecting vessels that supply an end organ with multiple sources of flow (native or collateral), the aneurysm can be ligated surgically or embolized percutaneously.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA</span> affecting vessels that supply an end organ that does not have multiple sources of flow (native or collateral), blood flow to the organ will need to be preserved either through the aneurysm lumen using a graft or stent graft, or surgical revascularization (eg, bypass). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ruptured <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA,</span> an open approach is often required for rapid control of hemorrhage. However, the ease of open surgical access to the aneurysm depends upon the location of the aneurysm; some difficult-to-access vessels may be better handled with an endovascular approach (eg, pancreaticoduodenal aneurysm). Ligation of the artery proximal and distal to the aneurysm is often adequate. Perfusion to the end organ should be assessed to determine whether or not revascularization is needed. (See <a href=\"#H24066068\" class=\"local\">'Open versus endovascular'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14216103\" class=\"local\">'Open surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For elective repair of <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA,</span> a percutaneous approach is becoming the first-line treatment for <span class=\"nowrap\">VAAs/VAPAs</span> that are anatomically suitable. The percutaneous approach has high technical success rates, and is associated with decreased lengths of hospital stay. (See <a href=\"#H24066068\" class=\"local\">'Open versus endovascular'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14215968\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular intervention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to specific sites and their outcomes is discussed above for each type of <span class=\"nowrap\">VAA/VAPA</span>.
