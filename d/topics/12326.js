Cardiac mapping during electrophysiologic testing identifies the temporal and spatial distributions of electrical potentials generated by the myocardium during normal and abnormal rhythms. This process allows description of the spread of activation from its initiation to its completion within a region of interest and, in its usual application, is focused toward the identification of the site of origin or a critical site of conduction for an arrhythmia. Multiple techniques for mapping have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19009756\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrogram recordings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recorded electrograms can provide two important pieces of information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The local activation time (ie, the time of activation of myocardium immediately) adjacent to the recording electrode relative to a reference</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The complexity of myocardial activation within the &quot;field of view&quot; of the recording electrode</p><p/><p>Recording electrodes may be either unipolar (one pole in contact with the tissue whose electrical activity is being recorded and the second, an indifferent electrode located on the same catheter far from the first electrode, or independent from the catheter altogether) or bipolar (two poles in contact with the tissue and adjacent to each other separated by a few millimeters). In actuality, both types of recordings are bipolar, except that the two poles are much more widely spaced in unipolar electrodes. Unipolar recordings more accurately represent the timing of local activation but are fraught with the detection of far-field signals due to the wide separation of the two poles. Bipolar signals do not suffer from the problem of recording far-field signals, and that is why they are more widely employed in mapping. Since extracellular potential decreases inversely with the square of the distance from a point source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], far-field events generate relatively low amplitude signals compared with electrogram components generated by near-field sources in unipolar recordings.</p><p>Establishing electrogram criteria, which permits accurate determination of the moment of myocardial activation at the recording electrode, is critical for construction of an area map of the activation sequence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19009762\"><span class=\"h3\">Unipolar recording</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For unipolar recording, the point of maximum amplitude, the zero crossing, the point of maximum slope (maximum first derivative), and the minimum second derivative of the electrogram have been proposed as indicators for underlying myocardial activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Most studies have suggested that local activation is best determined from the unipolar electrogram by the point with maximum slope (maximum change in potential, or <span class=\"nowrap\">dV/dt)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Using this fiducial point, errors in determining the local activation time as compared with intracellular recordings have been typically less than 1 millisecond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19009768\"><span class=\"h3\">Bipolar recording</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Algorithms for detecting local activation time from bipolar electrograms have been more problematic, due in part to generation of the bipolar electrogram by two spatially separated recording poles. Among several options, the absolute maximum electrogram amplitude appears to most consistently correlate with local activation time determined by other means [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19009774\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The necessary equipment for mapping includes special catheters and an appropriate recording device. A large number of multipolar electrode catheters have been developed to facilitate desired catheter positioning and to fulfill various recording requirements. These include, among others, bipolar or quadripolar electrode catheters, multipolar recording electrode catheters, &quot;halo&quot; catheters used for mapping, small caliber electrode catheters, <span class=\"nowrap\">circular/spiral</span> electrode catheters, a &quot;flower&quot; catheter (which has 20 electrodes on five radiating spines in a branching configuration), basket electrodes which can conform to the size and shape of the chamber, and steerable catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. For digital recording systems, the sampling rate should be at least twice as fast as the highest frequency component of the signal in order to avoid aliasing (the Nyquist limit). For practical purposes of activation mapping, however, sampling rates of 1000 Hz are generally adequate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19009780\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocardial mapping techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The simplest form of mapping is achieved by moving the single electrode sequentially to various points of interest on the endocardium in order to measure local activation. The success of roving single point mapping is predicated upon the sequential beat-by-beat stability of the activation sequence being mapped and the ability of the patient to tolerate the sustained arrhythmia. However, this situation may not be present in certain settings such as mapping of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) or a monomorphic VT that has a repetitive sequence of endocardial activation, but is hemodynamically too unstable to allow time for complete roving of the endocavitary catheter in the electrophysiology laboratory. Mapping simultaneously from as many sites as possible greatly enhances the precision, detail, and speed of identifying regions of interest. The more sites that are simultaneously mapped, the less roving of a single point is required. </p><p>Other types of mapping are available for use depending on the clinical situation and type(s) of arrhythmias being investigated. These include activation sequence mapping, pace mapping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68142%7ECARD%2F79938\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef68142 graphicRef79938 \">waveform 5A-B</a>), entrainment mapping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F107237\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef107237 \">waveform 6</a>), voltage mapping, and use of the dominant frequency and fractionated local electrogram. A detailed discussion of these techniques is beyond the scope of this topic but is discussed elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19009786\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations of endocardial mapping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The site of origin of the tachycardia may not be reachable from the endocardial approach. As an example, animal and human studies have shown that approximately one-third of VTs due to ischemic heart disease are generated within midmyocardial, subepicardial, or intraseptal regions; critical sites of VT origin in patients with inferior infarction without aneurysms are more likely to be located in the subepicardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].

VT that cannot be successfully mapped by an endocardial approach, suggesting an epicardial origin, appears to be more common in patients with a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy.</p><p>Epicardial ventricular mapping can be performed with special recording catheters that can be steered in the branches of the coronary sinus. It may be particularly important in identifying right ventricular outflow tract VTs, which may be difficult to ablate with the endocardial approach only. Another epicardial mapping technique using a subxiphoid percutaneous approach for accessing the epicardial surface has been used to map ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19009798\"><span class=\"h2\">Electroanatomical mapping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electroanatomical (or electromagnetic) mapping, which is available in many electrophysiology (EP) laboratories, is based upon the use of a special catheter with a locatable sensor tip, connected to a mapping and navigation system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The system can generate isochrones of electrical activity as color-coded static maps or animated dynamic maps of activation wavefront. These pictures can define reentrant circuits as well as the site of origin or breakthrough of an ectopic activity with centrifugal, monoregional, or asymmetric spread of electrical activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63899%7ECARD%2F54163%7ECARD%2F57238\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63899 graphicRef54163 graphicRef57238 \">image 1A-C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81609\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81609 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>A major advantage of three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping is its ability to allow the catheter to anatomically and accurately &quot;revisit&quot; a critically important recording site, identified previously during the study, even if the tachycardia is no longer present or inducible and map-guided catheter navigation is no longer possible. This accurate repositioning can allow pace mapping from or further application of radiofrequency current to critically important sites that otherwise cannot be performed with a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility.</p><p>The electroanatomical map can be integrated with other imaging modalities. In order to reduce the need for point-by-point reconstruction of the cardiac anatomy, systems have been developed to import and merge a three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) image of the heart obtained pre-procedurally with the electroanatomical map generated during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The location of any conventional mapping catheter with respect to this multielectrode array can be determined by passing a high frequency, low current locator signal by a process described and validated previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The multielectrode array has been deployed in all four cardiac chambers using a transvenous, transseptal, or retrograde transaortic approach in order to map atrial tachyarrhythmias and VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/19,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,34,35</a>]. Systemic anticoagulation is critical to avoid thromboembolic complications. It has been argued that the biggest advantage of noncontact endocardial mapping is its ability to recreate the endocardial activation sequence from simultaneously acquired multiple data points over a few (theoretically one) tachycardia beats, obviating the need for prolonged tachycardia episodes that the patient may tolerate poorly. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic localization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mapping of the arrhythmia prior to performing an ablation is not required for all arrhythmias. Anatomic approaches to ablation are used when the arrhythmia has a known anatomic course. As an example, in typical or common type I atrial flutter, the wave front must proceed through the isthmus of tissue between the tricuspid annulus (TA) and inferior vena cava (IVC). Thus, ablation is directed largely anatomically, with the goal of delivering a continuous series of RF lesions to create an ablation line of complete bidirectional conduction block between the TA and IVC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69946%7ECARD%2F60090\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69946 graphicRef60090 \">waveform 7A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

All of these approaches incorporate an understanding of left atrial anatomy, and some are entirely anatomically based. Ablation for AF focuses on the elimination of triggers for AF via electrical isolation of the pulmonary vein ostia from the body of the left atrium, and sometimes also includes additional lesions made in the body of the left atrium to modify arrhythmic substrate. Advanced imaging techniques (eg, intracardiac echo, electroanatomic mapping, and three-dimensional CT reconstructions) are generally used to facilitate this procedure. The approach to AF ablation is discussed in greater detail separately.

However, DC shock ablation, or fulguration, never achieved widespread use because of a high incidence of complications related to the high energy discharge. The procedure has not been used for many years and is of only historical interest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602059094\"><span class=\"h2\">RF energy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiofrequency (RF) energy, low voltage high frequency electrical energy (30 KHz to 1.5 MHz), is generally delivered from the tip of a catheter to the endocardial surface. RF energy produces controlled focal tissue ablation, as compared with the more extensive damage caused by DC fulguration. Initially, the magnitude and duration of RF ablation were limited by progressive heating of the catheter, leading to the formation of an insulating coagulum of denatured tissue proteins on the catheter tip. In 1995, RF ablation was further refined by the use of saline irrigation to cool the RF catheter tip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This technique prevents tissue coagulum formation and makes larger RF lesions feasible. Saline cooling increased the efficacy of RF ablation in subsequent clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. In selected cases, RF energy may be applied to the epicardial surface via a pericardial approach.</p><p>Since RF energy does not directly stimulate nerves or myocardium, the procedure is usually relatively painless and general anesthesia is not necessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602059100\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryothermal energy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even though RF energy is vastly superior to and safer than DC energy, efforts continue to identify alternate energy sources for catheter ablation.

Cryothermal ablation offers the potential benefit of reversible cold mapping; if mild cooling has the intended effect, more profound freezing can inflict permanent tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>].

Atrioventricular (AV) block may not be immediately observed but may progress following the procedure. However, this is extremely rare in patients who did not have transient AV block during the ablation. The use of cryothermal ablation of the slow pathway is an approach that may reduce the potential for AV block; the ability to test prospective ablation sites before permanent destruction can prevent this inadvertent complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the risks of radiation exposure, clinicians and staff should be vigilant to try and minimize radiation exposure to the patient as well as the staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

This complication can be minimized by post-ablation pacing for three months at a higher rate (ie, 90 beats per minute). A possible mechanism for post-ablation ventricular arrhythmia is activation of the sympathetic nervous system and a prolongation in action potential duration; pacing at a rate of 90 beats per minute decreases sympathetic nervous system activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Troponin I and BNP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of myocardial injury is more accurately assessed by serum troponin levels than CK-MB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].
