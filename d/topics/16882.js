For anesthesia, these devices are used for primary airway management, for rescue ventilation when facemask ventilation is difficult, and as a conduit for endotracheal intubation.</p><p>The SGAs used most commonly in the operating room are the laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) and similar devices, while other SGAs are used more commonly in the emergency department and for prehospital airway management (eg, Combitube, laryngeal tube, pharyngeal tube). The LMA consists of a hollow shaft or tube connected to a mask-like cuff designed to sit in the hypopharynx facing the glottis, with the tip at the esophageal inlet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79779 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103863\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103863 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will discuss the LMA and similar devices as they are used in anesthesia for adults, including placement and ventilation techniques, endotracheal intubation through the LMA, and use in special clinical situations. Unless stated otherwise, in this topic, LMA will be used in a generic sense, referring to a category of airway devices, rather than to a specific manufacturer. Use of SGAs in emergency medicine and in children, and the use of other airway devices in anesthesia are discussed separately.

It is usually easily placed and is less stimulating than endotracheal intubation, but it does not provide complete protection against aspiration and does not prevent laryngospasm. Choice of airway device for anesthesia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871230\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Choice of airway device'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519470992\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of supraglottic airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple types of reusable and disposable LMAs and other supraglottic airways (SGAs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103864\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103864 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103895 \">picture 3</a>). Although the LMA brand is the oldest and best known brand, a number of other companies manufacture SGAs. The original LMA and similar devices are referred to as first-generation SGAs. These basic, first-generation SGAs include an airway tube with a mask-like cuff. Some alternative-brand SGA products duplicate the functionality of the original LMA at low cost (eg, products from Portex [Portex Soft Seal] and Ambu [AuraStraight]), while others are materially different from the original LMA (eg, i-gel, air-Q, Ambu Aura-i, LMA Supreme).</p><p>A number of SGAs contain aperture bars (a grill) over the laryngeal inlet. This feature serves to prevent the epiglottis from entering the shaft of the SGA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107884\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107884 \">picture 4</a>). The epiglottis can interfere with ventilation and with the visualization of glottic structures with a flexible intubating scope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], though the clinical significance of this feature has been disputed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Second-generation devices may include additional features such as bite blocks, cuffs designed to improve the seal, esophageal vents that allow orogastric tube placement, cuff pressure monitors, and in one case, a lumen that allows passage of an upper gastrointestinal endoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103867\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103867 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107856\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107856 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p>Unless cost is an issue, we prefer the more advanced second-generation devices that include bite blocks and esophageal vents. In addition, when the need for high ventilation pressure is anticipated, we prefer a SGA specifically designed for that purpose (eg, LMA ProSeal).</p><p>Some devices, from a variety of manufacturers, incorporate other unique features. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexible, reinforced LMAs have wire-reinforced, flexible airway tubes with a smaller diameter than other LMAs. These features allow them to be positioned away from the surgical field, which is particularly useful for otolaryngologic, dental, and other head and neck procedures in which the surgeon and anesthesiologist are sharing the airway or the surgical field. Examples include the LMA flexible, the Ambu AuraFlex, and the Tru-cuff Ultra Flex EX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103872\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103872 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some LMAs incorporate a preformed curved airway tube in order to facilitate placement. Examples include the Ambu AuraOnce and the LMA Supreme (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107846\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107846 \">picture 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some LMAs include features designed to prevent high-pressure overinflation of the cuff. The Tru-Cuff LM inflation syringe has a built-in pressure indicator. After the LMA is inserted, the cuff is inflated until the indicator is in the green zone on the syringe (40 to 60 mmHg) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103886\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103886 \">picture 9</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another device, the air-Q SP, has a self-inflating, low-pressure cuff (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103892\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103892 \">picture 10</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2024272\" class=\"local\">'Cuff pressure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The i-gel differs from other SGAs in that its gel cuff is not inflatable, yet it provides an excellent seal and eliminates concerns about cuff pressures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107855\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107855 \">picture 11</a>). The i-gel has a gastric vent, an integral bite block, and a flange designed to prevent epiglottic folding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of SGAs have been developed for use as conduits for endotracheal intubation. Examples include the LMA Fastrach and the air-Q intubating laryngeal airway (ILA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63844\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63844 \">picture 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63766\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63766 \">picture 13</a>). The air-Q can be placed as a primary airway device without endotracheal intubation. (See <a href=\"#H519471315\" class=\"local\">'Supraglottic airways as conduits for intubation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In addition to classification of devices based on &quot;generations,&quot; a system has been proposed for the classification and possible scoring of SGAs based on their sealing mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The three groups include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cuffed perilaryngeal sealers (eg, LMAs)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cuffed laryngeal sealers (eg, cuffed oropharyngeal airway [COPA])</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncuffed, anatomically preshaped sealers (eg, i-gel)</p><p/><p>Some SGA products, such as the COPA, the streamlined liner of the pharynx airway (SLIPA), the Cobra perilaryngeal airway (CobraPLA), the Elisha Airway Device, and the Pharyngeal Airway&nbsp;Express, are no longer commercially available or are available only in limited markets.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519470998\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most SGAs come in full sizes (eg, 3, 4, 5, 6), though some are available in half sizes (eg, 3.5, 4.5). While manufacturers' guidelines recommend weight-based size selection, these guidelines generally assume a typical body habitus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103893\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103893 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116402 \">table 2</a>). Predicting optimal sizing is complex as an optimal seal depends on a number of factors, including the size of the device, the cuff inflation, and patient anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>SGA manufacturers provide guidelines for the maximum volume of air to be used for cuff inflation. Suggested cuff volumes are 30 mL for a size-4 LMA and 40 mL for a size-5 LMA. If a high cuff volume is required in order to maintain a seal, we usually replace the LMA with a larger size. A better seal may be obtained using a larger size with less air. Using too small a device and overinflating the cuff may result in a poor fit within the oropharyngeal space and may injure the oropharyngeal mucosa. (See <a href=\"#H2024272\" class=\"local\">'Cuff pressure'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, the size-4 LMA will be suitable for most adult females and the size-5 for adult males up to 100 kg. Ultimately, choice of LMA size is as much an art as a science. In many cases, if the initial size chosen does not provide adequate ventilation (eg, large leak at any cuff volume), a different-size LMA should be tried, or endotracheal intubation should be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519470980\"><span class=\"h2\">Placement technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate depth of anesthesia with intravenous (IV) or inhalational anesthetics is generally established before SGA placement in order to avoid coughing, gagging, laryngospasm, breath holding, or straining. Successful placement in awake patients with adequate topical oropharyngeal anesthesia has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In general, SGA placement is less stimulating than endotracheal intubation.</p><p>Several methods for SGA placement have been described; we generally follow the manufacturer's instructions for placement of the LMA Classic before attempting alternate methods. The technique is summarized as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103894\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103894 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LMA cuff is lubricated with a water-based lubricant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The device is then held with the index finger of the dominant hand placed at the junction between the cuff and the airway tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cuff is pressed upward against the hard palate with the index finger, then backward and downward along the palate in a smooth movement until resistance is encountered. As the index finger is removed, the nondominant hand pushes down on the LMA to prevent dislodgment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cuff is subsequently inflated to a target cuff pressure of around 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, or to the minimum pressure needed to create an adequate seal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>With correct insertion, the LMA sits over the glottis, with the epiglottis lying within the mask aperture. Clinical confirmation of correct positioning is established by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Easy positive pressure ventilation (PPV), requiring low ventilation pressures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate chest rise with each breath</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normal capnogram trace</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No leak with positive pressure breaths under 20 mmHg peak pressure</p><p/><p>With correct positioning, cuff inflation may produce outward movement of the tube, as well as a slight swelling in the neck. However, some malpositions may not be clinically apparent and may not be identified unless a flexible intubating scope is used. Common causes of malposition include a down-folded epiglottis or a flipped-over LMA cuff, which may require reinsertion. (See <a href=\"#H519470986\" class=\"local\">'Troubleshooting'</a> below.)</p><p>Once insertion is complete, cuff pressure can be measured with a manometer designed for this purpose, unless an LMA with a built-in manometer is used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F103163\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103163 \">picture 14</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2024272\" class=\"local\">'Cuff pressure'</a> below.)</p><p>Other SGAs are placed in a similar fashion to the LMA Classic, with the exception of the LMA Supreme, which has a fixation tab that allows placement without inserting the finger into the patient's mouth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519470986\"><span class=\"h2\">Troubleshooting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although SGAs are usually placed successfully, problems with insertion or ventilation occur.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inadequate anesthesia</strong> &ndash; Initial difficulty with placement of a SGA may be due to inadequate anesthesia, such that the patient strains, breath holds, or maintains upper airway tone, preventing seating of the device. Insufficient depth of anesthesia may also cause laryngospasm or bronchospasm, resulting in airway obstruction. If clinically appropriate, ventilation may be improved by administration of additional anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> or inhalation agent) without further manipulation of the SGA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Down-folded epiglottis </strong>&ndash; The tip of the epiglottis can be flipped over as the SGA is placed, resulting in noisy ventilation or airway obstruction. The &quot;up-down maneuver&quot; helps correct this by unfolding the epiglottis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. With this maneuver, the SGA is withdrawn 2 to 4 cm and reinserted without deflating the cuff. Head extension, slight advancement or withdrawal, or SGA removal and replacement may also improve ineffective ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inadequate seal</strong> &ndash; Inappropriate sizing may make a seal difficult or impossible. In general, larger sizes create a better seal with lower cuff inflation volumes and pressures compared with smaller sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The answer to an inadequate seal may be to insert a larger SGA, rather than to add more air to the cuff. (See <a href=\"#H519470998\" class=\"local\">'Choice of size'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient anatomy</strong> &ndash; Placement may be difficult because of anatomical features. If difficulty is experienced with placement, a rotational technique with a partially inflated LMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] or even placement with the aid of fiberoptic laryngoscopy or ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] may be helpful.</p><p/><p>Malpositions can sometimes be managed by repositioning the patient's head, readjusting the SGA position, or adjusting the air in the cuff. When in doubt, we advise reinsertion of the SGA from the beginning or, occasionally, conversion to endotracheal intubation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H697568266\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of mode of ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SGAs can be used with the patient breathing spontaneously or with positive pressure ventilation (PPV). Since the SGA does not seal the pharynx, the pressure that can be safely used to ventilate is limited by leak around the device, with resultant gastric insufflation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoventilation. Therefore, pressure-limited ventilation (ie, pressure support or pressure control) is usually used with a SGA in place, rather than volume-control ventilation.</p><p>Use of LMAs with spontaneous breathing offers a number of advantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids can be titrated according to the patient's respiratory rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroesophageal insufflation of air is rarely a problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air leaks around the SGA are less likely than when using PPV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some malpositions of the SGA are better tolerated.</p><p/><p>On the other hand, PPV with SGA devices offers the following advantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PPV allows control of respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoventilation is avoided during deep levels of anesthesia and when high doses of opiates are administered.</p><p/><p>A number of investigators have explored the use of PPV with SGA devices. Most members of the LMA family, as well as most other SGAs, were designed for use with peak pressures under 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and numerous studies have shown that leak and gastric insufflation are minimal if peak pressures are kept between 15 and 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. The LMA ProSeal was designed for use with higher ventilation pressures (the cuff includes a posterior extension to provide a &quot;double seal&quot;) and ordinarily will allow peak airway pressures up to 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O before leak occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1557748605\"><span class=\"h3\">Pressure-controlled ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) is a mode of PPV commonly used with SGAs. With PCV, the respiratory rate and peak inspiratory pressure are set, along with other parameters. In contrast to volume-controlled ventilation, PCV prevents high peak pressures that can lead to airway gas leaks and gastric insufflation. With an LMA in place, peak pressure is set between 15 and 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, with the rate adjusted to achieve adequate minute ventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1557748611\"><span class=\"h3\">Pressure support ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We routinely use pressure support ventilation (PSV) with SGAs, though not all anesthesia ventilators allow PSV mode. In PSV mode, the patient initiates each breath, and the ventilator delivers additional support with a preset pressure value. A minimum number of breaths is also set. In this mode, the patient controls his or her own respiratory rate and tidal volume, but if the resultant minute ventilation is too low, the minimum rate or the degree of pressure support can be increased.</p><p>In a randomized crossover study comparing PSV with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) using the LMA, PSV at 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) resulted in more effective gas exchange compared with spontaneous ventilation with CPAP at 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692856351\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of neuromuscular blocking agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) can be administered to facilitate SGA placement in order to help prevent gagging, coughing, and laryngospasm, particularly in special circumstances (eg, when thiopental is used for the induction of anesthesia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, NMBAs can be administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation through an LMA.

Standard laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) are too narrow to permit passage of standard-size ETTs.</p><p>Intubating SGAs include features designed to facilitate or improve the success rate of endotracheal intubation. For example, the LMA Fastrach includes a bar that elevates the epiglottis as the ETT passes through the aperture. In addition, a ramp in the Fastrach's intubating tube channel directs the tube centrally and anteriorly in order to minimize the risk of esophageal placement or damage to glottic structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63844\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63844 \">picture 12</a>).</p><p>We prefer to intubate with a flexible intubating scope (FIS) through the SGA, though intubation is possible using a blind technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88283348\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of flexible intubating scope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two methods have been described for intubation through the SGA using an FIS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible scope intubation for anesthesia&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ETT can be loaded onto the FIS, and the entire assembly can be passed through the LMA using visual guidance; this method requires that the ETT pass easily through the LMA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For cases where the desired ETT is too large in diameter to pass through the LMA, a more complex approach is needed, including the use of an Aintree intubation catheter (AIC), which is a modified airway exchange catheter. The AIC is a 56-cm long, flexible, hollow plastic tube with an internal diameter large enough to accept a pediatric FIS. When used to facilitate intubation through a SGA, a 4-mm FIS is placed through an AIC with several centimeters of scope protruding from the end. The composite assembly is then passed through the LMA well into the trachea under visual guidance. The scope is then removed, followed by the LMA, leaving only the AIC. The desired ETT is then passed over the AIC into position in the trachea.

The optimal SGA size for a given patient is one that minimizes leak without excessive cuff inflation. (See <a href=\"#H519470992\" class=\"local\">'Choice of supraglottic airway'</a> above and <a href=\"#H519470998\" class=\"local\">'Choice of size'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The usual method for LMA and other SGA insertion is as follows (see <a href=\"#H519470980\" class=\"local\">'Placement technique'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The LMA cuff is lubricated with a water-based lubricant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The device is then held with the index finger of the dominant hand placed at the junction between the cuff and the airway tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The cuff is pressed upward against the hard palate with the index finger, then backward and downward along the palate in a smooth movement until resistance is encountered. As the index finger is removed, the nondominant hand pushes down on the LMA in order to prevent dislodgment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The cuff is subsequently inflated to a target cuff pressure of around 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O or to the minimum pressure needed to create an adequate seal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SGAs can be used with the patient breathing spontaneously or with positive pressure ventilation (PPV). Pressure-limited ventilation (ie, pressure support or pressure control) is usually used with a SGA in place, rather than volume-control ventilation. Peak pressures should be kept below 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O in order to minimize leak and gastric insufflation. (See <a href=\"#H697568266\" class=\"local\">'Choice of mode of ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A SGA can be used as an airway rescue device when mask ventilation is difficult or impossible. It can also be used as a conduit for endotracheal intubation. (See <a href=\"#H2023874\" class=\"local\">'Supraglottic airways and the difficult airway'</a> above and <a href=\"#H519471315\" class=\"local\">'Supraglottic airways as conduits for intubation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SGAs do not provide complete protection against aspiration of stomach contents. (See <a href=\"#H697568278\" class=\"local\">'Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2024039\" class=\"local\">'Aspiration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of SGAs in obese patients is limited by the potential need for higher peak inspiratory pressures and the possibility of difficult seating of the device. (See <a href=\"#H697568284\" class=\"local\">'Obese patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SGAs can be used for airway management in the prone position, as the primary airway device in selected patients, and as rescue devices. We limit prone SGAs to those patients without risk factors for difficult airway management, without limitations in neck movement, and who will undergo short procedures that do not require paralysis (eg, hemorrhoidectomy, rectal fistulotomy). (See <a href=\"#H519470597\" class=\"local\">'Prone position'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of SGA use include failed placement, aspiration, and airway complications, including airway trauma. Sore throat, dysphonia, and dysphagia may be related to high SGA cuff pressures. The cuff inflation should be limited to approximately 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O or the minimum volume required for an adequate seal.
