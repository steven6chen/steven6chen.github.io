Most newborns in the United States are healthy and do not require additional special assistance, and the need for resuscitation is often not anticipated, even in tertiary birth centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, in the United States, 10 percent of all newborns need some intervention, and 1 percent will require extensive resuscitative measures at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, at every birthing location, personnel who are adequately trained in neonatal resuscitation should be readily available to perform neonatal resuscitation whether or not problems are anticipated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In all instances, at least one health care provider is assigned primary responsibility for the newborn infant. This person should have the necessary skills to evaluate the infant, and, if required, to initiate resuscitation procedures, such as positive pressure ventilation and chest compressions. In addition, either this person or another who is immediately available should have the requisite knowledge and skills to carry out a complete neonatal resuscitation, including endotracheal intubation and administration of medications.</p><p>Equipment needed for resuscitation should be available at every delivery area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69486\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69486 \">table 1</a>), and routinely checked to ensure the equipment is functioning properly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) was developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Heart Association (AHA) as a training program aimed at teaching the principles and skills of neonatal resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The method of choice varies with the availability of a gas supply, the skills of the resuscitator, and the need to deliver positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Self-inflating bag is the most effective method in resource-limited settings, as it does not require a gas supply. T-piece resuscitator is the only device that can provide consistent delivery of both positive inspiratory pressure (PIP) and PEEP.</p><p>In our center, we use all three devices because we have a large diverse group of health care givers, including many trainees.

Unlike the other BMV methods, it does not require a compressed gas source. Thus, it is the only method used when compressed gas sources are <strong>not</strong> available in resource-limited areas. The self-inflating bag has a pressure-release valve, commonly called a pop-off valve that is set by the manufacturer to release at approximately 30 to 40 cm H<sub>2</sub>O pressure. However, for the newborn who has not taken its first breath, it may be necessary to occlude this pop-off valve in order to generate sufficient pressure to effectively inflate a newborn's nonaerated lungs. In such instances, care should be taken not to overinflate the lungs because this may increase the risk of causing pulmonary air leak. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-air-leak-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary air leak in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It has been assumed that the delivered oxygen concentration using a bag without a reservoir is 40 percent when using a source of 100 percent oxygen. However, one study demonstrated that delivered oxygen concentration exceeded 60 percent at a minimum flow rate of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> and rose as the flow rate increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

However, a study in resource-limited settings reported that oxygen concentration can be controlled from &lt;40 to &gt;60 percent without a blender using self-inflating bags with a reservoir by varying the oxygen flow rate from 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> regardless of positive inspiratory pressure (PIP) with PIP levels from 20 to 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow-inflating bag &ndash; The flow-inflating bag (also referred to as an anesthesia bag) fills only when gas from a compressed source flows into it. It is technically more difficult to master than the self-inflating bag because a tight face-mask seal is needed for the bag to inflate; however, this feature may be considered an advantage because it assures that an optimal face-mask seal is obtained necessary for effective PPV.

During neonatal resuscitation, the chest compression rate is 90 per minute accompanied by 30 ventilations per minute with one ventilation interposed after every third compression. Thus, the ventilation rate is reduced from the 40 to 60 breaths per minute in the absence of chest compression to 30 breaths in the presence of chest compression.

Decisions regarding whether intervention should be initiated and to what degree are difficult and are made together by parents and care providers, guided by their understanding of the child's best interests.</p><p>Our approach in deciding whether resuscitation should be initiated or withheld is consistent with the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and includes the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-resuscitation-in-the-delivery-room/abstract/1,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,68</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision not to initiate intensive therapy is made together by the parents and the health care team.
