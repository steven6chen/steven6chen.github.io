The management of diabetes requires consideration not only of glucose values and insulin doses but also of diet and physical activity. In this patient, who was already on an intensive insulin regimen, correction of persistent variability of blood glucose levels required attention to carbohydrate intake and to physical exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Carbohydrate consistency'</a>.)</p><p>While the use of a very-short-acting insulin such as aspart provides flexibility to a patient with a variable intake of carbohydrates, the more the carbohydrate intake varies, the less likely it is that an estimation rule for doses of short- or very-short-acting insulin will effectively limit glucose variability and achieve a satisfactory level of control as estimated by the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) level. In the patient described above with a relatively low body mass index (BMI), a marked variation in carbohydrate intake would lead to only small changes in dose of a short- or very-short-acting insulin using a standard estimation rule. The practice of counting total carbohydrates (not just simple sugars) is an essential part of medical nutrition therapy for diabetes. In combination with an estimation rule for insulin doses, it provides the patient with a degree of flexibility in diet. But an important objective of counting carbohydrates is to limit variations in carbohydrate intake at a given time of day.</p><p>The combination of variable carbohydrate intake and variable physical exercise is likely to produce marked variability in the blood glucose level. Current estimation rules do not take into account variations in physical activity. Rather, they assume a stable level of physical activity.</p><p>The use of a long-acting insulin such as glargine is a reasonable alternative to an intermediate-acting insulin such as NPH in many instances. But a change in the formulation of basal insulin is likely to provide only marginal benefit if the intake of carbohydrates and the amount of physical exercise are not taken into account.</p><p>Finally, the management of a diabetic patient is an iterative process. In complex situations, reassessment after each change in regimen often identifies additional problems. In this patient, the initiation of physiologic replacement therapy with insulin revealed persistent instability of blood glucose levels. Further analysis revealed variations in carbohydrate intake and in exercise, correction of which led to improved metabolic control.</p><p>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-6-uncontrolled-diabetes-in-a-64-year-old-woman-treated-with-insulin-comment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-6-uncontrolled-diabetes-in-a-64-year-old-woman-treated-with-insulin-comment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Evert AB, Boucher JL, Cypress M, et al.
