Approximately 50 to 77 percent of patients with Mirizzi syndrome are women, which may in part be due to a higher incidence of gallstones in women.

It has been hypothesized that recurrent inflammation and biliary stasis may predispose to both conditions.

In a retrospective study of 4800 patients who underwent cholecystectomy, Mirizzi syndrome was present in 133 patients, of whom seven (5 percent) had gallbladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mirizzi-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder cancer was made in only one of seven patients.

The body extends from the fundus into the tapered portion, or neck. The neck usually forms a gentle curve, the convexity of which forms the infundibulum, or Hartmann&rsquo;s pouch. The gallbladder is connected at its neck to the cystic duct which empties into the common bile duct. Large gallstones can become impacted in the cystic duct or in Hartmann's pouch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54508\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54508 \">figure 1</a>). These stones can produce common hepatic duct obstruction by mechanical obstruction of the hepatic duct because of the proximity of the cystic duct and the common hepatic duct, and secondary inflammation with frequent episodes of cholangitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mirizzi-syndrome/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].

The sensitivity of abdominal ultrasound in the diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome is 23 to 46 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mirizzi-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abdominal CT scan</strong> &mdash; Abdominal CT scan can ascertain if malignancy is present by revealing enlarged porta hepatis lymph nodes or hepatic infiltration or metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mirizzi-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, it does not significantly add to the diagnostic yield of abdominal ultrasound in identifying the cause of biliary obstruction.

In patients with type II, III, and IV anatomy, a laparoscopic approach is possible, but an open procedure may be required. Laparoscopic management of Mirizzi syndrome presents a challenge because the dense adhesions and edematous inflammatory tissue cause distortion of the normal anatomy and increase the risk for biliary injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mirizzi-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Laparoscopic surgery as the primary treatment of Mirizzi syndrome is controversial but has been reported in patients with type I and II Mirizzi anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mirizzi-syndrome/abstract/26,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28-31</a>].

The endoscopic approach included sphincterotomy, mechanical lithotripsy, dissolution therapy with methyl tert-butyl ether, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, and common bile duct stents. Complete clearance of stones from the biliary tree was achieved in only 3 of 13 patients while nine patients were treated with long-term stenting.

The major laboratory findings are elevations in the serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. (See <a href=\"#H853534113\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mirizzi syndrome should be suspected in patients with right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and fever. The diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome requires the presence of the following on abdominal imaging (eg, transabdominal ultrasonography, contrast-enhanced computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram [MRCP]) (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dilatation of the biliary system above the level of the gallbladder neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The presence of a stone impacted in the gallbladder neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An abrupt change to a normal diameter of the common duct below the level of the stone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial diagnostic evaluation in a patient with suspected Mirizzi syndrome usually begins with abdominal ultrasound or CT. In patients with suspected Mirizzi syndrome based on initial imaging or signs and symptoms suggestive of biliary obstruction (right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, elevated liver biochemical tests), we perform MRCP to establish the diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome. We perform cholangiography with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to confirm the diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome and determine if a cholecystobiliary fistula is present. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2407026981\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for Mirizzi syndrome, permitting removal of the causal factors: the inflamed gallbladder and the impacted stone. The surgical approach to Mirizzi syndrome is based on the presence and type of cholecystobiliary fistula. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome is made preoperatively, ERCP can be both diagnostic and therapeutic as a temporizing measure before surgery in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholangitis. If Mirizzi syndrome is diagnosed incidentally at the time of cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiogram should be performed prior to cholecystectomy to confirm the diagnosis and characterize the biliary anatomy. (See <a href=\"#H307447293\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic treatment can be effective as a temporizing measure before surgery and can be definitive treatment for poor surgical candidates. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mirizzi-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Witte CL.
