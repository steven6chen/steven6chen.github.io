Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies (eg, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists) affect glucose control through several mechanisms, including enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, slowed gastric emptying, and reduction of postprandial glucagon and of food intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51832 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will review the mechanism of action and therapeutic utility of DPP-4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

GLP-1 exerts its main effect by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin release from the pancreatic islets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-dpp-4-inhibitors-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

GLP-1-based therapies, including the DPP-4 inhibitors, do not usually cause hypoglycemia unless combined with therapies that can cause hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-dpp-4-inhibitors-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. GLP-1 is considered an incretin and is one of a family of naturally occurring gut hormones that is released in the setting of a meal, but not with intravenous carbohydrate, and stimulates insulin synthesis and secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glucagon-like peptide-1'</a>.)</p><p>DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of oral diabetes drugs that inhibit the enzyme DPP-4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-dpp-4-inhibitors-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. DPP-4 is a ubiquitous enzyme expressed on the surface of most cell types that deactivates a variety of other bioactive peptides, including glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1; therefore, its inhibition could potentially affect glucose regulation through multiple effects. However, DPP-4 inhibitors have a modest effect on GLP-1 levels and activity compared with giving GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Initial therapy in most patients with type 2 diabetes should begin with diet, weight reduction, exercise, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> (in the absence of contraindications). DPP-4 inhibitors can be considered as monotherapy in patients who are intolerant of or have contraindications to metformin, sulfonylureas, or thiazolidinediones, such as patients with chronic kidney disease or who are at particularly high risk for hypoglycemia. DPP-4 inhibitors can be considered as add-on drug therapy for patients who are inadequately controlled on metformin, a thiazolidinedione, or a sulfonylurea. However, their modest glycemia-lowering effectiveness and expense temper our enthusiasm for these drugs. Therapeutic options for initial and subsequent therapy are reviewed in detail separately.

Vildagliptin is available in several countries but not in the United States. Among the DPP-4 inhibitors, patient preference and payer coverage are considerations for selecting a specific agent. If DPP-4 inhibitors are going to be used in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> we prefer linagliptin because it is primarily eliminated via the enterohepatic system.

They result in modest improvement in glycated hemoglobin (A1C). However, there are few head-to-head trials and no clinical trial data on long-term (greater than two-year) safety, mortality, diabetic complications, or health-related quality of life. In an 18-week trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=saxagliptin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">saxagliptin</a> (5 mg) versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sitagliptin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sitagliptin</a> (100 mg) in 800 patients inadequately controlled on a stable dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, there were similar reductions in A1C (-0.52 versus -0.62 percentage points) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-dpp-4-inhibitors-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, the results from a meta-analysis of studies comparing sitagliptin with placebo or vildagliptin with placebo suggest similar efficacy (weighted mean difference in A1C values of -0.74 and -0.73 percent, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.63 and -0.94 to -0.52, for sitagliptin and vildagliptin compared with placebo, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-dpp-4-inhibitors-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

These studies have been performed to satisfy US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cardiovascular disease (CVD) safety requirements. Although these data are reassuring in that there does not appear to be an increased risk of adverse coronary heart disease outcomes with short-term use of DPP-4 inhibitors used in combination with another oral agent, there may be an increased risk of heart failure with specific DPP-4 inhibitors. Longer-term clinical trials are needed to definitively assess the cardiovascular safety of DPP-4 inhibitors. The preliminary claims that DPP-4 inhibitors have a beneficial effect on CVD risk have not been borne out by the studies to date. Of note, the cardiovascular studies to date have been carried out in very high-risk populations, presumably to increase the hazard rate for major CVD events and complete the studies in a relatively brief period of time. Therefore, there are few data on CVD safety or putative benefits in lower-risk patients.</p><p>In trials with median follow-up of 18 to 36 months, the following findings were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes and either a history of CVD or multiple risk factors for vascular disease were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=saxagliptin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">saxagliptin</a> or placebo, in addition to other diabetes medications (predominantly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, sulfonylurea, insulin).

They are, however, more expensive and less potent in lowering glycemia than the glinides, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repaglinide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">repaglinide</a>, which can also be used safely in patients with chronic kidney disease.

They result in modest improvement in glycated hemoglobin (A1C). Among the DPP-4 inhibitors, patient preference and payer coverage are considerations for selecting a specific agent. For patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> in whom a decision has been made to use a DPP-4 inhibitor, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linagliptin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linagliptin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1205905\" class=\"local\">'Choice of DPP-4 inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1206043\" class=\"local\">'Use in chronic kidney disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preliminary claims that DPP-4 inhibitors have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been borne out by the studies to date. Although there does not appear to be an increased risk of adverse coronary heart disease outcomes with short-term use of DPP-4 inhibitors used in combination with another oral agent, there may be an increased risk of heart failure with specific DPP-4 inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H13200853\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, DPP-4 inhibitors are well tolerated. The use of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a slight increased risk of upper respiratory tract infections. There are insufficient data to know if DPP-4 inhibitors cause acute pancreatitis.
