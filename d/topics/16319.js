Dissection occurs when structural integrity of the arterial wall is compromised, allowing blood to collect between layers as an intramural hematoma.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment and prognosis of spontaneous cerebral and cervical artery dissection. Other aspects of this disorder are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous cerebral and cervical artery dissection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28007389\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available evidence suggests that treatment with thrombolytic therapy should not be withheld for eligible patients with very early acute ischemic stroke due to extracranial cervical artery dissection (see <a href=\"#H28007403\" class=\"local\">'Thrombolysis'</a> below). Beyond the hyperacute period, antithrombotic therapy with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet drugs is accepted treatment for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) caused by extracranial artery dissection, although there is controversy regarding the choice between the two (see <a href=\"#H28007410\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> below). In addition, there is controversy regarding the use of thrombolytics and antithrombotic agents for ischemic symptoms in patients with either intracranial dissection alone or intracranial extension of extracranial dissection because of the presumed increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p><p>Less often, endovascular methods or surgical repair have been used to treat dissection, mainly for patients who have recurrent ischemia despite antithrombotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H28007424\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular and surgical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Optimal treatment of dissection remains a challenge due to limitations in rapidly establishing a definitive diagnosis, the overall low incidence, low recurrence rate, and marked variation in patient characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28007396\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE ISCHEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with cervicocephalic dissection who present with transient ischemic attack or acute ischemic stroke, standard approaches to management should be rigorously followed including blood pressure regulation, fluid administration, control of hyperglycemia and other metabolic derangements, and airway management. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-evaluation-initial-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children: Evaluation, initial management, and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of transient ischemic attack and minor ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28007403\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major randomized trials of intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke did not exclude patients with cervicocephalic arterial dissection. While thrombolysis in the setting of dissection may theoretically cause enlargement of the intramural hematoma, accumulating evidence suggests that the effectiveness and safety of thrombolysis for patients with ischemic stroke related to cervical artery dissection are similar to its effectiveness and safety for patients with ischemic stroke from other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Perhaps the strongest evidence, although indirect, comes from a 2011 meta-analysis of individual patient data from 14 retrospective series and 22 case reports involving 180 patients with cervical artery dissection who were treated with thrombolysis and followed for a median of three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. When these patients were compared with matched historic controls from the observational SITS-ISTR registry of patients treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> for acute ischemic stroke, there were no major differences between groups for rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, mortality, excellent outcome, or favorable outcome.</p><p>Given these data, we recommend intravenous thrombolysis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (tPA) for eligible patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 1</a>) with acute ischemic stroke, including those with isolated extracranial or intracranial cervical artery dissection, provided that treatment is initiated within 3 hours of clearly defined symptom onset. For patients who cannot be treated in less than 3 hours, we suggest intravenous alteplase therapy, provided that treatment is initiated within 3 to 4.5 hours of clearly defined symptom onset.

For such patients, early treatment with mechanical thrombectomy using a second-generation stent retriever device is indicated when performed at stroke centers with appropriate expertise, whether or not the patient received treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (tPA). Mechanical thrombectomy may be beneficial up to 24 hours after stroke onset for patients with favorable neuroimaging. The efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy for vertebral and basilar artery occlusions is unproven. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28007410\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antithrombotic therapy, with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet drugs, has been used as treatment for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) caused by cervical arterial dissection. In theory, anticoagulation may prevent occlusion of a stenotic vessel and minimize distal embolization. Extension of an intramural hematoma in the presence of anticoagulation is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the evidence suggests no advantage of anticoagulation over antiplatelet treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an open-label, assessor-blind pilot trial (CADISS), 250 subjects with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection were randomly assigned to antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment for three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. At the end of this period, there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups; ipsilateral ischemic stroke occurred in 3 of 126 (2 percent) in the antiplatelet group and 1 of 124 (1 percent) in the anticoagulant group (odds ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.01-4.23). There were no deaths in either group. There was one major bleeding event, a subarachnoid hemorrhage, in a patient assigned to the anticoagulation group who had a vertebral artery dissection with intracranial extension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of the low stroke rate and rarity of outcome events, the CADISS trial was unable to establish which treatment is superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the investigators estimated that a definitive trial would require approximately 10,000 participants, making such a trial unfeasible given the slow enrollment rate of the CADISS trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2012 meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies with over 1600 patients with cervical artery dissection reported no significant difference in recurrent stroke risk or mortality comparing anticoagulation with antiplatelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similarly, a 2015 meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies with over 1300 subjects who had acute carotid artery dissection found no differences in outcome or complication rates comparing anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, either antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulation are reasonable options for patients with ischemic neurologic symptoms caused by extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection. Antithrombotic treatment must be delayed until 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy but can be started immediately for those who are ineligible for intravenous thrombolytic therapy. Antiplatelet therapy is favored for patients with extracranial dissection who present with nonischemic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H28007438\" class=\"local\">'Choosing therapy for primary and secondary prevention of ischemia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28007417\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no concrete data regarding optimal duration of antithrombotic therapy. The time course of healing of the vessel wall or resolution of vascular abnormalities may be used to guide duration of initial treatment. Most arterial abnormalities stabilize in appearance or resolve by three months, and vessels that fail to reconstitute a normal lumen by six months are highly unlikely to recover at later time points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After three to six months, repeat imaging is suggested to assess vascular status. Multimodal CT or MRI, ultrasonography, or conventional angiography may be used, although serial noninvasive approaches are favored. Further treatment is tailored to imaging findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28007424\"><span class=\"h2\">Endovascular and surgical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endovascular techniques or surgical repair have been used to treat dissection, mainly for patients who have recurrent ischemia despite antithrombotic therapy.</p><p>Endovascular techniques for the treatment of dissection and dissecting aneurysm include angioplasty, stent placement, embolization with various materials, and combinations of such approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Angioplasty and stenting may occlude the false lumen and restore true arterial lumen patency. However, data regarding endovascular treatment of dissection is limited to case reports and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-20</a>]. There are no randomized trial data comparing endovascular techniques with medical therapies, and the long-term safety and durability of these methods are unknown.</p><p>Although unproven, endovascular treatment of intracranial dissection for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage may minimize the risk of rebleeding, a risk that is as high as 40 percent in the first week or so after the event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The morphology of most dissecting aneurysms limits standard surgical clipping.</p><p>In isolated cases, accessible lesions may be treated by surgical vessel reconstruction or bypass around a dissecting aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Other surgical revascularization procedures include extracranial-intracranial bypass, endarterectomy, thrombectomy, and proximal vessel ligation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28007431\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and extracranial carotid or vertebral arterial dissection, the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Stroke Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ASA)</span> guidelines conclude that the use of antithrombotic treatment with either antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for at least three to six months is reasonable, but that the relative efficacy of antiplatelet versus anticoagulation therapy is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Similarly, United Kingdom guidelines published in 2008 from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommend treatment with either anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents, preferably as part of a randomized clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The 2012 American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) guidelines concluded that the available evidence does not demonstrate a significant difference between antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation for the acute treatment of patients with stroke secondary to cervical artery dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Therefore, the ACCP guidelines for such patients follow the general recommendations for patients with noncardioembolic stroke, meaning <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy in the acute phase (within 48 hours of stroke onset) and antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-and-extended-release-dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin-extended-release dipyridamole</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cilostazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cilostazol</a>) for secondary prevention of stroke.

For patients treated with anticoagulation in the acute phase, we suggest stopping warfarin and starting long-term antiplatelet therapy after six months of anticoagulation, as long as symptoms are not recurrent and the arterial lesion is thrombosed or healed. For patients with persistent vascular luminal stenosis, irregularity, or dissecting aneurysm, we suggest continuing anticoagulation with repeat imaging at regular intervals. We use transcranial Doppler, duplex Doppler, CT angiography, and MR angiography to help us decide the status of the arterial system prior to discontinuing anticoagulation therapy.

Earlier retrospective studies suggested that rate of recurrent cervicocephalic dissection, at the initial or remote site, was approximately 1 percent annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. This low rate was called into question by findings from the CADISP study that retrospectively and prospectively recruited 982 patients with cervical artery dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In CADISP, the recurrence rate for extracranial cervical dissection, at only three months, was 2 percent.</p><p>In various reports, the rate of recurrent ischemic symptoms (stroke and transient ischemic attack) after dissection ranges from 0 to 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], but it is likely that the actual rate of recurrent ischemic stroke caused by dissection is at the lower end of this range. The prospective CADISS trial found that the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke at three months was approximately 2 percent, and all recurrences occurred within 10 days of randomization, suggesting that the risk beyond the first two weeks is extremely low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Prospective data from the CADISS study also suggest that extracranial cervical dissecting aneurysms have a benign prognosis, with a low rate (1 of 48, or approximately 2 percent) of ischemic stroke during 12 months of follow-up, similar to the rate observed in dissections without aneurysm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Another study evaluated 432 surviving patients with carotid or vertebral dissection who were followed for a mean time of 31 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Recurrent ischemic stroke due to initial or recurrent dissection was observed in four patients (0.9 percent), giving an annual incidence of 0.3 percent. Transient ischemic attack was observed in eight patients (1.8 percent), for an annual incidence of 0.6 percent.</p><p>The risk of recurrent hemorrhagic and ischemic symptoms following intracranial dissection may be relatively high, at least in Asian populations. As an example, a study from Japan followed 143 patients with intracranial artery dissection for a mean of 8 years and reported symptomatic recurrence (both hemorrhage and ischemia) in 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Recurrent dissection may affect several vessels at once, even when preceded by initial dissection isolated to one artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Although data are limited, rare patients with familial dissection tend to be young (mean age 36 years) and are probably at high risk for recurrent or multiple dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H498390474\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Beyond the hyperacute period, antithrombotic therapy with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet drugs is accepted treatment for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) caused by extracranial artery dissection, although there is controversy regarding the choice between the two (see <a href=\"#H28007410\" class=\"local\">'Antithrombotic therapy'</a> above). There is controversy regarding the use of thrombolytics and antithrombotic agents for ischemic symptoms in patients with either intracranial dissection alone or intracranial extension of extracranial dissection because of the presumed increased risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Endovascular methods or surgical repair have been used to treat dissection, mainly for patients who have recurrent ischemia despite antithrombotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H28007389\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend intravenous thrombolysis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> for eligible patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 1</a>) with acute ischemic stroke, including those with isolated extracranial or intracranial cervical artery dissection, provided that treatment is initiated within 3 hours of clearly defined symptom onset (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).

However, some experts, including one of the authors of this topic (DL), prefer anticoagulation rather than aspirin in this setting. Antithrombotic treatment must be delayed until 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy but can be started immediately for those who are not treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy. The choice between antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy should be guided by the clinical experience of the treating physician and by patient values and preferences, comorbid conditions, and tolerance of these agents.
