Humans exhibit variable susceptibility to malarial infection; most of the resistance to this infection is either genetic, environmental, based upon previous exposure, or access to therapy.</p><p>A study of the relative importance of each of these factors to the overall burden of malarial disease in human populations was examined in Sri Lanka. Longitudinal studies showed that 20 percent of the variation in the intensity of disease was explained by repeatable differences between patients and approximately half was attributable to host genetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A similar analysis in Africa demonstrated 25 percent of the total variation in the incidence of hospital admission for malaria was explained by additively-acting host genes, with 2 percent of this variation due to presence of the sickle cell trait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The role of certain blood group antigens in malarial infection and genetic resistance to malaria associated with abnormalities in the red cell cytoskeleton will be reviewed here. The overall subject of anemia in malaria, as well as malarial resistance associated with the hemoglobinopathies (eg, hemoglobins S, C, E, thalassemia), are discussed separately.

Genetic resistance is much better defined for the erythrocytic stage and may involve one or more of the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of merozoite entry into the red cell</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment of intracellular parasite growth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of the erythrocyte lysis that occurs with parasite maturation, leading to release of merozoites into the bloodstream</p><p/><p>Malarial invasion of the red cell is a complex process, involving initial nonspecific attachment, reorientation of the polarity of the merozoite, red cell membrane flapping, and the zipper-type introjection of the merozoite into the red cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is therefore not surprising that mutations involving the red cell membrane (eg, surface antigens and cytoskeletal proteins) could interfere with such invasion.</p><p>As will be described below, malarial invasion of the red cells requires both red cell receptors, such as the Duffy blood group antigen for Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and glycophorin A for P. falciparum, and parasite proteins that bind to the receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/2,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RED CELL SURFACE ANTIGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Red cell surface antigens can affect the likelihood of developing malaria.

Both Fya and Fyb reside in a glycoprotein of about 40 kD, known as the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC, CD234), which acts as a receptor for certain pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, RANTES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies#H45\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;, section on 'Duffy blood group system'</a>.)</p><p>Duffy antigen negativity corresponds to a null genotype in which neither the Fya nor Fyb antigen (Fy(a-b-)) is expressed. Most Duffy-negative people of African descent have a silent Fyb allele with a single nucleotide substitution that impairs promoter activity in erythroid cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The percent of the population with the Fy(a-b-) phenotype reaches 100 percent in much of Sub-Saharan Africa. It seems that its selective advantage (ie, resistance to invasion by the merozoites of P. vivax) has driven this phenotype nearly to fixation. In Gambian individuals, for example, 100 percent are Duffy negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This trait is also found in Arabs, Oriental Jews, the Druzes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and in Papua New Guinea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Fy(a-b-) erythrocytes were first shown to be resistant to invasion by the merozoites of P. knowlesi, a Plasmodium similar to P. vivax that normally infects monkeys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The importance of the Duffy blood group system in P. vivax infection and other malaria infections in man has been shown in several ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 1958 study performed before in vitro malaria cultures were available, human volunteers were exposed to mosquitoes infected with P. vivax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Subsequent studies narrowed the binding site on the Duffy antigen to a 35 amino acid region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>P. vivax infections have been reported as not infrequent occurrences in Duffy-negative individuals in Madagascar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Intriguingly, PF-4 appears to bind to infected red blood cells by the Duffy antigen. These in vitro phenomena suggest somewhat paradoxically that Duffy negative individuals would be at a disadvantage when infected with falciparum malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The role of this pathway of parasite killing in patients with malaria remains to be determined.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Parasite proteins that bind to Duffy antigen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One protein from P. vivax and three proteins from the simian malarial organism P. knowlesi have been described that bind to the Duffy blood group antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These proteins shared sequence homology and a cysteine-rich domain was found within P. vivax Duffy Binding Ligand which mediated adhesion to Duffy blood group-positive but not Duffy blood group-negative human erythrocytes. The homologous domain of the proteins from P. knowlesi also bound erythrocytes but had different specificities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The erythrocyte binding domains in these proteins, namely the Duffy binding domains, also showed sequence conservation with the domain for erythrocyte binding in the P. falciparum protein, erythrocyte-binding antigen-175, which bound to sialic acid on human erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The conservation of this binding domain between distant malarial species strongly suggests that these structures are functionally significant and might therefore be potential vaccine candidates.</p><p>These suggestions are consistent with hyper-variability of the erythrocyte-binding domain in the P. vivax Duffy-binding protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The binding domains within these erythrocyte-binding proteins (PvDBPs) lie within a conserved N-terminal cysteine-rich region of 330 amino acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Recombinant proteins have been developed that stimulate blocking antibodies and block erythrocyte invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There is considerable natural variation in the sequence of the binding domains in PvDBPs, and multiple alleles of this parasite protein are being tested to induce strain-transcending immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, human vaccination with P. vivax Duffy-binding protein region II (Salvador strain) using a prime-boost strategy appears to induce strain-transcending antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and may allow a vaccine that elicits an immune response able to block red cell invasion of the malarial parasite <em>Plasmodium vivax</em>. Vaccine development is discussed in more detail separately.

This is somewhat puzzling as a malarial ligand for glycophorin A has been identified (EBA-175) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and monoclonal antibodies to glycophorin A inhibit invasion of P. falciparum and P. knowlesi in vitro, while antibodies against glycophorin B, Rh, and Kell determinants have no effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>A novel malaria resistance locus was reported close to the cluster of genes encoding glycophorins, and the MalGen consortium found that a haplotype at this locus provides 33 percent protection against severe malaria (odds ratio [OR] 0.67; 95% CI 0.60-0.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The protective allele was not obvious, and a series of genetic analyses has demonstrated complex copy number variants (CNVs) at this locus. Genome sequencing was used to define reference sequences that allowed CNVs to be determined in over 3000 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Eight deletions and eight duplications were found, as well as 11 singleton variants in the glycophorin region. The combined allele frequency of glycophorin CNVs in African populations was 11 percent compared with 1.1 percent in non-African populations. One of the imputed CNVs, <em>DUP4</em>, is associated with decreased risk of severe malaria (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.50-0.72), reducing the risk of both cerebral malaria and severe malarial anemia. The copy number profile of <em>DUP4</em> is complex, and the gene encodes a protein where the extracellular domain of GYPB joins the transmembrane and intracellular domains of GYPA, creating a peptide sequence at their junction that is characteristic of the Dantu antigen in the MNS blood group system. Further family studies confirmed the identification of <em>DUP4</em> as the variant encoding the Dantu+ (NE type) blood group phenotype. A single study reports parasite growth to be impaired in Dantu+ cells, consistent with the genetic epidemiology that the DUP4 variant encoding the Dantu NE blood group antigen is associated with protection from malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">ABO(H) blood group system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two studies have suggested that group A red cells are associated with severe malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>] while two additional studies, including a large study of 9000 children, have shown conclusively that blood group O confers protection (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.09-1.32) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. These observations are consistent with the low frequency of blood group A in many endemic malarial areas. Possible mechanisms for such a protective effect include the modulation of rosetting of uninfected red blood cells by infected red blood cells as well as the adherence of infected red blood cells to host receptors on monocytes, platelets, and endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

BAEBL is one of four P. falciparum invasion proteins with Duffy-binding like domains (DBLs) and the BAEBL allele containing threonine at position 121 (T121) (VSTK) can bind to glycophorin C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>In other reports, a normal protein 4.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/glycophorin</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">C/p55</span> complex appears to be important for P. falciparum invasion and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. The 4.1 protein is also involved in the binding to the red cell cytoskeleton of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP1), a protein involved in adhesion of malaria-infected red cells to the vascular endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

Erythrocyte invasion was inhibited by soluble basigin or by basigin knockdown, and invasion could be completely blocked using low concentrations of anti-basigin antibodies across all laboratory strains. Furthermore, Ok(a-) erythrocytes, which express a basigin variant that has a weaker binding affinity for PfRh5, had reduced invasion efficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, it is puzzling that Ok blood group antigens are not obviously polymorphic in malaria endemic regions. Nevertheless, these findings have provoked renewed interest in further explorations of PfRh5 as a vaccine candidate antigen. A series of papers has demonstrated that recombinant PfRh5 can induce antibodies in humans that block invasion of red blood cells by merozoites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>] and a recombinant chimeric antibody (Ab-1) against basigin inhibited the PfRH5-basigin interaction and blocked erythrocyte invasion across multiple parasite strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Intriguingly, binding of PFRh5 to basigin may be responsible for the species specificity of PfRH5 binding and provide a molecular basis for the restriction of P. falciparum to its human host among other primates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RED CELLS WITH CYTOSKELETAL ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In view of the complexity of malarial invasion of the red cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], it is not surprising that mutations in genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins could lead to red cell resistance to P. falciparum. Protection against malaria has been associated with three genetic disorders involving the red cell cytoskeleton: Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, and hereditary spherocytosis. A discussion of the functions of the different cytoskeletal proteins can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-membrane-structure-organization-and-dynamics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell membrane: Structure, organization, and dynamics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Southeast Asian ovalocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Southeast Asian or Melanesian ovalocytosis (SAO), the sole highly polymorphic red cell cytoskeleton abnormality, is present in about 30 percent of the Melanesian population of Papua New Guinea and other aboriginal populations of Southeast Asia. It results from mutations in band 3 protein, which primarily functions as a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger. The net effect of this mutation is a red cell with increased rigidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary elliptocytosis and related disorders&quot;, section on 'Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO)'</a>.)</p><p>Epidemiologic evidence suggests that SAO confers resistance to high levels of parasitemia with P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>]. It may also protect against cerebral malaria in patients infected with P. falciparum. In one study of inhabitants of the Madang area of Papua New Guinea, for example, heterozygous SAO was present in 15 percent of all inhabitants, 9 percent of those who had uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, and in none of those with potentially life-threatening cerebral malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. However, the prevalence of ovalocytosis did not differ between children with and without acute P. falciparum malaria, suggesting that ovalocytosis protects from dying of malaria but not from acquiring malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>These observations are consistent with in vitro studies. Melanesian ovalocytes are highly resistant to invasion by P. falciparum merozoites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>]. They are also resistant to invasion by P. knowlesi, a plasmodium similar to P. vivax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Interestingly, a similar defect in P. knowlesi invasion can be induced in normal erythrocytes by monoclonal antibodies directed against band 3, the protein that is abnormal in SAO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>Why merozoites are unable to invade the ovalocytic cell is not well understood. Inhibition of invasion of two types of plasmodia suggests involvement of a later stage of invasion than receptor recognition. In vitro studies suggest that it is decreased deformability, not the ovalocytic shape per se, that is of primary importance in protecting against malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>] and that the degree of impaired invasion is closely related to the degree of reduced deformability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>There is an additional aspect to this relationship, since malaria infection also induces the generation of ovalocytes. In one series from Thailand, individuals infected with malaria had a higher percent of ovalocytes than uninfected controls (6.3 percent with P. falciparum, 8.3 percent with P. vivax, and 0.6 percent in uninfected controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

HE red cells demonstrate resistance to invasion by both P. knowlesi and P. falciparum. Indirect evidence for protection against clinical disease comes from the observation that HE is found in high prevalence in regions in which malaria has been or is endemic. As an example, the prevalence of HE in the United States is 2.5 to 5 per 10,000 but may be greater than 1 to 10 percent in areas in which malaria is endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-91</a>].

Red cell membrane proteins may become modified during intracellular growth of P. falciparum. One example is an 80 kD phosphoprotein associated with the red cell membrane of P. falciparum-infected cells. This protein appears to be a phosphorylated form of protein 4.1, since it is not seen in infected HE cells that are completely devoid of protein 4.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Growth was normal during the first two days, followed by impaired growth, the onset of which was more rapid in cells with greater degrees of spectrin deficiency.

Heterozygous ankyrin-1 null mice have wild-type levels of ankyrin-1 and spectrin with normal red cell survival but are nevertheless protected from malaria.

One possible mechanism by which parasite growth is impaired, as mentioned above, is accumulation of MESA in protein 4.1-deficient cells. Other possibilities include involvement of host cytoskeletal proteins in the generation of the parasite membrane or the insertion of parasite proteins into the red cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>Parasitization with P. falciparum also induces a loss of red cell deformability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>].
