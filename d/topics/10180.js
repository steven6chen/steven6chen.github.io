The pulmonary disease may proceed or follow the diagnosis of the underlying process, whether it is Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome or another rheumatic disease or dysproteinemia.

The etiology of GLILD is not known, but may be related to human herpes virus type 8 (HHV8) infection. On histopathology, follicular bronchiolitis may accompany GLILD.

LIP occurs in 25 to 40 percent of children with perinatally acquired HIV and usually presents in the second or third year of life. LIP is less common in adults with HIV infection, particularly in those treated with antiretroviral therapy. LIP can be seen in 27 to 59 percent of HIV-infected patients with diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS), which usually presents with salivary gland enlargement and xerostomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphoid-interstitial-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In situ hybridization studies of biopsy specimens of patients with LIP (both with and without HIV) show a significant increase in the presence of EBV genome compared to other chronic lung disease specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphoid-interstitial-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

According to the American Thoracic <span class=\"nowrap\">Society/European</span> Respiratory Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(ATS/ERS)</span> classification, the characteristic feature of LIP is extensive alveolar septal infiltration, although the cellular infiltrate may sometimes appear along bronchi and vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53820\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53820 \">picture 2</a>). Thus, LIP is differentiated from diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia, which predominantly affects areas of the interstitium other than alveolar septa (eg, bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphoid-interstitial-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/4,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23,24</a>]. </p><p>The histopathology of granulomatous and lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD), a variant of LIP that may develop in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), often shows both peribronchiolar and diffuse interstitial infiltration, and &gt;90 percent of patients will also have granulomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphoid-interstitial-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Three patients progressed to end-stage lung disease; malignant transformation was not noted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While approximately 5 percent of patients with LIP develop lymphoma and the risk of lymphoma is increased in patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, it is unclear whether LIP undergoes malignant transformation or whether the lymphoma develops as a comorbid process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphoid-interstitial-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/2,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,51-54</a>]. Lymphomas arising in association with LIP lesions are generally associated with prolonged survival, as they are typically well-differentiated and slow growing mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphoid-interstitial-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/11,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,53</a>].</p><p>Secondary infections are a serious and potentially fatal complication of the primary immunologic abnormality (eg, HIV, hypogammaglobulinemia) or as a complication of immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphoid-interstitial-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/8,9,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,32</a>]. Infections with both typical and atypical organisms occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features and diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is characterized by infiltration of the interstitium and alveolar spaces of the lung by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and other lymphoreticular elements. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LIP represents a benign polyclonal proliferation (usually of mature B or T cells) that can involve the lung diffusely, or be a focal process. Germinal centers, noncaseating granulomas, and multinucleated giant cells may also be seen. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the disease progresses, fibrotic and cystic changes are seen along with loss of lung parenchyma. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specific etiology of LIP is unknown: its association with autoimmune diseases (eg, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus) suggests an autoimmune etiology and its association with HIV infection suggests a possible infectious etiology (especially viral). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations include cough, dyspnea, and less commonly, weight loss and fever. Lung examination reveals crackles. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On high resolution chest CT, ground-glass attenuation, centrilobular nodules (single or multiple) or masses, mixed ground glass-consolidative opacities, and septal thickening are typical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89082\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89082 \">image 1</a>). Lung cysts are also common, especially in HIV-associated LIP. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Chest imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy is often <strong>required</strong> to confirm the diagnosis, as biopsy specimens need to be large enough for the pathologist to define architectural elements and test for clonality. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with idiopathic or rheumatic disease-associated LIP who are asymptomatic and have mild disease (based on physiologic and radiographic studies), we suggest not initiating treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We follow these patients with longitudinal assessment of clinical, functional, and radiological parameters. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults with LIP associated with rheumatic disease who are symptomatic, have significant physiologic impairment, or who demonstrate progressive disease on longitudinal assessments, we suggest treatment with oral glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We typically administer oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (or the equivalent dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>) 0.25 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> given once a day (based upon the patient's ideal body weight but not exceeding 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. The course of therapy is usually 6 to 12 months. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with idiopathic LIP, we typically follow the regimen outlined for LIP in rheumatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with idiopathic LIP, who do not respond to, or are intolerant of glucocorticoid therapy, we suggest adding an additional immunosuppressive agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest Pneumocystis prophylaxis for any patient with LIP receiving moderate to high dose glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 20 mg or more per day) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We also suggest Pneumocystis prophylaxis in patients treated with a combination of glucocorticoid and another immunosuppressive agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis'</a>). We follow current treatment recommendations for prevention of other potential adverse effects of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In HIV-infected adult patients with symptomatic LIP and no other indication for antiretroviral therapy (ART), we suggest initiating ART (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest not initiating glucocorticoid therapy until after a trial of optimal ART (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients whose LIP progresses despite optimal ART, we follow the treatment protocol for glucocorticoid therapy outlined for LIP in rheumatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant transformation of LIP to lymphoma may infrequently occur years after the initial diagnosis. Lymphomas arising from LIP lesions are associated with prolonged survival, as they are well differentiated and slow growing.
