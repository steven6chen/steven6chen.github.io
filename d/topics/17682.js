Approximately 10 percent of patients with aneurysmal SAH die prior to reaching the hospital, 25 percent die within 24 hours of SAH onset, and about 45 percent die within 30 days; only one-third of patients will have a good outcome after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>The most important predictive factors for acute prognosis after SAH include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level of consciousness and neurologic grade on admission</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient age (inverse correlation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amount of blood on initial head computed tomography (CT) scan (inverse correlation)</p><p/><p>Among patients who reach the hospital alive, much of the subsequent early mortality is caused by the common complications of aneurysmal SAH, which include rebleeding, vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia, hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and cardiac complications. Therapeutic advances have added to the armamentarium for treating these malignant processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A reduction of case-fatality rates from 1971 to 2002 in one study and from 1981 to 1986 and 2002 to 2008 in another study may reflect an improved approach to management over these time periods. However, with some exceptions, high quality clinical trials to support these treatments are generally lacking. </p><p>The treatment of aneurysmal SAH and its complications is reviewed here.

In addition, any anticoagulant effect should be reversed immediately with appropriate agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a>, fresh frozen plasma, or unactivated prothrombin complex concentrate, which is also called factor IX complex. We use the therapeutic approach that is recommended for warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage.

While some concern has been raised about precipitating rebleeding with abrupt lowering of ICP, this has not been substantiated in clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraventricular-hemorrhage#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraventricular hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'External ventricular drain'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;, section on 'ICP monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>Patients without a ventriculostomy can be managed medically with osmotic therapy and diuresis. Hyperventilation is generally avoided because it may precipitate or exacerbate vasospasm. The use of hypertonic saline has been evaluated in patients with elevated ICP related to traumatic brain injury and appears to lower ICP and may improve cerebral perfusion. A small observational study in 16 patients with poor-grade SAH suggests that it may also be useful in this setting; but further study is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults#H267641463\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;, section on 'Osmotic therapy and diuresis'</a>.)</p><p>In some cases, decompressive craniectomy may be needed for ICP control, in the setting of intracerebral hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe cerebral edema.

No blood pressure target has been defined in acute aneurysmal SAH with an unsecured aneurysm. The 2012 American Stroke Association guidelines suggest that a decrease in systolic blood pressure to &lt;160mm Hg is reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When blood pressure control is necessary, the use of vasodilators such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> should be avoided because of their propensity to increase cerebral blood volume and therefore intracranial pressure. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Labetalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> are preferred. </p><p>While lowering blood pressure may decrease the risk of rebleeding in a patient with an unsecured aneurysm, this benefit may be offset by an increased risk of infarction. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) equals the mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus the ICP. Thus, with increased ICP, cerebral perfusion may be impaired, and increases in MAP may be the only means to maintain CPP at a level necessary to prevent infarction. One study&rsquo;s results suggest that this CPP threshold may be 70 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In one report of 134 patients with SAH, 80 received antihypertensive therapy to lower the diastolic pressure below 100 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The patients given antihypertensive therapy had a lower incidence of rebleeding (15 versus 33 percent) that was offset by a higher incidence of infarction (43 versus 22 percent).</p><p>In the absence of ICP measurement, antihypertensive therapy is often withheld unless there is a severe elevation in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The patient&rsquo;s cognitive status may be a useful guide; if the patient is alert, then CPP is adequate, and lowering the blood pressure may decrease the risk of rerupture; we typically keep the systolic blood pressure in such patients below 140 mmHg. In contrast, antihypertensive therapy is generally withheld in those with a severely impaired level of consciousness since the impairment may be due to a reduced CPP. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiepileptic drug therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to prevent seizures in patients with SAH has been a widely debated topic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/7,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,44,45</a>]. Many experts believe that seizure prophylaxis in the setting of an unsecured aneurysm is reasonable, given the relatively low risk associated with AED administration versus the potential deleterious effects of seizures on an already dysautoregulated brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/4,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,46</a>]. However, evidence from a large case series suggests that AED exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> may be associated with worse neurologic and cognitive outcome after SAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Therefore, the use of AEDs for seizure prophylaxis after SAH should probably be minimized whenever possible; and phenytoin is generally avoided.</p><p>The decision to treat with antiepileptic agents may be based in part upon the distribution of blood on axial imaging studies. A lower impetus to start AEDs is warranted in the setting of perimesencephalic blood without cortical layering, since this pattern of hemorrhage is associated with a particularly good prognosis. In contrast, initiation of AEDs in higher risk patients with poor neurologic grade, unsecured aneurysm and associated intracerebral hemorrhage may be reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

While these agents do not have an established role in the management of aneurysmal SAH, the 2012 American Stroke Association guidelines state that when definitive treatment of the aneurysm is unavoidably delayed and there are no other contraindications to treatment, short term therapy (&lt;72 hours) with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid is reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of nine trials concluded that although antifibrinolytic treatment reduces the risk of rebleeding (odds ratio [OR] 0.55, 95% CI 0.42-0.71), it does not show any evidence of reducing poor outcome defined as death, vegetative state, or severe disability (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.88-1.43) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].
