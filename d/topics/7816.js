Insulin resistance may also be a contributing factor, since it has been demonstrated in more than 80 percent of critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Hyperglycemia was previously considered an adaptive response essential for survival and was not routinely controlled in intensive care units (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

However, this evidence does not prove that hyperglycemia causes poor clinical outcomes, since hyperglycemia may merely be a marker of severe illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are hyperglycemic following trauma have an increased mortality rate, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, and incidence of nosocomial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. This was illustrated by a prospective cohort study of 1003 patients who were admitted to an ICU following trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Hyperglycemia (blood glucose &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [12.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> was present in 255 patients (25 percent) at the time of ICU admission.

In a retrospective cohort study of 77 patients with severe traumatic brain injury, hyperglycemia (blood glucose &ge;170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [9.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> at the time of ICU admission was an independent predictor of a poor Glasgow coma score five days later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The association between hyperglycemia and adverse outcomes in trauma patients exists regardless of whether the hyperglycemia is present only at ICU admission or persists throughout the ICU stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. One prospective cohort study of 942 trauma patients admitted to an ICU found that patients whose blood glucose was elevated at ICU admission (blood glucose &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> increased during the ICU stay, or was highly variable during the ICU stay had an increased mortality rate, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU and hospital length of stay, compared to patients with alternative patterns of glucose control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical/surgical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Critically ill medical and surgical patients who are hyperglycemic have a higher mortality rate than patients who are normoglycemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

However, the optimal blood glucose range is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Numerous clinical trials have compared different ranges of blood glucose in various populations of critically ill patients, some of which are described in this section. Their impact on patient care is described in the next section.

While one trial initially reported improved mortality (the Leuven surgical trial) associated with IIT, a subsequent trial (Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation [NICE-SUGAR] trial) reported increased mortality in its surgical subgroup. In all trials, patients who received IIT had a significantly increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. Our suggested approach to the management of these patients is presented below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> below.) </p><p>A single center trial (the Leuven surgical trial) randomly assigned 1548 surgical ICU patients to receive IIT or conventional blood glucose management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. IIT was defined as an insulin infusion targeting a blood glucose of 80 to 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 to 6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Conventional blood glucose management targeted a blood glucose of 180 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and used an insulin infusion only if the blood glucose was greater than 215 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Patients in both arms of the trial were given 200 to 300 grams of intravenous glucose during the first day of ICU admission. In the majority of patients, parenteral nutrition was added to enteral nutrition on the second day of ICU admission if necessary to achieve the caloric goal.</p><p>Most patients were adult (mean age 63 years) males (71 percent) who had undergone cardiac surgery (63 percent) and were not severely ill (mean Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE II] score was 9). The following outcomes were detected:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean blood glucose was significantly lower in the IIT group (103 versus 153 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.7 versus 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ICU mortality was significantly lower in the IIT group (4.6 versus 8 percent).

These mortality rates are higher than the 1.5 to 3.5 percent reported for most patients undergoing routine cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This high mortality raises the possibility that there was a harmful intervention in the control group that was ameliorated by IIT. One possibility is that the large glucose load administered on the first and second ICU day was harmful to the control group, but not the IIT group, because the IIT group was rescued by its more aggressive insulin regimen.</p><p>These findings were supported by a meta-analysis of five randomized trials (1972 patients) that compared IIT to less stringent glycemic control in surgical ICU patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. IIT was defined as a target blood glucose level &le;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Patients who received IIT had significantly lower mortality than those who received less stringent glycemic control (7.4 versus 11.8 percent, relative risk 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.91). However, the results of the meta-analysis were largely driven by the Leuven surgical trial, an important limitation.</p><p>In contrast, when the NICE-SUGAR trial analyzed its surgical patients, there was increased mortality among those who received IIT compared to those who received conventional glucose control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These findings are described in detail below.

Participants were randomly assigned to tight glycemic control using an insulin-dosing algorithm targeting a blood glucose of 80 to 110 mg per dL (4.4 to 6.1 mmol per L) or standard care. Tight glycemic control, as compared with standard care in the ICU, did not change the rate of health care-associated infections (primary end-point), mortality, the length of stay in the ICU, or several organ-specific end points. Severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;40 mg per deciliter [2.2 mmol per liter]) occurred in 3 percent of patients in the tight glycemic control group and 1 percent of the standard care group. The incidence of hypoglycemia in the tight control group was lower than in other similar trials, which the authors attributed in part to use of subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring that alerted nursing staff to actual or impending hypoglycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several trials of tight glucose control in medical patients have reported no mortality benefit and a significant increased frequency of hypoglycemia. Our suggested approach to the management of these patients is presented below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> below.) </p><p>The same investigators who performed the Leuven surgical trial conducted a similar trial exclusively in critically ill medical patients. The single center trial (the Leuven medical trial) randomly assigned 1200 medical ICU patients to receive IIT (target blood glucose level of 80 to 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.4 to 6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> or conventional glucose control (target blood glucose of 180 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [10 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The insulin infusion protocols and nutritional strategies were the same as the Leuven surgical trial (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Surgical patients'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean blood glucose was lower in the IIT group than the conventional therapy group (105 versus 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.8 versus 8.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IIT did not change overall hospital mortality (37.3 versus 40 percent in the control group)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IIT significantly reduced ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and acute kidney failure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoglycemia was significantly more common in the IIT group (18.7 versus 3.1 percent)</p><p/><p>Like the Leuven surgical trial, the nutritional approach in the Leuven medical trial (ie, glucose loading by adding early <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> to enteral nutrition) is not the standard of care worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. As a result, the results of this trial are not generalizable to patients who receive a more usual nutritional approach, such as enteral nutrition started early and increased over the first few ICU days.</p><p>A more recent trial supports the notion that strict blood glucose control is not beneficial in medical patients. The Corticosteroids and Intensive Insulin Therapy for Septic Shock (COIITSS) trial randomly assigned 509 patients with septic shock who were receiving corticosteroids to either intensive insulin therapy using the same protocol as the Leuven medical trial or conventional blood glucose control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For the latter group, the blood glucose target, insulin dose, and route of administration were left to the discretion of the clinician, although they were encouraged to target a blood glucose level &lt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The trial found no difference in mortality, ICU length of stay, ventilator-free days, or vasopressor-free days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixed patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several randomized trials have evaluated IIT in mixed populations of critically ill medical and surgical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/19,29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29-34</a>]. At least two of the trials were stopped early for safety. Most trials have reported no mortality benefit. In addition, severe hypoglycemia due to tight glucose control strategies was also associated with increased mortality in some of the trials (NICE-SUGAR). Meta-analyses have been performed in an effort to consolidate the data from numerous randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/18,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,35-37</a>].

Pre-specified subgroup analysis did not identify any patient group (cardiac or non-cardiac) that might gain a mortality benefit from tight glycemic control. Compared to conventional glycemic control, severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;36 mg per deciliter [2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> occurred more frequently in the tight-glycemic-control group (7 versus 2 percent). Compared to patients without hypoglycemia, patients with at least one episode of hypoglycemia had increased mortality (11 versus 4 percent), an effect which was most pronounced in those who had undergone cardiac surgery (11 versus 2 percent). The achieved target glucose levels (mean over 10 days) were 107 and 114 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.9 and 6.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> in the tight and conventional glycemic control groups, respectively. The lower than expected mean glucose level in the conventional group may have limited the overall analysis. </p><p>The HALF-Pint trial (similarly designed to SPECS), compared high and low blood glucose target levels in 713 hyperglycemic critically-ill children (2 weeks to 17 years with two blood glucose levels &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> before intervention). Patients who had undergone cardiac surgery were excluded. The number of ICU-free days was no different among those with a lower target blood glucose level of 80 to 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 to 6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> compared with a higher target level of 150 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Also reported in the lower target group were higher rates of hypoglycemia (5 versus 2 percent) and healthcare-associated infections (3 versus 1 percent), but mortality, severity of organ dysfunction, and number of ventilator-free days were no different. Noteworthy, is that patients in the higher target group had a lower than expected mean blood glucose level (123 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [6.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> which may have limited the analysis. This trial was stopped early on the basis of low likelihood of benefit and possibility of harm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In mixed <strong>adult</strong> populations of critically ill medical and surgical patients, IIT (target blood glucose of 80 to 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.4 to 6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> increased the incidence of severe hypoglycemia and either increased mortality or had no effect on mortality, when compared to the more permissive blood glucose ranges of 140 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and 180 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.

Larger randomized trials demonstrating a mortality benefit are required before hypoglycemia protocols can be routinely used for the management of hypoglycemia in the ICU. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend a blood glucose target of 140 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in most critically ill adult patients, rather than a more stringent target (eg, 80 to 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.4 to 6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> or a more liberal target (eg, 180 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [10 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. This range avoids marked hyperglycemia, while minimizing the risk of both iatrogenic hypoglycemia and other harms associated with a lower blood glucose target. The following evidence supports our approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperglycemia, defined as a blood glucose level greater than 180 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> is associated with poor clinical outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Effects of hyperglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stringent intensive insulin therapy regimens (IIT) that target blood glucose range of 80 to 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 to 6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> significantly increase the incidence of severe hypoglycemia and may increase mortality, especially when compared with less stringent regimens (eg, target blood glucose range of 140 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [7.8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic control'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hypoglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients managed with our blood glucose target had a significantly lower mortality and incidence of hypoglycemia in the largest trial that directly compared our recommended blood glucose target to IIT. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'NICE-SUGAR trial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>To achieve the target blood glucose range in adult patients, we first attempt to avoid or minimize the use of intravenous fluids (IVFs) that contain glucose and administer insulin only when necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The same basic principles apply in pediatric patients with the exception that children (particularly young children) generally require dextrose in maintenance IVF to ensure adequate glucose delivery to avoid hypoglycemia and provide nutrition. Other sources of glucose (eg, IV medications) should be limited in critically ill children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children#H254791451\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance fluid therapy in children&quot;, section on 'Dextrose'</a>.) </p><p>There is no universally accepted insulin regimen for glycemic control in critically ill patients. However, to avoid prolonged hypoglycemia, which may be harmful in this population, insulin infusions and intermittent short-acting insulin are typically used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Careful monitoring of blood glucose is mandatory to achieve the target range and avoid hypoglycemia. Once the acute illness has resolved, transitioning to longer-acting insulin in the ICU has been shown to be safe in patients who are being enterally fed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].
