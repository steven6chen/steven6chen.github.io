They account for 0.5 to 3 percent of all functioning pituitary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tsh-secreting-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and much less than 1 percent of all cases of hyperthyroidism.

Nevertheless, the diagnosis should be considered in all hyperthyroid patients, especially those with a diffuse goiter and no extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves' disease.</p><p>This topic will review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of TSH-secreting pituitary tumors. Other causes of hyperthyroidism are reviewed separately.

Thus, TSH secretion usually does not increase much in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and does not decrease much in response to exogenous thyroid hormone administration. The biological activity of the TSH that is secreted varies considerably; as a result, serum immunoreactive TSH concentrations range from normal (albeit inappropriately high in the presence of hyperthyroidism) to markedly elevated (&gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tsh-secreting-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Most TSH-secreting adenomas secrete only TSH. However, approximately 20 to 25 percent of the adenomas secrete one or more other pituitary hormones, predominantly growth hormone or prolactin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tsh-secreting-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There have been no reported instances of co-secretion of corticotropin (ACTH) and TSH.</p><p>Adenomas secreting TSH and growth hormone are equally common in men and women, whereas co-secretion of TSH and prolactin is approximately five times more common in women than in men. Hyperprolactinemia is not always due to tumor secretion of prolactin; in some patients, it is caused by compression of the pituitary stalk and interruption of tonic hypothalamic inhibition of prolactin secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyperprolactinemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyperprolactinemia&quot;, section on 'Decreased dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin secretion'</a>.)</p><p>The molecular basis of TSH-secreting adenomas is not known.

The subsequent finding of a pituitary macroadenoma by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very strong evidence that the patient has a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, particularly in the presence of an elevated alpha subunit.

Serum total T4 and total T3 concentrations may be increased because of increased protein binding of the hormones in serum. These conditions include elevations in serum T4-binding globulin concentrations, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (in which an abnormal albumin with increased affinity for T4 is produced), and the presence of anti-T4 antibodies. Patients with these conditions are euthyroid and have normal serum TSH concentrations, elevated total T4, and elevated total T3 but usually normal serum free T4 and free T3 concentrations when measured by appropriate methods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and hypothyroxinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presence of heterophilic antibodies can interfere with TSH measurements in immunometric assays. These human anti-mouse gamma globulins can bridge the two mouse monoclonal antibodies (solid phase antibody and signal antibody) and cause spuriously elevated readings for TSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tsh-secreting-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/16,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22</a>]. Nonlinearity of TSH measurements with serial dilution of the patient's serum strongly suggests assay interference. Addition of nonimmune homologous mouse immunoglobulins has reduced this type of assay interference. Commercial assays exist for detecting human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).</p><p>In addition, autoantibodies to TSH have also been described which create TSH-anti-TSH immunoglobulin G (IgG) complexes (also called macro-TSH), which lack biologic activity but may be immunoreactive and cause spuriously high TSH values (often &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tsh-secreting-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Autoantibodies to TSH can be detected by removal of the IgG-TSH complexes with polyethylene glycol or protein A or G, then repeating the assay on the immunosubtracted sera.</p><p>Patients with substances interfering with TSH measurements are usually euthyroid, not thyrotoxic, and have normal free T4 and T3.

Patients with RTH have variable tissue hyporesponsiveness to thyroid hormone due to a defect in the thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-beta gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tsh-secreting-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Despite their RTH in many tissues (including the pituitary gland), some patients with RTH have symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism, particularly tachycardia, hyperactivity, and hyperreflexia, and many have goiter.

The hyperplasia may be mistaken for a pituitary tumor, but the patients have clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism, low serum T4 and T3 concentrations, and very high serum TSH concentrations. These patients should not be confused with patients with TSH-secreting adenomas. The enlarged pituitary in hypothyroidism shrinks with T4 therapy.

In patients with these thyroid function tests, we perform a combination of tests to confirm the diagnosis as there is no single test that will absolutely diagnose this condition:</p><p>Initial assessment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask the patient to question other family members regarding abnormal thyroid function tests. Take a careful history for other potential pituitary abnormalities (eg, does the patient have amenorrhea or a visual field defect?).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat the thyroid tests in another lab (TSH, free T4 and T3). Assay interference is frequently dependent on the commercial kit used for measuring the hormone. Another strategy is to ask the original lab to assay the serum TSH in serial dilution; authentic TSH will dilute in parallel with the serial dilutions (eg, a serum TSH of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> will be 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> when the serum is diluted 1:2).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure alpha subunit, as approximately 50 to 85 percent of patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas have high serum concentrations. A normal level makes the diagnosis less likely but does not exclude it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure serum SHBG. A normal value is evidence that the patient is <strong>not</strong> hyperthyroid and argues for RTH or spuriously elevated TSH values.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure other pituitary hormones. Approximately 20 to 25 percent of the adenomas secrete one or more other pituitary hormones, predominantly growth hormone or prolactin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tsh-secreting-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Therefore, we measure insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and prolactin in patients with suspected TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas. Additionally, the presence of other hormonal deficiencies suggests the possibility of a possible sellar mass (eg, measure follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] in a postmenopausal woman, testosterone in a young man, etc).</p><p/><p>Subsequent assessment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of any history or testing suggestive of a pituitary adenoma, given the difficulty in distinguishing patients with TSH-secreting tumors from RTH, we perform an analysis for mutations in the TR-beta gene in patients with elevated free T4, T3, and nonsuppressed TSH and normal serum alpha subunit. In some countries, including the United States, this is now a rather widely available test. Although 15 percent of patients with RTH do not have mutations in the TR-beta, the presence of a mutation rules out the diagnosis of a TSH-secreting tumor (see <a href=\"#H1440208\" class=\"local\">'Resistance to thyroid hormone'</a> above) and may prevent the possible confounding discovery of a pituitary incidentaloma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the presence of history or testing suggestive of a pituitary adenoma, or after exclusion of RTH, we obtain an MRI of the pituitary with gadolinium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of a macroadenoma on MRI is strong evidence of a TSH-secreting tumor, particularly in the presence of an elevated alpha subunit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of a microadenoma on MRI is not specific for a TSH-secreting tumor and can be seen as an incidental finding in 10 percent of normal individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tsh-secreting-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Conversely, small pituitary tumors can be missed by MRI or computed tomography (CT).

Long-term antithyroid drug therapy or thyroid ablation with radioiodine or surgery is <strong>not</strong> indicated in patients with TSH-secreting adenomas, because sustained reductions in thyroid hormone secretion would be expected to increase TSH secretion and stimulate tumor growth. However, if euthyroidism cannot be achieved with somatostatin analogs or dopamine agonists, short-term administration of a thionamide is necessary to restore euthyroidism prior to neurosurgery. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonthyroid-surgery-in-the-patient-with-thyroid-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonthyroid surgery in the patient with thyroid disease&quot;, section on 'Hyperthyroidism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no well-established criteria for cure after transsphenoidal surgery. The parameters that should be taken into account when assessing for cure include clinical remission of symptoms of hyperthyroidism, normalization of thyroid function tests, and absence of residual tumor on MRI. (See <a href=\"#H366007\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for cure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with residual disease after transsphenoidal surgery, we prefer to treat with somatostatin analogs rather than pituitary irradiation due to the more immediate response with medication. The choice between long-term somatostatin analogs and pituitary radiation is based upon discussion with the individual patient about the risks and benefits of each therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1981389\" class=\"local\">'Residual disease'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tsh-secreting-pituitary-adenomas/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">&Oacute;nnestam L, Berinder K, Burman P, et al.
