In patients with systemic malignancies, brain metastases occur in 10 to 30 percent of adults and 6 to 10 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>The incidence of brain metastases may be increasing, due to both improved detection of small metastases by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and better control of extracerebral disease resulting from improved systemic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>].</p><p>The etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain metastases will be reviewed here, along with an overview of the approach to treatment. Specific treatment approaches to good and poor risk patients, as well as the use of systemic therapy, are discussed separately.

By contrast, carcinomas of the prostate, esophagus, and oropharynx and non-melanoma skin cancers rarely metastasize to the brain. In children, the most common sources of brain metastases are sarcomas, neuroblastoma, and germ cell tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>].</p><p>For all types of cancer, brain metastases diagnosed during life are relatively uncommon. This was illustrated in two large series, one from the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System and the other from a Dutch series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In both studies, the cumulative incidence of brain metastases detected was similar:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung &ndash; 16 to 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanoma &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal cell cancer &ndash; 7 to 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast cancer &ndash; 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colorectal cancer &ndash; 1 to 2 percent</p><p/><p>In autopsy series, the reported incidence of brain metastases varies widely, but is generally substantially higher than that diagnosed antemortem. This is illustrated by a review that found that brain metastases occur in as many as 64 percent of patients dying from lung cancer and 21 percent of those dying from breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Increasing incidence with advances in systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increases in the incidence of brain metastasis have been reported in several solid tumors, thought to be related, at least in part, to advances in the efficacy of systemic therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast cancer &ndash; Among women with breast cancer, the incidence of brain metastasis may be increasing and is particularly high in those with lung metastases and those with highly-proliferative, hormone receptor-negative tumors that are positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. In one series, 15 of 50 patients (30 percent) presenting with lung metastases as the first site of relapse subsequently developed brain metastases during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although tumor biology might also be at least partly responsible (ie, HER2-positive breast cancers have a higher propensity for metastases to sites such as lung and brain), it is also postulated that the lack of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> penetration into the central nervous system (CNS), owing to its high molecular weight, coupled with prolonged control of what was previously rapidly lethal systemic disease, leads to &quot;unmasking&quot; of brain metastases that would otherwise have remained clinically silent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-brain-metastases-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of brain metastases in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colorectal cancer &ndash; The increasing incidence of brain metastases in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer has been attributed to the longer survival seen with newer systemic therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/9,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,20,21</a>]. Compared with the era when 5-fluorouracil was the primary agent for metastatic disease, median survival has increased markedly with the introduction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, and biologics (from 6 to 7 to approximately 24 months).

Brain metastases are usually a late-stage phenomenon, and the vast majority of patients have metastases in other sites, particularly lung. Outcomes are poor, despite aggressive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) &ndash; The increasing incidence of brain metastases in patients with NSCLC is thought to be related, at least in part, to improved diagnosis of brain metastases with newer imaging modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Metastases are usually located directly at the junction of the gray matter and white matter where blood vessels decrease in diameter and act as a trap for clumps of tumor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Brain metastases also tend to be more common at the terminal &quot;watershed areas&quot; of arterial circulation. The distribution of metastases roughly follows the relative weight and blood flow in each area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral hemispheres &ndash; approximately 80 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebellum &ndash; 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brainstem &ndash; 5 percent</p><p/><p>Different primary tumors may have a predilection for metastasis to different areas within the brain. For example, pelvic (prostatic and uterine), gastrointestinal, and breast tumors more commonly metastasize to the posterior fossa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], while metastases of small cell carcinoma of the lung are equally distributed in all regions of the brain. The reasons for these differences are unclear but may be due to cell surface properties of the metastatic cells and the endothelium within the central nervous system (CNS) vasculature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain metastases have highly variable clinical features and should be suspected in any cancer patient who develops neurologic symptoms or behavioral abnormalities. However, multiple other causes can also be responsible. In an analysis of over 800 cancer patients evaluated for neurologic symptoms, only 16 percent had brain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In the majority of patients, a gradually expanding tumor mass and its associated edema cause symptoms. Less commonly, intratumoral hemorrhage, obstructive hydrocephalus, or embolization by tumor cells result in symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headaches occur in approximately 40 to 50 percent of patients with brain metastases. The frequency is higher when multiple lesions are present or a metastasis is located in the posterior fossa. Although the classic early morning headache is uncommon, it is highly suggestive when present.</p><p>These general features were illustrated in a review of 111 consecutive patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors identified by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Headache was present in 48 percent and equally affected those with primary and metastatic tumors. The headaches were similar to tension type in 77 percent, migraine in 9 percent, and other types in 14 percent. The typical headache was bifrontal but worse ipsilaterally; it was the worst symptom in approximately one-half of patients. In contrast to tension type headaches, brain tumor headaches were worse with bending over in 32 percent, and nausea or vomiting was present in 40 percent. Worsening headache may also follow maneuvers that raise intrathoracic pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or the Valsalva maneuver. The &quot;classic&quot; early morning brain tumor headache was uncommon.</p><p>Features suggestive of a possible brain tumor in the patient complaining of headaches include nausea and vomiting, a change in prior headache pattern, an abnormal neurologic examination, and positional worsening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brain-tumor-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brain tumor headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal neurologic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal neurologic dysfunction is the presenting symptom of 20 to 40 percent of patients. Hemiparesis is the most common complaint but the manifestations depend upon the location of the metastases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive dysfunction, including memory problems and mood or personality changes, is the presenting problem in 30 to 35 percent of patients. However, metabolic encephalopathy is a much more common cause of cognitive dysfunction than metastatic disease in cancer patients who develop an altered mental status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>New onset of seizures is the presenting symptom in 10 to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. Seizures in patients with brain metastases are almost exclusively associated with supratentorial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another 5 to 10 percent present acutely due to stroke caused by hemorrhage into a metastasis, hypercoagulability, invasion or compression of an artery by tumor, or embolization of tumor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/7,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,35</a>]. Melanoma, choriocarcinoma, and thyroid and renal carcinoma have a particular propensity to bleed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain metastases must be distinguished from primary brain tumors, infectious processes, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, demyelination, paraneoplastic phenomena, cerebral infarction or bleeding, and effects of treatment such as radiation necrosis.</p><p>Imaging studies provide useful information but brain biopsy is necessary in some cases for a definitive diagnosis. Other important diagnostic issues include determining the number and location of metastases and the evaluation of the patient without a known primary tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging study for the diagnosis of brain metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56550\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56550 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. Contrast-enhanced MRI is more sensitive than either nonenhanced MRI or computed tomography (CT) scanning in detecting lesions in patients suspected of having cerebral metastases and in differentiating metastases from other central nervous system (CNS) lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In one report of 23 patients, for example, contrast-enhanced MRI demonstrated more than 67 definite or typical parenchymal metastases compared with more than 40 with T2-weighted MRI and 37 with double-dose contrast-enhanced CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Radiographic features that can help differentiate brain metastases from other CNS lesions include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of multiple lesions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localization at the junction of the grey and white matter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumscribed margins</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large amounts of vasogenic edema compared with the size of the lesion</p><p/><p>Experimental techniques such as magnetization transfer (MT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>] and triple dose gadolinium imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>] have further improved lesion detection with MRI. In one study of 52 patients, for example, MT imaging showed more metastases than gradient-echo T1-weighted images in 23 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Newer modalities such as echo planar imaging, spectroscopy, positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), also may prove to be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. They are mainly used to differentiate tumor from radiation necrosis rather than for the initial diagnosis of brain metastases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsy should be performed when the diagnosis of brain metastases is in doubt. This is particularly important in patients with a single lesion. The importance of biopsy was demonstrated in a study in which the diagnosis of metastasis was changed by biopsy in 6 of 54 patients with a single lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. These six patients had primary brain tumors, infections, or inflammatory processes.</p><p>Breast cancer patients with a single dural-based lesion pose a particular diagnostic dilemma, since the incidence of meningiomas is increased in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Imaging studies are often inconclusive, but the presence of edema in the underlying brain and an irregular margin of the lesion may suggest a dural metastasis instead of a meningioma. However, biopsy or surgical resection of the lesion may be required to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meningioma#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Unknown primary tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In approximately 80 percent of patients, brain metastases develop after the diagnosis of systemic cancer (metachronous presentation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the remaining patients, brain metastases become evident either at the same time (synchronous presentation) or before the primary tumor is found (precocious presentation). In these situations, histopathology of the biopsy specimen, including immunohistochemistry, can often help identify the primary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Lung cancer is the most common cancer type associated with a synchronous presentation of brain and systemic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. </p><p>For patients who present with biopsy-proven brain metastases without a known primary tumor, the lung should be the primary focus of the evaluation. Over 60 percent of such patients have a primary lung cancer or pulmonary metastases from a primary tumor located elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. Other relatively frequent sites include melanoma and colon cancer, while the primary remains unknown in approximately 25 to 30 percent of cases.

In the others, a chest radiograph should be the first imaging test obtained. If this is nondiagnostic, a chest CT scan should be performed since this significantly increases the likelihood of detecting a lung tumor. This was illustrated in a report of 31 patients who presented with brain metastases without a known primary and subsequently were determined to have primary lung cancer by CT scan; chest radiographs were positive in only 19 (59 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. These patients should also have a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and a bone scan to determine the extent of metastatic disease.</p><p>PET may also be useful in these patients, either by identifying the primary tumor or by finding other sites of metastatic disease that can be biopsied more readily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Number of metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a single or limited number of small metastases should be differentiated from those with more extensive involvement since treatment may be different. Although earlier studies based upon CT scans suggested that as many as 50 percent of patients had a single metastasis, MRI suggests that the true frequency of single metastases is lower, accounting for only one-fourth to one-third of patients with cerebral metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases/abstract/6,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,36,37</a>].
