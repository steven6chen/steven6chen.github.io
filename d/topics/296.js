Antibiotics active against <em>P. aeruginosa</em> should be included in the empiric regimen if the child has a history of recurrent AOM or has received antibiotics recently.</p><p>In a child with either no previous history of AOM or a history of a remote episode (ie, &gt;6 months before), empiric antimicrobial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> alone (60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day divided every 6 hours with a maximum dose of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">gm/day)</span> will suffice as empiric treatment until microbiologic results are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61644 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>For children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media (most recent episode within six months) or recent antibiotic use, adequate coverage for gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens usually entails combination therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61644 \">table 1</a>). Additional antimicrobial agents may be warranted in patients with specific complications (eg, brain abscess) or if Gram stain of aspirated material demonstrates an unexpected finding. Antimicrobial therapy is adjusted as necessary when results of culture and susceptibility tests are available.</p><p>Upon diagnosis of the acute mastoiditis, initial antimicrobial typically is given intravenously.

It is subdivided according to the pathologic stage (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mastoiditis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mastoiditis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute mastoiditis with periosteitis &ndash; Purulent material in the mastoid cavities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coalescent mastoiditis &ndash; Destruction of the thin bony septae between air cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bacterial species most often implicated in acute mastoiditis are <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>is a consideration for children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) or recent antibiotic use. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consultation with specialty services (otolaryngology, neurosurgery as indicated) is warranted for children with clinical or radiographic evidence of complications or mastoid air cell coalescence on imaging studies. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Referral indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of acute mastoiditis depends upon the pathologic stage and presence or absence and type of complications. Antimicrobial therapy and drainage of the middle ear and mastoid are the cornerstones of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that uncomplicated mastoiditis or masked mastoiditis without intracranial complications be treated with intravenous (IV) antimicrobial therapy and myringotomy with or without placement of a tympanostomy tube (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that acute mastoiditis complicated by isolated facial nerve palsy be treated initially with IV antimicrobial therapy and myringotomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Complicated disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that children with complications of acute mastoiditis other than facial nerve palsy be treated with IV antimicrobial therapy, myringotomy and mastoidectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Complicated disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric antimicrobial therapy for children with acute mastoiditis without a history of recurrent AOM or recent antibiotic administration should provide coverage for the most frequent bacterial pathogens: <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>S. pyogenes</em>, and <em>S. aureus</em>. Antibiotics active against <em>P. aeruginosa</em> should be included in the empiric regimen if the child has a history of recurrent AOM or has received antibiotics recently. Suggested regimens are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61644 \">table 1</a>). Antimicrobial therapy is adjusted as necessary when results of culture and susceptibility tests are available. The total duration of antimicrobial therapy is four weeks. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of acute mastoiditis requires the drainage of pus from the middle ear <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mastoid cavity. The drainage procedure (tympanocentesis, myringotomy with or without placement of tympanostomy tube, mastoidectomy) varies depending upon the pathologic stage and the presence or absence and type of complications. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Drainage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children with acute mastoiditis that is appropriately treated early in the course recover without complications or long-term sequelae (eg, hearing loss).
