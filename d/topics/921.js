Thus, blood pressure is more accurately monitored in the left arm.

As with minimally invasive approaches, possible complications include vascular injury, tracheal or esophageal injury, or pneumothorax.</p><p>An open thoracotomy may be selected for an anterior mediastinal mass that is completely contained within one side of the chest. Intubation with a double-lumen endotracheal tube or a bronchial blocker is performed to achieve single-lung ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most anterior mediastinal masses that cross the midline require a sternotomy, usually a standard median sternotomy. If the mass extends into the chest on one side only, a hemi-clamshell incision may provide adequate exposure for complete resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90498\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90498 \">figure 6</a>). If the mass extends below the pulmonary hila on both sides, a clamshell incision is usually selected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90511\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90511 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p>Occasionally, a patient receives a large incision for a short procedure that turns out to be only exploratory. Anesthetic management of the patient must be planned so that the patient can either be rapidly awakened after a short procedure (eg, initial use of short-acting agents) or safely managed for a prolonged procedure (eg, adequate vascular access, appropriate hemodynamic monitoring, fastidious positioning and padding, and temperature control).</p><p>In cases with large incisions, postoperative pain control is an important consideration. In cooperative patients who will have a large incision, we use epidural analgesia to achieve postoperative pain control if there are no contraindications (see <a href=\"#H934102898\" class=\"local\">'Planned epidural analgesia'</a> below). For unilateral procedures (eg, thoracotomy), paravertebral block on the side of the surgery is a good alternative to epidural analgesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3399985515\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC PREPARATION AND MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H934103790\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If bleeding risk is high (eg, a large mass adjacent or adherent to vital structures), we obtain at least two large-bore peripheral catheters <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> large-bore central venous access. These factors also determine optimal sites for venous access and whether it is prudent to ensure central access before initiating induction of anesthesia.</p><p>A mass effect on certain branches of the venous vasculature may result in partial or full occlusion of venous drainage in the upper body, which may render central access useless at a compromised location. For example, if jugular and upper extremity venous engorgement is present in a patient with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, there is a high likelihood that upper caval flow is completely occluded and that induction of general anesthesia will cause cardiovascular collapse. In such cases, we insert catheters that drain into the inferior vena cava (IVC) <strong>prior to </strong>induction of anesthesia. We typically use either two large-bore peripheral catheters in the lower extremities or a single large-bore catheter in a femoral vein. In patients with difficult peripheral vascular access, dual central venous catheters may be placed, with one catheter draining into the SVC and the other draining into the IVC. Thus, the IVC catheter would be used during surgery until mass resection is complete and then subsequently discontinued, while the SVC catheter would be used in the postoperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H981289819\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood availability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Availability of blood products, as well as rapid infusion devices, should be ensured for patients with a large mediastinal mass in a critical location. Other preparations include preoperative communication with the surgeon regarding estimates of potential blood loss, as well as communication with the blood bank if massive transfusion is a possibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H934102898\"><span class=\"h2\">Planned epidural analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If epidural analgesia is planned for postoperative pain management (eg, for thoracotomy, sternotomy, or clamshell incision) (see <a href=\"#H267436313\" class=\"local\">'Open approaches (thoracotomy, sternotomy, thoracosternotomy)'</a> above), placement should be accomplished before induction of anesthesia.</p><p>We avoid the possibility of inducing a sympathectomy in a patient who might develop hypotension during anesthetic induction or during the surgical procedure itself. Thus, we use conservative epidural test doses of a local anesthetic agent. Although we administer epidural opioids prior to surgical incision to provide supplemental analgesia, we avoid full activation of the epidural (eg, bolus dosing with a local anesthetic agent or initiation of local anesthetic infusion) until the mass has been resected and the patient is hemodynamically stable.

However, the superior area of the sternal incision may not be adequately covered, and supplemental analgesia may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-with-an-anterior-mediastinal-mass/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Having a &quot;standby&quot; CPB team is usually futile in such situations because the time required to cannulate major blood vessels and initiate bypass is at least 10 minutes. Thus, if the size <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> location of the mass raise suspicion for the possibility of complete obstruction of the airway or major blood vessels during anesthetic induction, the surgical team may insert the necessary cannulas for femoral vein-to-femoral artery CPB or, very rarely, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In these cases, CPB or ECMO may be initiated before induction of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-patients-with-an-anterior-mediastinal-mass/abstract/1,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,14</a>].

After the airway has been secured, airway pressure and volume are monitored.

For example, patients with facial, upper extremity, or vocal cord edema due to SVC syndrome have a high likelihood of airway collapse and obstruction during induction of general anesthesia. In such cases, awake intubation using flexible bronchoscopy is performed, with the patient breathing spontaneously, <strong>prior to</strong> induction of general anesthesia.

Visualization with flexible bronchoscopy provides real-time information that may have been missed by radiographic evaluation, including dynamic airway collapse due to induction of anesthesia, mass effects, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> changes that occur during positioning. Typically, if flexible bronchoscopy is planned immediately after induction, a supraglottic airway device is placed to serve as a conduit for the bronchoscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Also, direct visualization with flexible bronchoscopy may be employed in order to properly position a specialized ETT. For example:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Reinforced ETT</strong> &ndash; If examination with flexible bronchoscopy reveals that the trachea is significantly compressed, then a reinforced ETT with less collapsibility and more flexibility is typically preferred, rather than a standard ETT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Long ETT</strong> &ndash; If the compressed portion of the trachea is either significant in length or is distally located, a longer tube may be required (eg, a MLT or a DLT).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Maintenance of spontaneous ventilation during induction</strong> &ndash; In patients with SVC syndrome, as noted above, spontaneous ventilation may be maintained throughout induction of anesthesia by employing an inhalational anesthetic induction technique, due to the high risk of cardiovascular collapse during positive pressure ventilation. We continue to maintain spontaneous ventilation after intubation of the trachea if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable in order to avoid the reduction in preload that occurs with positive pressure ventilation. Rarely, preservation of spontaneous ventilation must be maintained until after surgical control of the mass has been accomplished or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been established for control of oxygenation and ventilation.

Possible intraoperative problems include shifting of the mass effect due to surgical compression, surgical trauma (eg, inadvertent breach of the airway), airway collapse due to tracheomalacia, malposition of the ETT, or development of high airway pressure during positive pressure ventilation. Techniques to manage these problems include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring with direct visualization via flexible bronchoscopy</strong> &ndash; If the patient develops respiratory compromise, intraoperative flexible bronchoscopy may be used to visualize the internal airway conduit, thus allowing rapid diagnosis and correction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cross-field ventilation </strong>&ndash; In some cases, cross-field ventilation is required. Examples include planned resection of the trachea (eg, tumor that is adherent to the trachea and cannot be &quot;peeled off&quot;) or inadvertent tracheal injury resulting in unplanned resection. In such cases, the surgeon directly intubates the main conducting airway distal to the affected tracheal area and connects the ETT to the breathing circuit tubing (or to a jet ventilator apparatus and tubing). The proximal end of such tubing (with extensions) is passed over the surgical drapes to the anesthesiologist to be immediately connected to the anesthesia machine (or to an oxygen supply for jet ventilation). This cross-field ventilation technique will ensure continued oxygenation and ventilation in a patient with breached airway anatomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In such cases, volatile anesthetics should be discontinued to avoid inhalation by the surgical team, and total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) should be instituted to ensure adequate anesthetic depth. Also, to reduce the risk of airway fire, the anesthesiologist discontinues <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> and reduces FiO<sub>2</sub> to &lt;30 percent or the minimum level required to avoid hypoxia. Adequate time should be allowed for reduction of both the fraction of <strong>inspired</strong> oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) and the fraction of <strong>expired</strong> oxygen (FeO<sub>2</sub>) to this safe level (&lt;30 percent) before the surgeon uses electrosurgery or any other ignition source.

If there is a high likelihood of vascular occlusion in one upper extremity, we place intraarterial catheters in both upper extremities (ie, radial and axillary).

We accomplish this either by temporarily increasing the concentration of volatile anesthetic agent or by temporarily infusing rapid-acting IV agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=remifentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">remifentanil</a> 0.1 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute,</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> 50 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/minute,</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a> 0.2 to 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/hour)</span>.

The double lumen tube can be replaced with a single lumen tube by using a tube exchanger. The patient remains intubated with controlled ventilation until extubation is safe.

The anesthesia care team must have a high index of suspicion for these events since they typically occur in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Also, the team must have capabilities for rapid intervention (eg, advanced airway control or massive transfusion) and available anesthesia personnel for a possible emergency return to the operating room.
