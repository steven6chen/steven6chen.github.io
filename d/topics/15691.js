Advances in understanding the genetics, pathophysiology, and natural history of the disease since its initial description in the early 1960s have made the importance of accurate diagnosis and management of this disorder more compelling.</p><p>This topic review discusses the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and clinical management of SDS.</p><p>Other inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, and an approach to the evaluation of patients with bone marrow failure, are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aplastic anemia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired aplastic anemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-idiopathic-severe-aplastic-anemia-and-fanconi-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for idiopathic severe aplastic anemia and Fanconi anemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dyskeratosis congenita and other short telomere syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-diamond-blackfan-anemia-and-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for Diamond-Blackfan anemia and the myelodysplastic syndromes in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): Specific defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) (<a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/260400&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S9z+Obqn2GffYYfTAYQtRPDEt8pwRBUd8fqSuA+NnqUfR&amp;TOPIC_ID=5914\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">OMIM #260400</a>) was initially described as a clinical syndrome in the 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Subsequent studies identified mutations in the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (<em>SBDS</em>) gene (<a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/607444&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S9+kOaTxqZ7hgoL07BXslEDOqNzAZ6bum7MZQPHMNVT7/&amp;TOPIC_ID=5914\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">OMIM 607444</a>) in over 90 percent of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Genetic defects have not been identified in the remaining 10 percent of clinically diagnosed individuals who appear to have normal expression of the <em>SBDS</em> gene product.</p><p>Transmission of SDS is autosomal recessive. Affected individuals are either homozygous or compound heterozygous for a <em>SBDS</em> mutation. Many of these mutations appear to result from gene conversion between <em>SBDS</em> and an adjacent, nonfunctional pseudogene with similar sequence to <em>SBDS</em>, which results in recombination between portions of <em>SBDS</em> and the pseudogene that impair gene function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other studies have shown point mutations including missense and nonsense mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Specific genotype-phenotype correlations have not been identified to predict disease severity or the likelihood of specific disease manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>The <em>SBDS</em> gene is highly conserved throughout evolution and is expressed in all human tissues tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/5,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,15</a>]. In a mouse model, homozygous deletion (knockout) of <em>SBDS</em> is lethal during embryogenesis, consistent with a fundamental role for <em>SBDS</em> in early development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The SBDS protein has been implicated in ribosome biogenesis and mitotic spindle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/5,14,15,17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,15,17-22</a>]. Studies in various model systems have revealed important roles in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit and ribosome assembly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/20,23-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23-30</a>]. Other studies have suggested roles in controlling an array of seemingly unrelated cellular processes including mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species, normal ploidy, extracellular protease levels, stress response, chemotaxis, and brain development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/19,31-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,31-38</a>].</p><p>How these defects contribute to the clinical manifestations of SDS has not been established. Defects in maintaining cellular ploidy may contribute to the increased risk of leukemic transformation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of SDS is unknown. An estimated incidence of clinically affected individuals of approximately 1 in 77,000 was predicted from one series, but this may represent an underestimate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A population-based estimate from Italy suggests that the incidence of biallelic mutation positive patients with SDS is 1 in 168,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>SDS appears to be one of the more common inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. In a cohort of 259 patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, SDS accounted for 35 cases (14 percent), slightly less than Diamond-Blackfan anemia and Fanconi anemia (17 and 15 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Although SDS is an autosomal recessive disorder, there is a slightly increased incidence in males, resulting in a male to female ratio of 1.7:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. No specific racial or ethnic predilection has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SDS is characterized by a constellation of findings including cytopenias (classically neutropenia, but trilineage cytopenias with mild thrombocytopenia and macrocytic anemia are also common), exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and bony abnormalities including thoracic dystrophy with short stature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/10,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,44-46</a>]. Most patients present in infancy or early childhood, although later presentations have been reported. As noted below, the increasing use of genetic diagnosis has resulted in identification of individuals with more subtle findings, who may not have been included in earlier reports describing the clinical manifestations of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Presenting findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classical presentation is an infant or young child with steatorrhea, neutropenia or recurrent infections, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> growth retardation. This is helpful when present but may not always be seen. Typical presenting findings may differ depending on how patients are diagnosed. Individuals diagnosed based on clinical features are more likely to have an early age of presentation and more severe features; in contrast, some patients diagnosed by genetic testing may have had only mild clinical manifestations. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic diagnosis</strong> &ndash; A report from the North American Shwachman-Diamond Registry that included 37 patients with a diagnosis confirmed by <em>SBDS</em> gene analysis reported a slightly older median patient age at presentation (3.5 years) and more subtle clinical findings (eg, isolated diarrhea, isolated neutropenia, isolated thrombocytopenia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The incidence of diarrhea was also lower (58 percent), and two individuals (5 percent) were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. A subsequent update with 83 patients, 64 percent with biallelic <em>SBDS</em> mutations, demonstrated an older median age at diagnosis (11.1 years) and more heterogeneous clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Cytopenias, particularly intermittent neutropenia, were seen in all patients. These and other studies have also reported additional findings upon presentation including frequent infections, tooth enamel defects, cleft palate, and neurocognitive dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,50-53</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical diagnosis</strong> &ndash; In one of the larger case series, which included 129 patients in 116 families who were diagnosed clinically, before the wide availability of genetic testing, the median age at diagnosis was one year, with a range from 0.1 to 13 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The distribution of clinical findings included the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Steatorrhea &ndash; 86 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neutropenia &ndash; 98 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum hepatic aminotransferase abnormalities &ndash; 60 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skeletal abnormalities &ndash; 49 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Short stature &ndash; 56 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anemia &ndash; 42 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thrombocytopenia &ndash; 34 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pancytopenia &ndash; 19 percent</p><p/><p>The availability of genetic diagnosis has made it clear that many clinical features may be mild or absent in affected patients. As with many of the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, clinical manifestations are highly variable and genetic testing of all individuals at risk for SDS (particularly normal-appearing siblings of patients) should be performed, as patients with SDS benefit from cancer screening to allow early detection. (See <a href=\"#H65572\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing and monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical findings are discussed in more detail in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutropenia/bone marrow failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SDS demonstrate varying degrees of bone marrow failure, generally occurring at an early age. Isolated neutropenia, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, macrocytic anemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pancytopenia have been reported. There are reports of patients with SDS presenting with aplastic anemia at birth, and of development of hematologic abnormalities later in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> is the most common hematologic finding in SDS. In a cohort of patients with SDS diagnosed clinically (before the availability of genetic testing), 98 percent had neutropenia, which was intermittent in approximately two-thirds and persistent in approximately one-third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In the North American Registry series, diagnosis confirmed by genetic testing, neutropenia was seen at some point in the course in only 19 (51 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Abnormalities in neutrophil chemotaxis have also been reported; however, oxidative activity and phagocytosis appear to be unaffected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/11,32,33,55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,32,33,55-58</a>]. Thus, patients&rsquo; increased risk of infection related to both decreased neutrophil number <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function.</p><p>Anemia has also been reported in SDS; the reticulocyte count typically is inappropriately low and the cells are normocytic or macrocytic. In the cohort of patients with SDS diagnosed clinically, 42 percent had anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In the North American Registry series (diagnosis confirmed by genetic testing), anemia was seen in 7 percent; in three patients (half of those with anemia), anemia was severe enough to require transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>Thrombocytopenia has been reported in SDS, although severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding are rare in the absence of progression to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (see <a href=\"#H64848\" class=\"local\">'Myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia'</a> below). In the cohort of patients with SDS diagnosed clinically, 34 percent had thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In the North American Registry series (diagnosis confirmed by genetic testing), 27 percent had thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>The mechanism(s) of bone marrow failure in SDS is incompletely understood. In one series in which 40 patients with SDS had a bone marrow evaluation performed, findings included hypocellularity in 24 (60 percent), maturation <span class=\"nowrap\">delay/arrest</span> in 12 (30 percent), cytogenetic abnormalities in six (15 percent), granulocyte hypoplasia in four (10 percent), myelodysplasia in four (10 percent), granulocyte hyperplasia in three (8 percent), and erythroid hypoplasia in two (5 percent); only six were reported as normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The management of bone marrow failure is generally supportive. For some individuals, hematopoietic cell transplant may be appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Management of cytopenias and infection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H199948\" class=\"local\">'Role of hematopoietic cell transplant'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67828\"><span class=\"h2\">Pancreatic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SDS is the second most common cause of inherited exocrine pancreatic dysfunction after cystic fibrosis. Pancreatic dysfunction often presents with steatorrhea, which manifests as diarrhea with pale, greasy, voluminous, foul-smelling stools. In a cohort of patients with SDS diagnosed clinically, 86 percent had steatorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. More sensitive measures of pancreatic function (eg, low serum trypsinogen concentration) in the same cohort revealed pancreatic dysfunction in 91 percent. </p><p>In the North American Registry series of individuals diagnosed confirmed by genetic testing, 21 had diarrhea (58 percent); however, many without diarrhea had abnormalities on pancreatic imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In this series, fecal elastase was low in 14 of 17 individuals (82 percent), and all 17 had low serum trypsinogen or pancreatic isoamylase.</p><p>Of interest, pancreatic function often improves with age, in many cases to a level of sufficient function that allows discontinuation of enzyme replacement. In a series of 25 individuals with SDS and pancreatic insufficiency, 45 percent showed age-related improvements leading to pancreatic sufficiency, especially after four years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p>The mechanism of pancreatic dysfunction is unclear, although it appears that the defect involves pancreatic acinar aplasia and spares pancreatic endocrine function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Pancreatic imaging (eg, ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may show a variety of findings, including a small, shrunken pancreas, lipomatosis, or fatty replacement; pancreatic MRI is normal in others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74272\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74272 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,59</a>]. Pancreatic biopsy may reveal normal ductal architecture and islets of Langerhans but absent or few acinar cells that are replaced with fatty tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58390\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58390 \">picture 1</a>), but pathologic evaluation generally is not performed. </p><p>The need for pancreatic enzyme replacement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supplementation with fat soluble vitamins depends on the severity of the dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H66825\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic enzyme replacement and vitamin supplementation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Skeletal abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of skeletal abnormalities have been reported in SDS, including short stature, osteopenia, metaphyseal dysplasia, <span class=\"nowrap\">thoracic/rib</span> and pelvic dystrophies, short arms and legs, and duplicated distal thumb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42,48,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,48,60</a>]. Abnormalities in bone turnover may account for reduced bone mass in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Commonly involved sites include the ribs, femurs, knees, humeral heads, wrists, ankles, and vertebrae.</p><p>The frequency of skeletal abnormalities varies by report and may reflect the intensity of the evaluation. Skeletal abnormalities were seen in 43 of 88 patients diagnosed clinically (49 percent), and 14 of 37 patients diagnosed by genetic testing (38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,48</a>]. In a series of 10 individuals with SDS who underwent skeletal radiographic surveys, all had at least one abnormality, regardless of the presence of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>Short stature appears to be caused by skeletal abnormalities, although nutritional defects may also contribute in some cases. This conclusion is supported by the findings that many infants with SDS have decreased length at birth, and many children with short stature have proportional weight for height throughout childhood, despite pancreatic enzyme replacement and nutritional supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42,53,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,53,62</a>]. </p><p>Dental abnormalities including tooth and enamel malformation, in addition to the neutropenia-related gingival inflammation, are also common, although the mechanism is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Other findings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with SDS may be at increased risk for recurrent bacterial and viral infections. In a review of published cases that included 153 patients, common infections included pneumonia, recurrent otitis media, skin infections, and abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p>Mechanisms may include neutropenia, neutrophil dysfunction, and B or T cell dysfunction. This was illustrated in a series of 11 individuals with SDS, seven of whom had recurrent bacterial infections and six of whom had recurrent viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. All had neutropenia; nine had B cell defects (eg, low numbers of circulating B cells, low immunoglobulin levels, lack of specific antibody production); and seven had T cell abnormalities (eg, low numbers of circulating T cells, decreased in vitro T cell proliferation). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64848\"><span class=\"h2\">Myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with SDS are at increased risk for developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but estimates of the frequency vary widely.</p><p>In a report from the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry that included 55 patients with SDS, seven individuals had MDS or AML, with a variety of complex karyotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The cumulative risk of developing MDS or AML in individuals with SDS was estimated to be 19 percent at 20 years and 36 percent at 30 years; these risks were higher than estimated for other congenital neutropenia syndromes such as severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). </p><p>Other series reported myelodysplasia by bone marrow examination in 4 of 40 (10 percent) patients diagnosed with SDS clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and in 27 of 31 (87 percent) diagnosed by genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Common cytogenetic abnormalities include monosomy 7, isochromosome 7, and deletion of 20q. The progression of the MDS including cytogenetic abnormalities is uncertain, and multiple cases of disappearance of cytogenetic abnormalities have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. </p><p>Mutations of the tumor suppressor gene, <em>TP53</em>, may contribute to the development of MDS and AML in SDS. Exome sequencing of hematopoietic colonies from 27 children with SDS (median age six years) revealed clonal hematopoiesis associated with mutations in <em>TP53</em> in half of the patients, but in none of 17 healthy controls or 40 patients with SCN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Many of the children with SDS had multiple <em>TP53</em> mutations.</p><p>The prognosis is poor for patients with SDS who develop AML; thus, patients with MDS are monitored closely including with periodic bone marrow examinations regardless of blood counts. Hematopoietic cell transplantation should be discussed when clear evidence of progressive myelodysplasia is present and before AML develops. (See <a href=\"#H199948\" class=\"local\">'Role of hematopoietic cell transplant'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Other findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large number of other clinical manifestations have been described in individuals with SDS. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hepatic dysfunction</strong> &ndash; Hepatic abnormalities in SDS may include elevated serum transaminases, hepatomegaly, steatosis, and inflammation. In a cohort of 80 patients diagnosed clinically for whom transaminase values were available, 48 of 80 showed abnormal elevations (60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Hepatomegaly was seen in 13 of 88 individuals (15 percent). Liver biopsies showed histologic abnormalities in 12 of 13 cases (92 percent), including microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis; portal and periportal inflammation; and portal, periportal, and bridging fibrosis. In a series of 37 patients diagnosed by genetic testing, 15 had elevated transaminases (41 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similar to pancreatic dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction may improve during childhood. This was illustrated in a series of 12 individuals with SDS who had liver abnormalities; values normalized in many cases by five years of age, and no additional abnormalities developed during extended observation into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac findings</strong> &ndash; Cardiac anomalies and heart failure have been reported in SDS. In the North American Registry, 7 of 37 patients had congenital cardiac anomalies (19 percent), which included ventricular septal defect in three, patent foramen ovale in five, and patent ductus arteriosus in five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In a series of 14 patients who underwent echocardiography, ejection fraction was normal in all 14; however, 4 of 12 (33 percent) had evidence of circumferential strain, suggesting systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurocognitive and behavioral problems</strong> &ndash; Observations from case series have suggested that some patients with SDS can have learning and behavioral difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/52,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,70,71</a>]. One report compared the cognitive, behavioral, and adaptive functioning of 32 children with SDS with that of their unaffected siblings and a comparison group of children with cystic fibrosis, using standardized neuropsychological tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The children with SDS performed less well than the comparison groups on measures of intellectual reasoning, higher order language skills, perceptual reasoning, visual-motor processing, attention, and several other neuropsychological measures. Structural brain abnormalities have been noted on imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Developmental anomalies</strong> &ndash; A variety of other developmental anomalies have been reported in individuals with SDS, including abnormalities of the urinary tract, cleft palate, intestinal malrotation, imperforate anus, eye and ear anomalies, Chiari malformation, and cerebellar tonsillar ectopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/42,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dental dysplasia</strong> &ndash; Tooth enamel defects (hypomaturation, hypocalcification, and hypoplasia) are commonly seen in patients with SDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Dental caries and tooth surface loss are seen in approximately one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Gingivitis also occurs related to the degree of untreated neutropenia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endocrine abnormalities &ndash; </strong>In contrast, endocrine abnormalities do not appear to be a major finding in SDS. Type I diabetes mellitus was reported to occur in 2 of 62 patients in the Italian national registry for SDS (approximately 3 percent), which is low overall but higher than expected for the reference population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In a series of 43 individuals with SDS who underwent directed endocrine evaluations, various endocrine abnormalities were identified in a small number of patients, but no consistent clinically relevant abnormalities were identified. In the 25 patients with gene mutations in this report, two had low stimulated growth hormone levels, two had elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels, and five had abnormal glucose levels on formal oral glucose tolerance tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p>Non-hematopoietic malignancies also do not appear to be a major clinical feature of SDS, although there are single case reports of breast cancer in a 30 year old, dermatofibrosarcoma in a 17 year old, diffuse large B cell lymphoma of brain in an 18 year old, and possible Hodgkin lymphoma in one of the original reports of the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/2,74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,74-76</a>].

SDS should be suspected in an infant with growth failure, feeding difficulties, steatorrhea, neutropenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Often, however, SDS will be considered by various subspecialists in the context of an evaluation for unexplained cytopenias (hematology), steatorrhea or failure to thrive (gastroenterology), or poor linear growth (endocrinology). </p><p>SDS is more likely to be considered in the diagnosis of individuals with a known family history of the disorder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a classic presentation with <span class=\"nowrap\">neutropenia/bone</span> marrow failure and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. However, some individuals may have intermittent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subclinical abnormalities in hematopoiesis or pancreatic function, making clinical diagnosis more challenging. </p><p>Evaluation for SDS includes a thorough patient history for infections, bleeding, growth (including plotting growth history and percentiles), and gastrointestinal symptoms, especially steatorrhea. A potential family history of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, fetal or early childhood sibling deaths, and the possibility of consanguinity, which would make the diagnosis of SDS more likely, should be assessed. However, as the North American Registry has reported, SDS occurs in patients with biallelic mutations and few clinical symptoms as well as those with clinical manifestations who lack known mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>The physical examination focuses on a thorough evaluation for congenital anomalies, organomegaly, and cardiac function. Abnormal findings should be pursued with appropriate diagnostic testing. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68528\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single test that is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of SDS; diagnosis is based on the constellation of clinical and laboratory features. Laboratory testing helpful at diagnosis includes a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet count, and testing for pancreatic dysfunction (eg, fecal elastase, serum trypsinogen in children &lt;3 years of age or pancreatic isoamylase in those &ge;3 years of age, serum lipase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Bone marrow evaluation with aspirate and biopsy is appropriate once the diagnosis has been established, or for the elimination of other bone marrow disorders.

However, 10 percent of patients with SDS lack an <em>SBDS</em> gene mutation. Thus, the absence of a <em>SBDS</em> mutation cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis of SDS if the clinical presentation is suggestive of the disease. </p><p>Resources for genetic testing including listings for laboratories that can provide this service are available on the Genetic Testing Registry (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4oottyJV+tPhS7Gs3UPQx+He7Xh4E9j4nqEtGCcPjsW+wBz&amp;TOPIC_ID=5914\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/</a>). </p><p>Genetic testing is also used to screen family members for familial mutation(s) that have been identified in an affected individual.

Clinical diagnosis is established by documenting abnormalities in bone marrow function and exocrine pancreatic function, and excluding other known causes of bone marrow failure and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Criteria based on consensus guidelines include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cytopenia of any hematopoietic lineage, which may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> on at least two occasions over two months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Other hypo-productive cytopenia (eg, anemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57465\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57465 \">table 1</a>) or thrombocytopenia [platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL])</span> on at least two occasions over two months </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pancreatic dysfunction, based on reduced levels of pancreatic enzymes adjusted to age, including one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Fecal elastase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Serum trypsinogen (age &lt;3 years)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Serum isoamylase (age &ge;3 years)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Serum lipase</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molecular (genetic) diagnosis</strong> &ndash; Molecular diagnosis is established by documenting biallelic (ie, homozygous or compound heterozygous) <em>SBDS</em> mutations known to be deleterious or predicted to be deleterious (eg, based on in vitro testing or modeling). This testing is confirmatory of a clinical diagnosis of SDS if positive and may allow early diagnosis of SDS before the full clinical spectrum of disease is present; however, negative testing does not eliminate the diagnosis of SDS.

Transmission may be autosomal or X-linked recessive. Like SDS, FA is characterized by bone marrow failure, short stature, congenital cardiac and bone anomalies, and FA has an even higher predisposition to hematologic malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Unlike SDS, FA typically presents during later childhood and is not associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Patients with FA frequently have congenital anomalies (eg, thumb and radial ray, renal), characteristic skin changes (eg, hypopigmentation, caf&eacute; au lait spots), and carcinomas (eg, head and neck, esophageal, hepatic, vulvar) that are not seen in SDS. Finally, laboratory testing in FA reveals increased sensitivity to chromosomal breakage from DNA crosslinking agents that is not observed in SDS. FA is discussed in detail separately. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dyskeratosis congenita (DC)</strong> &ndash; DC is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome caused by defective telomere maintenance; the classic presenting triad of DC includes skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia, but not all may be present. DC can be caused by one of many genetic defects, and its inheritance may be autosomal (OMIM #615190) or X-linked (OMIM #305000). Patients with DC usually are diagnosed in adolescence or adulthood, but symptomatic pediatric cases do occur. Like SDS, patients with DC have bone marrow failure that may result in myeloid malignancy (although the bone marrow problems in DC usually present later in life). Unlike SDS, individuals with DC may have characteristic skin and nail changes and a predisposition to other malignancies. DC is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dyskeratosis congenita and other short telomere syndromes&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT)</strong> &ndash; CAMT (<a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/604498&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S9+xB4Mx2YYl7033Nj/OjmKYaMKRsVFc7ehpWGsxvQUVX&amp;TOPIC_ID=5914\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">OMIM #604498</a>) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome associated with isolated thrombocytopenia that can progress to pancytopenia. CAMT is caused by mutation in the gene encoding the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor, which is required for production of megakaryocytes and platelets. Like SDS, CAMT can be associated with bone marrow failure. Unlike SDS, CAMT is not associated with exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, other congenital organ disorders, or other anomalies; genetic testing in CAMT reveals a mutation affecting the TPO receptor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cystic fibrosis (CF)</strong> &ndash; CF (<a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/219700&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S92EhjsTXEjZMJ/hQoPvgjEJES3d7Ir5p5FUSo99ylLUC&amp;TOPIC_ID=5914\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">OMIM #219700</a>) is an inherited condition associated with exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, chronic respiratory infections, and meconium ileus due to a mutation that affects exocrine glands in the pancreas, bronchi, and gastrointestinal tract. Like SDS, CF may present in infancy with malabsorption. Unlike SDS, patients with CF may have other manifestations related to glandular dysfunction including lung disease, biliary cirrhosis, and infertility; patients with CF do not have bone marrow failure. Unlike SDS, patients with CF have an abnormal sweat chloride test. Additional information about CF is presented in detail separately.

Pearson syndrome is caused by abnormalities in mitochondrial DNA, including large deletions or rearrangements, which cause pancytopenia, pancreatic insufficiency, lactic acidosis, and failure to thrive. Many patients with Pearson syndrome die in infancy. Like SDS, patients with Pearson syndrome present in infancy or early childhood with anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Unlike SDS, individuals with Pearson syndrome have bone marrow findings that include normal cellularity, ring sideroblasts, and vacuolization of bone marrow progenitors; pancreatic fibrosis rather than lipomatosis; the absence of bone lesions; and genetic testing reveals mitochondrial gene defects rather than <em>SBDS </em>mutations.

Like SDS, JBS can present in infancy with pancreatic insufficiency and abnormal growth, and inheritance of JBS is autosomal recessive. Unlike SDS, JBS is associated with a variety of other features including hypothyroidism, scalp defects, dental abnormalities, urogenital malformations, and imperforate anus; and genetic testing reveals mutation of the <em>UBR1</em> gene. JBS and an overview of other congenital causes of steatorrhea in infants and children are presented separately.

Management by a multidisciplinary team (eg, gastroenterologist and hematologist, with other subspecialists as clinically indicated) provides optimal care. For the most part, management is based on clinical experience and extrapolation from other disorders, as high quality evidence from randomized trials is lacking for this rare condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65572\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional testing and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SDS are at risk of a number of complications, and baseline testing and anticipatory monitoring is appropriate. Typically, once a diagnosis is made, patients are followed two to four times per year to evaluate their status. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Growth</strong> &ndash; Growth and development are monitored regularly, and treatable factors contributing to growth delay (eg, nutritional deficits, endocrine abnormalities) are corrected. Enzyme replacement and formula supplementation may be helpful to optimize growth. Involvement of a registered dietician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nutritionist may also be helpful. However, the number of visits such multi-expert care may require of families may be great, and the frequency of interventions must be tailored to the interests and ability of the patient and family to comply. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematologic monitoring and testing</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>CBC</strong> &ndash; Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet count is performed every three to six months, or more frequently if clinically indicated (eg, worsening pancytopenia, recurrent infections) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Some patients may have hypogammaglobulinemia as well. Patients with recurrent infections, even if low-grade or indolent, should be evaluated for these additional problems as clinically indicated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-recurrent-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with recurrent infections&quot;</a>). However, routine testing is not required. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Bone marrow</strong> &ndash; Generally, a bone marrow evaluation (aspirate and biopsy) is performed soon after the diagnosis, especially when any cytopenias are present, even if they are mild. Cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with SDS such as isochromosome 7 i(7)(q10) and deletion of the long arm of 20, del(20)(q11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>] should be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Patients with severe neutropenia may be treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Management of cytopenias and infection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Serial monitoring of the bone marrow with cytogenetics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> FISH is appropriate for patients with SDS for early detection of progressive aplasia, clonal disease, or malignant transformation, although the prognostic value of detection of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities (eg, isochromosome 7q) in the absence of pathologic changes consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The frequency of bone marrow testing depends on the degree of cytopenia, the rapidity of change, and whether G-CSF is required to maintain an acceptable ANC. In general, annual bone marrow evaluations are generally performed if the patient is receiving G-CSF or even more frequently if a clonal cytogenetic abnormality is present. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Management of cytopenias and infection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Unaffected family members who are heterozygous for a disease-causing mutation (ie, disease carriers) do not require a bone marrow or any further evaluation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pancreatic function</strong> &ndash; Initial evaluation of pancreatic exocrine function (eg, age-adjusted serum trypsinogen and pancreatic isoamylase; fecal elastase) is appropriate in all patients, as some may have subclinical deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In a cohort of 90 individuals with SDS compared with 134 unaffected controls, low serum trypsinogen levels in individuals &lt;3 years of age or low serum pancreatic isoamylase levels in those &gt;3 years of age were sensitive measures of pancreatic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If pancreatic dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> steatorrhea are present, these should be further characterized with a timed quantitative fecal fat measurement and levels of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K); and serum transaminase levels. Radiologic imaging may be appropriate for those with pancreatic dysfunction; however, imaging is not required. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ongoing monitoring of pancreatic exocrine function is performed in all patients to monitor the efficacy of enzyme replacement or to assess resolution or worsening of pancreatic dysfunction. Frequency of testing depends on prior deficits, use of pancreatic supplements, and symptoms. A trial off of supplements could be attempted during a school vacation in older children (eg, approximately 10 years of age or older), as many patients will have improvement of pancreatic function in later childhood. (See <a href=\"#H67828\" class=\"local\">'Pancreatic dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Repletion using vitamin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mineral supplements is similar to those with cystic fibrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues&quot;, section on 'Fat soluble vitamins'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dental evaluation</strong> &ndash; Referral to a dentist should occur at an early age (generally by age 3) because a significant number of patients have dental abnormalities (eg, enamel defects, increased risk of dental caries). Routine adherence to use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoride</a> toothpaste and avoidance of sugary snacks is also important (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-dental-care-and-counseling-for-infants-and-young-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive dental care and counseling for infants and young children&quot;</a>).

Patient and parent preference clearly must be taken into consideration as well. In the North American Registry, only 14 of 86 patients required chronic G-CSF administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shwachman-diamond-syndrome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>G-CSF may be used for treatment of a specific time-limited infection or started at the time of hospital admission for fever and neutropenia.

G-CSF may also be used chronically to reduce the risk of recurrent infections, fever and neutropenia, or gingivitis. When used chronically, G-CSF should be administered at the lowest possible dose and for the fewest number of days per week. Treatment usually starts at the standard dose of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> daily and is titrated to the fewest number of days per week (often two or three) that is adequate to maintain a nadir ANC &gt;800 to <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/microL</span>. &#160;</p><p>A bone marrow evaluation, including aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetics and FISH for informative abnormalities is recommended prior to the initiation of chronic G-CSF and is performed annually thereafter for concern of the development of MDS or AML.

For optimal planning, patients with SDS-associated MDS and those who require G-CSF to maintain their ANC above <span class=\"nowrap\">500/microL</span> are monitored with more frequent bone marrow examinations (at least annually) with cytogenetics and FISH. The goal is to perform HCT before the development of AML, although the optimal timing is unknown. </p><p>The optimal stem cell source and conditioning regimen for HCT in SDS are also unknown, and data on the outcome of HCT in individuals with SDS are limited. Toxicity from intensive conditioning regimens appears to be especially common in individuals with SDS, as it is in many inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.

Leukoreduced and irradiated blood products should be used in all patients with SDS from the time of diagnosis to reduce the risks of febrile reactions and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Irradiated blood products are used to minimize the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD) and provide the best risk reduction for viral reactivation in patients who may eventually need hematopoietic cell transplantation. Related donors should not be used for blood products, because of the possible need for HCT in the future and greater risk of graft rejection in individuals who have received blood products for an individual who subsequently donates hematopoietic cells.
