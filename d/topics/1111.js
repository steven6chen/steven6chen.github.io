AA refers to pancytopenia in association with bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoplasia/aplasia,</span> most often due to immune injury to multipotent hematopoietic stem cells. The term &quot;aplastic anemia&quot; is a misnomer because the disorder is characterized by pancytopenia rather than anemia alone.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of AA. Our approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of AA is consistent with published guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The following topics are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-pancytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained pancytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aplastic-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aplastic anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited aplastic anemia in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4065498351\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AA refers to pancytopenia in association with bone marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoplasia/aplasia,</span> and has diverse underlying causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70072 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Criteria for the diagnosis of AA are described below. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Bone marrow failure is a broader term, in which pancytopenia may be caused by bone marrow replacement (eg, by tumor or fibrosis) or myelodysplastic syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52354\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52354 \">table 2</a>), in addition to other various causes of AA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4048392768\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AA is a rare disorder. In Western countries the incidence is approximately two per million per year and the incidence is estimated to be two- to threefold higher in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. The sex ratio of AA is close to 1:1 in almost all population-based studies. Half of cases of AA occur in the first three decades of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is a defining feature of AA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1042398337\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematopoietic stem cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSCs in the bone marrow are the source of all mature cells in the peripheral blood and tissues. HSCs are multipotent (ie, can give rise to diverse cellular lineages) and generally quiescent. HSCs have the capacity for self-renewal (thereby sustaining a lifelong store of HSCs) and give rise to committed progenitor cells, which have reduced lineage potential but high proliferative capacity. Through successive mitotic divisions, progenitor cells ultimately produce fully mature blood cells.</p><p>HSCs are not morphologically identifiable (they resemble lymphoid cells), but they can be recognized and isolated based on their characteristic immunophenotype. HSCs constitute a small population within the <span class=\"nowrap\">CD34+/CD38-</span> fraction of bone marrow cells. HSCs can also be detected in the peripheral blood, from which they can be isolated for use in hematopoietic cell transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4248053426\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenic mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AA is associated with loss of HSCs and the resultant decrease in mature blood cells. When the HSC pool falls below a critical mass, the conflicting demands of self-renewal and differentiation can lead to pancytopenia.</p><p>Pathophysiologic processes that lead to loss of HSCs and cause AA include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune mechanisms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct injury to HSCs (eg, by drugs, chemicals, irradiation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clonal and genetic disorders</p><p/><p>Autoimmune damage to HSCs causes or contributes to most cases of AA, whether another underlying cause is identified or not. It is hypothesized that drugs, chemicals, viruses, or mutations alter the immunologic appearance of HSCs and lead to autoimmune <span class=\"nowrap\">destruction/suppression</span>. This hypothesis is supported by clinical observations, laboratory correlative studies, animal models, and the responsiveness of AA to immune suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>].</p><p>Cytotoxic lymphocytes and type I cytokines appear to be proximate effectors of autoimmune aplasia in AA, but there is also evidence of deficient quantity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of T-regulatory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Interferon gamma (IFN gamma), other cytokines (eg, IL-17), natural killer cells, and autoantibodies have also been implicated in immune destruction of HSCs in AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>].</p><p>IFN gamma initiates a cytokine cascade and induces the Fas receptor, and both are implicated in increased apoptotic death of HSCs in AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17,23-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,23-29</a>]. IFN gamma is detected in the bone marrow of patients with acquired AA, and disappears in response to immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In one report, 96 percent of patients with circulating IFN gamma-containing T cells subsequently responded to immunosuppressive therapy, while only 32 percent who lacked IFN gamma-containing lymphocytes improved; 12 of 13 subjects in whom IFN gamma was present during relapse responded to reinstitution of immunosuppressive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>AA is occasionally associated with certain conditions in which the mechanism of HSC loss is poorly understood. Examples include anorexia nervosa (often associated with gelatinous degeneration and serous fat atrophy of bone marrow), pregnancy, and as a complication of orthotopic liver transplantation (especially in the context of fulminant hepatic failure). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management#H31379427\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults and adolescents: Medical complications and their management&quot;, section on 'Hematologic'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62533888\"><span class=\"h2\">Clonal evolution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AA may coexist with or evolve into another hematologic disorder (eg, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH], myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], acute myeloid leukemia [AML]).</p><p>There is controversy about whether specific treatments of AA foster clonal evolution. A meta-analysis and a randomized trial did not detect an association between the development of PNH, MDS, or AML and treatment with immunosuppression plus growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Earlier observational studies that reported such a link could not distinguish association from causality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-39</a>].</p><p>Clonal evolution in AA may be detected by the acquisition of mutations or cytogenetic abnormalities. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly mutated genes include <em>DMNT3A</em>, <em>ASXL1,</em> <em>BCOR,</em> <em>BCORL1, </em>and <em>PIGA</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

In some cases cytopenias arise while the patient is still taking the medication. In other cases the effects are not recognized until days or weeks after exposure. The unpredictable response in such idiosyncratic reactions can make it challenging to indict a particular drug as the cause of AA.</p><p>Many drugs, including sulfonamides, antiseizure medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felbamate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felbamate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> have been associated with AA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70072 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,43-46</a>]. The vast majority of patients exposed to these drugs do not develop AA, and the reason for idiosyncratic reactions is unknown. The only potential predisposing factors that have been identified are mutations in genes encoding cellular efflux pumps (eg, P-glycoprotein 1) or drug metabolizing enzymes (eg, glutathione-S-transferase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/47-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-52</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Chloramphenicol</a> is associated with both idiosyncratic and predictable bone marrow suppression. An idiosyncratic reaction to chloramphenicol causes irreversible bone marrow aplasia in approximately 1 of every 20,000 patients, with a sudden onset several months after therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aplastic-anemia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Chloramphenicol is also associated with predictable, reversible dose-related bone marrow suppression in virtually all patients due to a direct toxic effect on bone marrow erythroid precursors; this is manifest as a ring of vacuoles around the proerythroblast nucleus and is associated with increased serum iron, because iron is inefficiently utilized for hemoglobin synthesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435797312\"><span class=\"h3\">Ionizing radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ionizing radiation has a predictable, dose-dependent bone marrow suppressive effect, which is discussed in more detail separately.
