Nosebleeds (medical term is &quot;epistaxis&quot;) are very common. Almost every person has had at least one in their lifetime. They are usually caused by dry air or nose-picking.</p><p>If you or your child gets a nosebleed, the important thing is to know how to manage it properly. With the right self-care, most nosebleeds will stop on their own.</p><p>This topic will outline the circumstances in which a nosebleed warrants immediate medical attention, explain proper self-care for a nosebleed, list the common causes of nosebleeds, and suggest some steps to help prevent recurrent nosebleeds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main types of nosebleed, and one can be more serious than the other:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior nosebleeds originate toward the front of the nose and cause blood to flow out through the nostrils. This is the most common type of nosebleed and it is not usually serious.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior nosebleeds originate toward the back of the nasal passage, near the throat. Posterior nosebleeds are less common than anterior nosebleeds, but they can be serious and can cause a lot of blood loss. Children do not usually get posterior nosebleeds.</p><p/><p>You should seek emergency medical care if your nosebleed or your child&rsquo;s:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involves massive bleeding or makes it hard to breathe</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes you or your child to become pale, fatigued, or disoriented</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will not stop even after trying the self-care steps outlined below</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Happens after recent nasal surgery or if you have a known nasal tumor</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occurs with other serious symptoms, such as chest pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occurs after an injury, such as being hit in the face, and you are concerned that you could have other injuries (eg, broken bone)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will not stop bleeding and you take medications that prevent clotting, such as warfarin (brand names: Coumadin, Jantoven), clopidogrel (brand name: Plavix), dabigatran (brand name: Pradaxa), rivaroxiban (brand name: Xarelto), fondaparinux (brand name: Arixtra), or daily aspirin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will not stop and you have multiple bruises or other areas of bleeding, or you have had repeated nosebleeds.</p><p/><p>If you are having symptoms such as chest pain, lightheadedness, or if bleeding is severe, you should call for emergency medical help. In the United States and Canada, this means calling 911. Do <strong>not</strong> drive yourself to the hospital. </p><p>If you are bleeding but do not have other symptoms, have someone else drive you to the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NOSEBLEED SELF-CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the right self-care, most nosebleeds will stop. Here's what you should do if you get one:</p><p>1. Gently blow your nose to get rid of some of the clots that have formed inside your nostrils. This may increase the bleeding temporarily, but that's OK. For young children, this step is not necessary.</p><p>2. Sit or stand while bending forward slightly at the waist. Do not lie down or tilt your head back. This may cause you to swallow blood and can lead to vomiting.</p><p>3. Grip the soft part of BOTH nostrils at the bottom of your nose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F104672\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104672 \">picture 1</a>). Do not grip the bony bridge of your nose, as that will not help the bleeding, and do not apply pressure to just one side, even if the bleeding is only on one side.</p><p>4. Squeeze your nose closed for at least 5 minutes (for children) or 10 to 15 minutes (for adults), and use a clock to time yourself. Do not release the pressure every so often to check whether the bleeding has stopped. Many people hurt their chances of stopping the bleeding by releasing the pressure too soon.</p><p>5. If you want, you can also apply a cold compress or ice pack to the bridge of your nose. This may help the blood vessels constrict and slow the bleeding. This step is not usually necessary, but many people like to do it.</p><p>If you follow the steps outlined above, and your nose continues to bleed, repeat all the steps once more. Apply pressure for a total of at least <strong>30 minutes</strong>. If you continue to bleed, seek emergency medical care, either at an emergency room or at an urgent care clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NOSEBLEED CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inside of the nose has a lot of blood vessels that are close to the surface, so it's easy for them to get irritated or injured. Most nosebleeds are caused by nothing more than the irritation from dry or cold air, or by injury caused by nose-picking.</p><p>Sometimes people get nosebleeds because they are suffering from allergies or a cold, and their nose has become inflamed. Other times, nosebleeds happen because of an injury to the face caused by a fall, a bike accident, or other trauma. Only rarely are nosebleeds caused by serious issues, such as bleeding disorders, blood vessel abnormalities, or cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you take medications to prevent blood clots, you are more likely to get nosebleeds and to have trouble stopping a nosebleed once it starts.</p><p>Examples of the medications that can cause these problems include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warfarin (brand names: Coumadin, Jantoven)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dabigatran (brand name: Pradaxa)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rivaroxiban (brand name: Xarelto)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fondaparinux (brand name: Arixtra)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clopidogrel (brand name: Plavix)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily aspirin</p><p/><p>If you take one (or more) of these medications and you get frequent nosebleeds, mention it to your health care provider.</p><p>In addition, nosebleeds can be a side effect of nose sprays used for allergy symptoms. If you use one of these sprays and you develop a nosebleed, talk to your health care provider about temporarily stopping the spray. If you get frequent nosebleeds, you may need to completely stop using the spray. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-seasonal-allergies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Allergic rhinitis (seasonal allergies) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">What if I get repeated nosebleeds?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frequent nosebleeds can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constant exposure to dry air</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consistent use of steroid nasal sprays (such as those used to manage allergies or congestion)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurring colds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Snorting drugs into your nose, such as cocaine</p><p/><p>In some cases, recurring nosebleeds can be a sign of a bleeding disorder. But when bleeding disorders are present, there are often other clues. For example, people with bleeding disorders tend to bruise easily and may bleed more than expected after minor injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=von-willebrand-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: von Willebrand disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NOSEBLEED TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you wind up needing medical care for a nosebleed, your health care provider will focus first on making sure you can breathe properly and on getting the bleeding to stop. </p><p>If the bleeding will not stop and the health care provider can see the source of the bleeding, he or she may stop the bleeding using a chemical or an electrical device. In severe cases, health care providers can pack the nose with a sponge, gauze, foam, or other materials that can help stop the bleeding. People with serious nosebleeds may need to have a balloon inflated deep within their nose to get the bleeding under control. Some patients with prolonged, significant bleeding may be given intravenous fluids for blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-epistaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with epistaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A health care provider can also check the nose for growths or tumors or for blood vessel abnormalities. A growth or tumor may be more likely if only one nostril bleeds repeatedly or bleeding is associated with malodorous discharge. Another explanation for one-sided bleeding or odorous discharge is the presence of a foreign body. When examining children with unexplained nosebleeds, health care providers often find beads, rubber erasers, and even button batteries deep inside the nose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of epistaxis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-epistaxis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of epistaxis in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>If you have any suspicion that your child could have a small battery in their nose, you should immediately take your child to the emergency department.
