Most studies have shown that few thyroid nodules regress in patients taking thyroid hormone. However, suppressive therapy does appear to interfere with goitrogenesis in many patients, and it has been proposed that it could reduce the risk of thyroid oncogenesis, as well. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) does not recommend suppression therapy of benign thyroid nodules in iodine sufficient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review potential benefits and risks of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy in patients with benign nodules or goiter. The overall approach to the evaluation and treatment of patients with goiter and with thyroid nodules, as well as the use of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy in thyroid cancer, is discussed separately.

Although the pathogenesis of thyroid nodules and sporadic nontoxic multinodular goiters is poorly understood, TSH is presumed to be necessary if not sufficient, and therefore, suppression of TSH secretion might be expected to result in a decrease in nodule or goiter size or at least prevent further enlargement.</p><p>The importance of TSH in goiter formation varies with the cause of the goiter. For example, in patients with iodine deficiency or chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, an increase in TSH secretion is the predominant cause of goiter. In contrast, most patients with thyroid nodules or sporadic nontoxic multinodular goiters have normal serum TSH concentrations. In them, particularly those with nontoxic multinodular goiters, the thyroid enlargement is probably caused by several growth factors (including TSH) that act over time on thyroid follicular cells that have different synthetic and growth potentials. The result is diffuse and later multinodular thyroid enlargement; some nodules eventually become autonomous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and others may undergo cystic degeneration.</p><p>Because thyroid hormone is presumed to reduce goiter size by reducing TSH secretion, suppressive therapy would be expected to be <strong>ineffective</strong> in patients in whom serum TSH concentrations were already subnormal due to autonomous thyroid hormone production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NONTOXIC GOITER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of a history of childhood head and neck irradiation, we presently do not routinely treat euthyroid goitrous patients from areas of iodine sufficiency with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> (T4). However, in iodine-deficient patients, or selected younger patients who are concerned about growth of their goiter, a trial of T4 aiming either for minimal TSH suppression or a low-normal TSH is a reasonable intervention pending further studies, especially those that assess the efficacy of suppressing serum TSH into the low-normal range (see <a href=\"#H1785833\" class=\"local\">'TSH goal'</a> below).

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a double-blind trial, 78 patients with nontoxic goiter (average thyroid volume 53 mL) were randomly assigned T4 or placebo for nine months and then followed for an additional nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thyroid volume, as assessed by ultrasonography, decreased in a greater proportion of patients in the T4 group (58 versus 5 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54294\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54294 \">figure 1</a>). In the responders, the mean decrease in thyroid volume was 25 percent.

Compared with baseline values, treatment with T4 for one year significantly reduced mean thyroid volume (15.6 to 10.6 mL), mean dominant nodule volume (1.8 to 0.8 mL), and the number of nodules greater than 5 mm (0.8 to 0.4). In contrast, those parameters significantly increased from baseline in controls (14.8 to 20.0 mL, 1.2 to 2.5 mL, and 0.7 to 1.5, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1785833\"><span class=\"h2\">TSH goal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is possible that the benefits of T4 therapy do not require suppression to subnormal serum TSH concentrations. In one trial, 49 patients from Istanbul (a city with reported adequate iodine intake) with solitary thyroid nodules were randomly assigned to receive high-dose (serum TSH &lt;0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> or low-dose (serum TSH 0.4 to 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> T4 therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. High- and low-dose T4 therapy were equally effective in reducing nodule volume (36 and 45 percent reduction in nodule size in the high- and low-dose groups, respectively).</p><p>In another trial of T4 therapy, 1024 patients with mild to moderate iodine deficiency and one or more thyroid nodules were randomly assigned to T4 (goal TSH 0.2 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L),</span> iodine (150 mcg, ie, the amount of iodine present in most multivitamins in the United States), T4 plus iodine, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. After one year, mean thyroid nodule volume decreased in all groups (-12.1, -9.0, -21.6, and -5.2 percent, respectively). Treatment with T4 plus iodine was significantly superior to placebo, T4, and iodine alone. Individual changes in thyroid nodule volume were variable. Decreases of more than 50 percent were seen in 7.6, 9.5, 11.3, and 8.5 percent of the nodules in the T4, iodine, T4 plus iodine, and placebo groups, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, maintaining TSH in the lower end of or just below the normal range (rather than below 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> appears to be efficacious.

There are few data to determine the efficacy of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy in reducing nodular thyroid growth in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In a nonrandomized study of 632 adults who were treated prior to age 16 with conventional radiation for nonmalignant conditions and who subsequently had benign thyroid nodules removed surgically, patients who were treated with thyroid hormone had a lower incidence of recurrent nodules than those who were not (14 versus 34 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.47-1.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

All patients with hypothyroidism require treatment with T4 (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>). However, whether irradiated euthyroid patients with one or more thyroid nodules or multinodular goiter benefit from T4 suppressive therapy is uncertain. In the absence of contraindications (such as atrial arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, or osteoporosis), some UpToDate experts treat euthyroid patients with benign thyroid nodules and a history of external radiation exposure in childhood, aiming for a low-normal or minimally subnormal serum TSH concentration. Other experts, however, would not treat such euthyroid patients, unless the serum TSH was in the upper part of the normal range (ie, &gt;3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1785743\"><span class=\"h3\">Suppressive therapy after surgery for nontoxic goiter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The apparent efficacy of thyroid hormone therapy for suppression of nontoxic goiter led to its use to prevent goiter recurrence after partial thyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].

Furthermore, in some patients solitary nodules regress spontaneously.</p><p>In view of the small percentage of thyroid nodules that regress after T4 treatment, the modest responses, and the potential adverse risks (atrial arrhythmias and reduced bone density) of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy, we do not suggest the routine use of thyroid hormone suppressive therapy for solitary palpable thyroid nodules in areas of iodine sufficiency.

However, long-term treatment appeared to be less effective, and regrowth was likely after cessation of thyroid hormone.</p><p/><p>The trials included in the meta-analyses enrolled patients with solitary thyroid nodules and ultrasonographic evaluation of nodule volume. Appropriate suppression of TSH was documented by measurement of serum TSH or by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test.</p><p>In one of the trials in the meta-analysis, 49 patients with solitary thyroid nodules were randomly assigned to receive high-dose (serum TSH &lt;0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> or low-dose (serum TSH 0.4 to 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> T4 therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. High- and low-dose T4 therapy were equally effective in reducing nodule volume (36 and 45 percent reduction in nodule size in the high- and low-dose groups, respectively). The term &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> non-suppressive therapy&quot; was suggested to describe the effects of levothyroxine on thyroid nodule growth when the goal is to reduce TSH into the low-normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In one of the trials with longer follow-up, a five-year trial from an iodine-sufficient area of Italy in which 83 patients were randomly assigned to receive T4 or no treatment, nodule volume (measured by ultrasonography) decreased in only a small subset of T4-treated patients (those with complete TSH suppression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-hormone-suppressive-therapy-for-thyroid-nodules-and-benign-goiter/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Because T4-suppressive therapy results (by definition) in subclinical hyperthyroidism, treated patients are at increased risk for atrial fibrillation, other cardiac abnormalities, or reduced bone density. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone disease with hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of T4-suppression has, therefore, dramatically declined. Since only 17 to 25 percent of nodules regress and the degree of regression is modest, we do not suggest T4 suppression for solitary or dominant thyroid nodules. We do not routinely use T4 suppression for patients with nodular goiter. However, in select patients (history of external radiation exposure during childhood, iodine-deficient region, and younger patients with growing diffuse or nodular goiter who are concerned about growth of their goiter), a trial of T4 aiming either for minimal TSH suppression or a low-normal TSH is a reasonable intervention, pending further studies, especially those that assess the efficacy of suppressing serum TSH into the low-normal range, which would mitigate the adverse effects of treatment.</p><p>Speculation that suppressive therapy may reduce the risk of oncogenesis as well as goitrogenesis may result in reconsideration of T4 suppression for more patients with goiter, especially if efficacy can be demonstrated when TSH is suppressed into the low-normal range.

Only some goiters respond, while others grow despite T4 treatment. Treatment must be continued or goitrogenesis resumes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nontoxic goiter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T4 suppression may also interfere with oncogenesis in nodular goiter. (See <a href=\"#H11800002\" class=\"local\">'Oncogenesis in goiter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In iodine sufficient regions, 17 to 25 percent of patients with a solitary (or dominant) thyroid nodule will have a modest decrease in nodule size (&gt;50 percent) as a result of T4 suppression therapy. In some patients, solitary nodules regress spontaneously. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Solitary nodules'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because T4-suppressive therapy results (by definition) in subclinical hyperthyroidism, treated patients are at increased risk for atrial fibrillation, other cardiac abnormalities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduced bone density. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-disease-with-hyperthyroidism-and-thyroid-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone disease with hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most euthyroid patients with diffuse or nodular goiter, we suggest not routinely treating with T4 suppression therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, in selected patients (iodine deficient, history of childhood neck radiation, younger patients with growing diffuse or nodular goiter who are concerned about growth of their goiter), a trial of T4 aiming either for minimal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression or a low-normal TSH is a reasonable intervention. Suppressive therapy is not useful if the TSH is already subnormal. (See <a href=\"#H14735925\" class=\"local\">'Suggested approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For euthyroid patients with solitary nodules living in iodine-sufficient regions of the world, we suggest not treating with T4 suppressive therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, in iodine-deficient regions, a trial of T4 aiming for low-normal or minimally subnormal TSH concentrations may be a reasonable alternative.
