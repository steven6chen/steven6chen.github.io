However, many of these patients will have residual disease that is too small to detect using conventional techniques (ie, minimal residual disease) that puts them at risk of eventual relapse. Relapse ultimately occurs in 40 to 75 percent of patients who undergo an autologous HCT and 10 to 40 percent of those who undergo an allogeneic HCT. Discontinuation of immunosuppression followed by immunotherapy with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) may be used to treat relapse after allogeneic HCT. Other methods of immunotherapy (eg, interleukin-2, interferon alpha, dendritic cell vaccination) are under investigation for the prevention of or treatment of relapse following autologous or allogeneic HCT.</p><p>The rationale for using immunotherapy to prevent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treat the reemergence of malignancy is based in part upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rates of leukemia relapse are much higher in patients who have received identical twin (syngeneic) transplants compared with HLA-identical sibling transplants administered with identical cytotoxic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This suggests that a graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect plays a major role in reducing the risk of relapse following an allogeneic HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H91591444\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Identical twin donors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who develop acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), particularly chronic GVHD, have a lower risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The withdrawal of immunosuppression among patients with relapsing chronic myeloid leukemia after HCT may rarely result in cytogenetic remission occurring in association with GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A similar effect has been described in a patient with relapsing chronic lymphocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The infusion of donor leukocytes into patients who have relapsed following an allogeneic HCT has directly resulted in a GVT effect, especially in CML and certain subsets of lymphoma.

The basic principles underlying the pathogenesis of the GVT effect after HCT are presented separately.

While responses to the rapid tapering of immunosuppression alone have been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], responses are relatively rare unless followed by DLI. </p><p>The efficacy of DLI has been pivotal in demonstrating the role of graft-versus-tumor (GVT) reactions in controlling hematologic malignancy. Since the initial reports in the 1980s, a number of studies have documented that reinfusion of unmanipulated leukocytes results in significant clinical responses in relapsed patients, particularly those with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Responses have also been noted in lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and multiple myeloma (MM), but are rare in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. DLI is not without side effects. Approximately 60 to 70 percent of patients receiving a DLI will develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The use of DLI should be avoided in patients with ongoing active GVHD and in patients who have converted to host (rather than donor) chimerism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Donor lymphocyte infusion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Donor lymphocyte infusion'</a>.)</p><p>A retrospective analysis evaluated the correlation between GVHD and relapse as a surrogate marker for the susceptibility of disease to a GVT effect in 48,111 first allogeneic HCTs performed between 1998 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among patients with CML, there was a clear decline in relapse in proportion to the severity of acute and chronic GVHD. A similar correlation between relapse and GVHD was seen in patients with ALL and <span class=\"nowrap\">BCR/ABL-negative</span> myeloproliferative syndromes (eg, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, myelofibrosis). The association was still present but less dramatic among patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and lymphoproliferative disorders. In contrast, GVHD was only associated with small reductions in relapse among patients with AML and plasma cell dyscrasias (eg, MM).</p><p>DLI may also help with engraftment in the setting of mixed chimerism post-HCT. One report described a child with homozygous sickle cell disease with decreasing donor chimerism following allogeneic HCT from an HLA-identical sibling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The use of DLI was associated with easily treated acute GVHD, and resulted in full donor chimerism with reversal of his anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-sickle-cell-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Donor lymphocyte infusion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the mechanism by which DLI results in clinical responses is unclear, it is presumed to be a T cell-mediated process. Further analysis of larger numbers of patients is critical to fully understand the mechanisms involved in this response.</p><p>Some data suggest that DLI normalizes the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and expands the antileukemic cell population. In one study, for example, the TCR repertoire was analyzed before and after DLI among four patients with relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 10 normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Initially, the patients' repertoire was characterized by a large number of oligoclonal and clonal patterns, while all controls had a polyclonal pattern. Following infusion of CD4+ lymphocytes, these abnormal patterns slowly normalized over the ensuing several months; by one year, all four patients had an almost normal TCR repertoire. In each patient, expansion of at least one TCR subfamily coincided with the time of disappearance of Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells.</p><p>These findings provide evidence of clonal expansion of allogeneic T cells that may be selective mediators of the antileukemic effect. In another study, patients with relapsed CML responding to DLI generated potent antibody responses to CML-associated antigens, suggesting the development of coordinated T and B cell immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>A third proposed mechanism relies upon the interaction between infused CD4+ T cells and resident CD8+ T cells. In a study that evaluated the T cell populations in the bone marrow before and after CD4+ DLI for CML, response to DLI was associated with a higher number of CD8+ T cells in the marrow prior to DLI, a gene expression profile (GEP) pattern of T cell &quot;exhaustion&quot; prior to DLI, an increase in CD8+ T cells after infusion, and reversal of the &quot;exhaustion&quot; pattern on GEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients who did not have a significant number of &quot;exhausted&quot; CD8+ T cells in the marrow prior to DLI did not achieve disease control. These results suggest that the infused CD4+ T cells enable the CD8+ T cells to overcome &quot;exhaustion&quot; and target the CML.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) varies with the underlying malignancy, the dose of infused lymphocytes, and the degree of host lymphodepletion. Outcomes are best for patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) followed by patients with lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and acute leukemia (mostly acute myeloid leukemia). Initial studies also suggest that the presence of host-derived regulatory T cells decreases the antitumor effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients who respond to DLI will usually demonstrate a clinical response within two to three months, but a full response may take one year or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Responses can be durable with reports of responses lasting up to 20 years.</p><p>Data regarding the efficacy of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) come primarily from small case series and two large retrospective studies from Europe and North America:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation reported the results with DLI obtained from 84 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 23 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 22 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In this retrospective analysis, 73 percent of patients with relapsed CML had a complete remission after DLI. Remissions, whether defined by molecular or hematologic criteria, were durable. Patients with AML and ALL did not respond as well, as only 29 and zero percent developed a complete remission, respectively.<br/><br/>DLI treatment was associated with substantial toxicity: 41 percent developed clinically significant GVHD; 41 percent suffered from myelosuppression; and 13 percent died of causes other than their underlying malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second retrospective analysis (from 25 North American programs) reported the outcomes after DLI in 140 allogeneic transplant patients who relapsed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A response rate of 60 percent was observed for patients with CML. The responses were superior in patients with only cytogenetic relapse or for those treated with DLI while in chronic phase, compared with those who had progressed to either accelerated or blast phases. As in the European study, the results were not as favorable among patients with AML or ALL (15 and 18 percent complete response, respectively). Complications included GVHD (60 percent) and pancytopenia (19 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Successful responses to DLI have also been described in multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study of 63 patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma following non-myeloablative allogeneic HCT reported an overall response rate of 38 percent (19 percent complete) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Acute and chronic GVHD were seen in 38 and 43 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Donor lymphocyte infusion'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The decreased response of relapsed acute leukemia to DLI may be due to the more rapid proliferative capacity of malignant cells, since a full response to DLI often requires months. As a result, some clinicians have advocated the use of chemotherapy to first debulk the disease prior to DLI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other clinicians have advocated the use of DLI in patients with acute leukemia and minimal residual disease following HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 57 patients with AML, CML, or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) relapsing after allogeneic transplant received cytarabine-based chemotherapy, followed by G-CSF-primed DLI without prophylactic immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Toxicity was appreciable, with a 56 percent incidence of GVHD; treatment-related mortality and two-year overall survival rates were 23 and 19 percent, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that those with a post-transplant remission of &ge;6 months had a relative odds of remission following this treatment approach of 3.7 (95% CI: 1.1-12). Patients with a complete response or no response to this treatment had one-year survival rates of 51 and 5 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 814 patients with standard-risk AML, ALL, or MDS who received allogeneic HCT in first or second complete remission were assessed for minimal residual disease (MRD) to determine eligibility for prophylactic DLI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients with MRD were eligible for DLI if they had a donor available and had no evidence of active GVHD (56 patients). Patients with MRD who did not have a donor were treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2, 49 patients). When compared with IL-2, DLI resulted in superior rates of disease-free (56 versus 24 percent) and overall (58 versus 28 percent) survival at three years. This compared to rates of disease-free and overall survival at three years of 62 and 66 percent, respectively, in patients with no evidence of MRD after HCT.</p><p/><p>Responses to DLI can be remarkably durable. For example, in an analysis of 66 patients with CML who relapsed and received DLI, 67 percent achieved a molecular complete remission (CR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For those patients achieving a molecular CR, 95 percent were alive and in continuous CR at three years following DLI. Similar results have been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037110845\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main complications following DLI are the emergence of graft-versus-host disease and myelosuppression. DLI should be avoided in patients with ongoing active GVHD and in patients who have converted to host (rather than donor) chimerism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of GVHD after DLI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infusion of unmanipulated donor leukocytes produces graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in 40 to 60 percent of recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The rate appears to be independent of the underlying disorder, but may increase as the dose of DLI increases. The association between DLI and GVHD is further complicated by the difficulty in knowing when to treat GVHD after it occurs, since the graft-versus-host effect is clearly related to a concurrent graft-versus-tumor (GVT) response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18,19,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,29-31</a>]. However, some patients have developed a GVT response without GVHD, thereby suggesting that these two effects may be separable in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

As an example, an intriguing report described five patients with relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received autologous T cells modified with a lentiviral vector expressing chimeric antigen receptor with specificity for CD19, coupled with CD137 and CD3-zeta signalling domains after a preparatory regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. All five patients demonstrated a molecular remission, which allowed them to become eligible for subsequent hematopoietic cell transplantation. Toxicity included significant cytokine elevations, some of which required treatment with steroid therapy. A similar approach has been used for patients with other hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Further follow-up of these patients and larger trials are needed to determine the efficacy of this approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults#H23720941\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical trials'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;, section on 'Investigational therapies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with malignancy who undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) will attain a complete remission, but relapse will occur in 40 to 75 percent of patients who undergo an autologous HCT and 10 to 40 percent of those who undergo an allogeneic HCT. Immunotherapy takes advantage of the innate graft-versus-tumor effect following allogeneic HCT to prevent or treat relapse following HCT. The preemptive use of immunotherapy remains experimental. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinuation of immunosuppression followed by unmanipulated donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) may be used to treat patients with relapse following an allogeneic HCT. Response varies with hematologic malignancy being highest with chronic myeloid leukemia. Responses have also been noted in lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and multiple myeloma, but are rare in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A clinical response is usually seen within two to three months, but a full response may take one year or longer. Responses can be durable, lasting up to 20 years. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main complications following DLI are the emergence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and myelosuppression. DLI should be avoided in patients with ongoing active GVHD and in patients who have converted to host (rather than donor) chimerism. (See <a href=\"#H1037110845\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ideal dose and timing of DLI is not known and clinical practice varies. Doses between 3 x 10<sup>7</sup> T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> and 4.5 x 10<sup>8</sup> T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> appear reasonable. If there is no clinical response by three months post-DLI, a second DLI infusion may be considered. DLI may be most effective at the first sign of relapse. (See <a href=\"#H1112077615\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various techniques have been used to manipulate the donor lymphocyte graft in an effort to increase the lymphocyte specificity to eradicate tumor while minimizing effects on the host. As yet, these techniques are considered experimental and require further study in humans before they can be widely applied. (See <a href=\"#H1037110883\" class=\"local\">'Manipulated grafts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other experimental methods of immunotherapy include the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor, interleukin-2, interferon alfa, antigen-pulsed dendritic cell vaccination, and HLA mismatched HCT.
