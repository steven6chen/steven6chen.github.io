LIP may be part of a spectrum with other relatively benign lymphoid disorders of the lung, which include follicular bronchiolitis, intraparenchymal lymph nodes, bronchial-associated lymphoid hyperplasia, and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. It is important to distinguish LIP from angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (now classified as angioimmunoblastic lymphoma), which is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder that can also occur in association with forms of leukemia, and which has different treatment regimens and prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of LIP in infants and children will be presented here. LIP in adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphoid-interstitial-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence and prevalence of LIP in children are not known. Relatively little has been published about LIP in children. In a 2017 report from a large European registry, only three cases of LIP were reported among 346 total cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in children that were submitted over a three-year time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. LIP most often occurs in association with underlying conditions, such as autoimmune disease and immunodeficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>], but also occurs in familial and idiopathic forms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70714 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. LIP occurs in a substantial number of children with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) if they are not treated with antiretroviral agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and usually presents in the second or third year of life. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LIP is characterized by a diffuse infiltrate of mature and immature lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes in the alveolar septae and pulmonary interstitium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71770\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71770 \">picture 1</a>). Nodular formation of lymphocytes is commonly seen, occasionally with germinal centers. The cellular infiltrate is polyclonal, including both B and T cells, usually with a predominance of CD8 lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Fibrosis is not a typical feature. However, if there is a significant nodular component, it may distort the pulmonary architecture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Further, the blood vessels and airways are not involved in classic LIP. However, some cases demonstrate a spectrum of lymphoid hyperplasia including airway involvement, resulting in findings that may be described as follicular bronchiolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the pathogenesis of LIP is unknown, several theories have been suggested. LIP may result from an exaggerated immunologic response to inhaled or circulating antigens <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> caused by a primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], HIV, or an unknown source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Immune dysregulation may play a role in the pathogenesis of LIP, and in some cases, LIP may be a premalignant state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. An immunogenetic basis also has been postulated since HLA-DR5 markers have been found in adults with LIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Cytokines including TNF-alpha and IL-1 are elevated to a greater extent in children with HIV and LIP than in children with HIV without LIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of EBV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous investigations, limited by the small number of included patients, have shown evidence of EBV in patients with HIV infection and LIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/12,13,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,17,18</a>]. However, the role of EBV infection in the development of LIP remains unclear. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study examining lung biopsy specimens from 17 patients with AIDS, EBV DNA was detected in 8 of the 10 biopsy specimens diagnosed with LIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case-control study of HIV infected children, serologic evidence of recrudescent or primary EBV infection was observed in all seven children with LIP but in only 2 of 13 children (15 percent) without LIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of nine children vertically infected with HIV-1 Subtype E who had biopsy-proven LIP, all had EBV identified in the lung by EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization. Interestingly, in six of nine cases, EBV was found in 30 to 50 percent of Langerhans and related dendritic cells, whereas only 30 percent of T and B cells were infected, suggesting that Langerhans cells are more readily infected and may be a reservoir for EBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 20 children with HIV-1 and chronic lung disease, EBV expression was detected in the majority of lung samples but without significant association with pulmonary lymphoid <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperplasia/LIP</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p>The role of EBV infection in non-HIV-related LIP also is unclear. EBV-associated LIP has been reported in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>] without HIV infection. In one study of seven lung biopsy specimens from patients with LIP, EBV DNA was detected in three specimens by polymerase chain reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This suggests that EBV may be associated with some, but not all, cases of non-HIV-related LIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3337865211\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A growing number of specific genetic mutations have been identified that are associated with a spectrum of pulmonary disease in children with immunodeficiencies and immune dysfunction, including mutations in <em>STAT3, GATA-2, COPA</em>, and <em>LRBA </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]<em>. </em>In particular, mutations in <em>STAT3</em> have been shown to lead to autoimmunity and LIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Mutations in <em>LRBA</em>, which encodes a protein involved in trafficking of CTLA4 in Treg cells, have also been identified in patients with common variable immunodeficiency and LIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The clinical availability of genetic testing for new disorders is rapidly evolving, and consultation with an immunologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic counselor can aid in decisions regarding the approach to genetic testing.

In addition, lung biopsy, which is required for diagnosis of non-HIV-related LIP, may not be necessary in children with HIV. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV-related LIP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LIP is more common in perinatally-acquired than in transfusion-acquired HIV. Before intervention to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV infection became widely available in the United States, children with perinatally acquired HIV infection typically presented in the second to third year of life. In one retrospective review of 172 children with perinatally acquired HIV, 17 percent presented with LIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The median age of presentation with LIP was 14 months, with a range of 5 to 60 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The onset of HIV-related LIP generally is insidious. Cough and tachypnea are often noted. However, auscultation of the chest reveals few abnormalities. Digital clubbing occurs commonly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Extrapulmonary manifestations include generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and salivary gland enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Hypergammaglobulinemia, which is usually present, is thought to be secondary to an imbalance of immunoregulatory cells in the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical course is variable. Spontaneous clinical remission sometimes is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Exacerbation of clinical signs and symptoms may occur in association with intercurrent viral respiratory illnesses. In severe cases, progressive hypoxia and respiratory failure occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-HIV-related LIP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-HIV-related LIP is less common than HIV-related LIP. Non-HIV-related LIP shares the classic presentation of other forms of ILD, including symptoms of tachypnea, cough, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and frequent respiratory infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-and-child-with-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant and child with diffuse lung disease (interstitial lung disease)&quot;</a>.) In the absence of HIV, other causes of immunodeficiency and autoimmune disorders should be considered.</p><p>On physical examination, the most common findings include retractions, tachypnea, and basilar crackles. Evidence of growth failure, cyanosis, clubbing, and increased intensity of the second component of the second heart sound (P2) are present in the more severe cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Generalized lymphadenopathy is rare; if it is detected, malignancy should be considered. Hypogammaglobulinemia is present occasionally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung biopsy is usually necessary to diagnose LIP and to distinguish it from benign lymphoid disorders of the lung. However, in patients with documented HIV infection, the presentation of dyspnea with associated hypoxia and classic radiographic findings of micronodular infiltrates may be enough for the diagnosis of LIP without further invasive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function testing in both HIV-related and non-HIV-related LIP, as in other forms of ILD, typically demonstrates a pattern of restrictive disease, with reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced vital capacity in one second (FEV1) as well as normal <span class=\"nowrap\">FEV1/FVC</span> ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Obstructive lung disease may also be present when overlapping pathologies such as follicular bronchiolitis are present. Measurement of oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry helps to determine the severity of illness and may have prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The nodular pattern can wax and wane, and has been noted to disappear completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In some cases, hyperinflation may be the only radiographic abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Air space consolidation, bronchiectasis, and cystic lung changes have been observed in advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/36,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,39</a>].</p><p>Non-HIV-related LIP is also characterized by a diffuse reticulonodular pattern most prominent in the lower lobes, but may vary from a purely linear interstitial process affecting the bases and perihilar regions to a more nodular process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, a ground glass abnormality may be the only radiographic finding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82288\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82288 \">image 1</a>). Cystic lung disease may also occur. Mediastinal or hilar adenopathy is rarely found, and if detected, should warrant further investigation for a malignancy.

The diagnostic yield of VATS and open lung biopsy (OLB) are similar. However, because VATS has less morbidity with respect to duration of surgery, chest tube drainage, and hospitalization, it is becoming the method of choice for lung biopsy in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Whatever method is used, the lung biopsy specimen must be processed in a consistent manner and should be analyzed by an experienced pediatric pathologist.

However, there is evidence of considerable chronic respiratory morbidity associated with LIP and HIV. The incidence of acute lower respiratory tract infection in children with LIP is twice the rate of those infected with HIV without LIP, and tenfold higher than reported in non-HIV infected children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Death in both HIV-related and non-HIV-related LIP may occur secondary to infectious complications of treatment, end-stage pulmonary fibrosis, or rarely, malignant lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lymphocytic-interstitial-pneumonia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18163162\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) remains a form of pulmonary lymphoproliferative disease. LIP most often occurs in association with underlying conditions, such as autoimmune disease and immunodeficiencies, but also occurs in familial and idiopathic forms. LIP occurs in 25 to 40 percent of children with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and usually presents in the second or third year of life. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LIP may result from an exaggerated immunologic response to inhaled or circulating antigens <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> caused by a primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HIV, or an unknown source. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with perinatally acquired HIV infection, LIP typically presents in the second or third year of life. The onset of HIV-related LIP generally is insidious, with cough and tachypnea, and sometimes digital clubbing and hypergammaglobulinemia. The clinical course is variable, and spontaneous clinical remission sometimes is observed. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'HIV-related LIP'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-HIV-related LIP is less common than HIV-related LIP. Non-HIV-related LIP shares the classic presentation of other forms of ILD, including symptoms of tachypnea, cough, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and frequent respiratory infections. In the absence of HIV, other causes of immunodeficiency and autoimmune disorders should be considered. Generalized lymphadenopathy is rare; if it is detected, malignancy should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Non-HIV-related LIP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiography in LIP typically reveals a diffuse symmetric reticulonodular or nodular pattern occasionally associated with mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. Lung biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of non-HIV-related LIP and is important in confirming the diagnosis of HIV-related LIP. In patients with documented HIV infection, the presence of typical clinical and radiographic features may be sufficient to make the diagnosis without lung biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children in whom LIP is diagnosed should undergo an evaluation for underlying immunodeficiencies or autoimmune diseases that are associated with LIP, if not already known (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70714 \">table 1</a>). To guide this workup, consultation with an immunologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rheumatologist should be considered in children with unexplained LIP. (See <a href=\"#H909317370\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for associated diseases'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pharmacologic therapy for pediatric LIP differs for HIV-related and non-HIV-related illness. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For both HIV-related and non-HIV-related LIP, corticosteroid therapy has been shown to be beneficial in uncontrolled studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children with HIV-related LIP, use of antiviral agents to control the underlying HIV infection is critical. In addition, periodic intravenous gammaglobulin has shown to be useful for slowing and even halting progression of LIP. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Hydroxychloroquine</a> is an alternative to corticosteroid therapy. </p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong> &mdash; The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Cynthia Epstein, MD and Leland Fan, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Fan LL.
