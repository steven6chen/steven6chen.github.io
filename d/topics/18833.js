Premature babies are sometimes called &quot;preemies&quot; for short.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H877973642\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes premature birth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's not always possible to know the cause. But some things that might cause a woman to go into labor early include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding or other problems in the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being pregnant with twins, triplets, or more babies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection in the uterus or other part of the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems during pregnancy, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart or kidney problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking, drinking alcohol, or using illegal drugs during pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H877973680\"><span class=\"h1\">What kinds of problems can premature babies have after birth?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature babies can have many different problems after being born. In general, the earlier a baby was born and the less he or she weighed, the more likely he or she is to have health problems. But every baby is different.</p><p>While a baby is still in the womb, his or her organs and body parts are growing and developing. Premature babies can have problems because they haven't had enough time to develop all the way.</p><p>Some of the more common issues are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble keeping warm &ndash; Very small babies can have trouble staying warm. There are things that can help keep a newborn baby as warm as possible, like special hats and blankets. Your baby might also be put in an incubator or &quot;isolette.&quot; This is a bed that is surrounded by clear plastic to help keep your baby safe and warm; it can also have a heater.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing problems &ndash; Premature babies sometimes have trouble breathing on their own after birth. That's usually because their lungs have not fully developed. Your baby's doctor or nurse will monitor (watch) his or her breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart problems &ndash; In some premature babies, a blood vessel that should close after birth stays open. In time, the blood vessel might close on its own, or it might need treatment. Low blood pressure is also common in premature babies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; Babies who were born early are more likely to get infections. That's because they are not able to fight off germs as well as full-term babies (born after 40 weeks of pregnancy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digestive system problems &ndash; Some premature babies have a problem with their intestines that causes diarrhea, vomiting, and sometimes blood in the bowel movements. This usually happens within a few weeks after birth, and can be serious.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding in the brain &ndash; Babies born early sometimes have bleeding inside the brain. This happens within a few days of being born. This bleeding can be mild and stop on its own, or it can be more serious. In very premature babies, brain imaging tests are done to look for this problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaundice &ndash; This is when the skin or white part of the eye turns yellow. There are ways to treat jaundice.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H877973695\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments might my baby need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on how early your baby was born, how much he or she weighs, and what health problems he or she has. Your baby might need to go to the neonatal intensive care unit, or &quot;NICU.&quot; This is a part of the hospital for babies who need special care.</p><p>A premature baby might need one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A machine to help him or her breathe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra oxygen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A feeding tube (to deliver breast milk or formula into the stomach)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light therapy (to treat jaundice)</p><p/><p>If your baby's condition is stable, the doctor or nurse might suggest that you hold your baby directly against your skin. This is called &quot;skin-to-skin&quot; contact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H877973710\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my baby have long term problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Some premature babies have health problems later in life, while others do not. The earlier a baby was born, the higher the chances of long-term problems.</p><p>Some of the problems that can affect premature babies later in life are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral palsy &ndash; Cerebral palsy is a disorder that causes problems with movement and balance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision problems &ndash; Sometimes, babies who were born very early (usually before 30 weeks of pregnancy) have problems with their eyes. If this isn't treated, it can cause trouble seeing. An eye doctor can check your baby's eyes and suggest treatments if needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems affecting the brain &ndash; Some premature babies grow up to have problems with thinking, learning, or memory, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There are programs that can help babies and children whose problems are caught early.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth problems &ndash; Very premature babies are more likely to grow up to be shorter and weigh less than average.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ongoing health issues &ndash; Babies who were born premature might get sick more often as children or adults.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H877973725\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I get support?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having a premature baby can be hard and stressful. Social workers and hospital chaplains (spiritual counselors) can provide support during this difficult time. There are also support groups for parents of premature babies. It can be helpful to talk to other people who are going through the same things. Try to get help from these sources and from relatives and friends. That way you will have support both in the hospital and at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H877973740\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-expect-in-the-nicu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What to expect in the NICU (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preterm labor (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Jaundice in babies (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-necrotizing-enterocolitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Newborn necrotizing enterocolitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-in-newborn-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sepsis in newborn babies (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-palsy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cerebral palsy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=having-twins-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Having twins (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pumping-breast-milk-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pumping breast milk (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
