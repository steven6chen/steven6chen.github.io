Palliative medicine services, including setting patient-centered achievable goals for medical care and aggressive symptom management, should be routinely offered alongside curative and disease-modifying treatments for patients with serious illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The traditional model of medical care has been dichotomous, with curative or disease-modifying treatment offered initially and comfort care provided only <span class=\"nowrap\">when/if</span> these measures are no longer appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64252\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64252 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, most illnesses and personal goals do not lend themselves well to such dichotomous service models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For example, heart failure is characterized by stable disease punctuated by acute exacerbations often requiring hospitalization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72831 \">figure 1</a>). During these exacerbations, life-prolonging treatments, such as diuretics, that also improve symptom burden are administered. Within an integrated model of medical care, palliative care is provided at the same time as curative or life-prolonging treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64252\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64252 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Hospice and Palliative Medicine is now recognized as a medical subspecialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties, as well as in Canada, England, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and many other European nations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other countries are in the process of developing certification for palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Clinicians who are specifically trained in palliative care provide in-depth pain and symptom management, communication regarding goals of care, and care coordination across settings and over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, in order for the large and rapidly growing number of patients with advanced and serious illness to receive timely and high-quality palliative care, it is important that the core principles and practices of palliative care be incorporated into the practices of all clinicians. </p><p>To this end, multiple initiatives are now integrating palliative medicine education, evidence-based assessments, and treatment algorithms into the care of patients in the emergency room and intensive care unit, as well as oncology services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and other specialties that care for seriously ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/1,2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8,9</a>].

From the opening of St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospice for the Dying in 1905 and St. Christopher&rsquo;s Hospice in 1967 until the 1980s, palliative care was largely delivered through hospice programs. Until recently, palliative care was seen as care provided for people with cancer who were not receiving active treatment and were in fact dying of their disease. It is now recognized that the principles of palliative care are just as applicable earlier in the course of any serious illness, even if that disease is potentially curable, and that palliative care can and should be provided alongside disease treatment. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) position statement, &ldquo;this change in thinking emerged from a new understanding that problems at the end of life have their origins at an earlier time in the trajectory of disease&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The following definitions reflect the modern concept of palliative care:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The WHO defines palliative care as: &ldquo;An approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have endorsed the following definition: &ldquo;Palliative care means patient and family-centered care that optimizes quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering. Palliative care throughout the continuum of illness involves addressing physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual needs and facilitating patient autonomy, access to information, and choice&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Center to Advance Palliative Care defines palliative care as: &ldquo;Specialized medical care for people with serious illnesses&hellip;focused on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, pain and stress of a serious illness &mdash; whatever the diagnosis. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specialists who work together with a patient&rsquo;s other doctors to provide an extra layer of support. It is appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness and can be provided along with curative treatment&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p>Hospice, as defined in a statute by the Medicare hospice benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], is a health care delivery system under which support and services are provided to a patient with a terminal illness where the focus is on comfort rather than curing an illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients electing hospice must agree to give up insurance coverage for continued medical treatment of the terminal illness, and two physicians must agree that the patient will die within six months if the disease follows its usual course. Thus, hospice can be considered a program that delivers palliative care to patients at the end of life, while palliative care can be appropriately offered to patients at any time along the trajectory of any type of serious illness, concurrent with curative, restorative, and any life-prolonging therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. While all care that is delivered by hospices can be considered palliative care, not all palliative care is delivered by hospice programs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H914734\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aging of the population, success of high technology medicine at prolonging the lives of those who remain seriously ill, and the increasingly fragmented medical system make it difficult for clinicians to provide the full range of services required by patients with serious illness and their families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A multicenter study of over 9000 seriously ill patients found that pain, dyspnea, anxiety, and depression were common and distressing symptoms among seriously ill patients hospitalized in US tertiary care centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Palliative care strives to assist patients with a serious life-threatening illness in achieving the following goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate control of pain and other symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Achieve a sense of control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relieve burden on family members and strengthen relationships</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gain a realistic understanding of the nature of the illness and what to expect in the future</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understand the pros and cons of available treatment alternatives and weigh them in the context of the patient&rsquo;s goals and values</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Name decision makers in case of loss of decisional capacity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have financial affairs in order</p><p/><p>Multiple studies have shown that, across a range of serious illnesses (cancer, dementia, end-stage renal disease, cardiopulmonary failure), palliative care services improve patients&rsquo; symptoms and the quality of their care at the end of life, allow patients to avoid hospitalization and to remain safely and adequately cared for at home, increase utilization of hospice, lead to better patient and family satisfaction, and significantly reduce prolonged grief and posttraumatic stress disorder among bereaved family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/26-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-34</a>]. Palliative care also lowers costs by delivering care matched to patient and family needs, thus enabling avoidance of unnecessary hospitalizations, diagnostic and treatment interventions, and intensive and emergency department care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/35-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-42</a>]. Among patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs), benefits of early proactive palliative care involvement include more and earlier ICU family meetings and shorter length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The ambulatory palliative care assessment performed in this trial focused on symptom management, patient and family coping, and illness understanding and education (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61159\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61159 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In a later analysis, patients receiving early palliative care received the same number of chemotherapy regimens as did those in the control group, but they were less likely to have chemotherapy continued close to death or to be hospitalized near end of life, and more likely to enroll in hospice for a longer duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

A survival benefit for early initiation of palliative care has been suggested by some randomized trials (including those involving patients with cancer, advanced heart failure, and nonmalignant pulmonary disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/49,50,54,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50,54,59</a>] but not by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/36,48,51,55,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,48,51,55,60,61</a>]. A systematic review of seven randomized trials totaling 2184 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/44,48-51,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,48-51,54,55</a>] concluded that there was no association between palliative care and survival (hazard ratio for death 0.90, 95% CI 0.69-1.17) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, only one of the trials was rated as having a low risk of bias.</p><p>Randomized trials have shown that comprehensive outpatient palliative care can be successfully delivered alongside disease-modifying treatment, including potentially curative treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/45,46,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46,52</a>]. This has been shown both in the hospital and ambulatory setting. The benefits of delivering palliative care concurrent with potentially curative treatment were shown in a randomized trial of inpatient palliative care consultation (twice-weekly visits mainly focused on management of physical and psychological symptoms) versus usual transplant care in 160 adults with hematologic malignancies undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. At two weeks, the intervention group had less of an increase in depression, anxiety, and overall symptom burden, and a smaller decrease in QOL; at three months, the intervention patients maintained a higher QOL and less depression, although there were no significant differences in anxiety, fatigue, or symptom burden.</p><p>Given these benefits, there is a need to change the paradigm for management of patients with serious life-threatening diseases, including but not limited to patients with advanced cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Care should include an earlier and more thorough assessment of patients&rsquo; options, concerns, goals, and preferences, and be tailored throughout the continuum of their illness to include meticulous symptom management, family support, and attention to QOL issues in addition to disease-modifying therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A year 2016 updated provisional clinical opinion from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends that dedicated palliative care services should be integrated into the care of inpatients and outpatients with advanced cancer early in the disease course, concurrent with active treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H914800\"><span class=\"h1\">PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549034660\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A primary role of palliative care is the relief of pain and other physical, psychological, and emotional symptoms.

Depression is associated with higher utilization of health care services as well as significantly increased mortality rates. Depression, with a prevalence rate of 15 to 60 percent in patients with a terminal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], is mistakenly but widely felt to be a normal concomitant of illness by health professionals, leading to under-diagnosis and under-treatment.

Depression may be due to physical symptoms, stress of prolonged illness, existential distress, or concern for family members. Untreated depression is associated with decreased functional capacity, poorer quality of life, and a desire for hastened death.

Community-based palliative care programs are important to provide important continuity of care for patients who are discharged from the hospital after being seen by an inpatient palliative care consultation service. In addition, community palliative care providers can act as consultants for patients who are not hospitalized but who have serious chronic illnesses, symptom distress, and difficulty managing complex treatment regimens. Community palliative care teams provide pain and symptom management, psychosocial and family support, skilled communication about patient and family concerns and priorities and how to address them, and coordination of home care needs, including housing, food, transportation, and equipment. Patients receive palliative care in conjunction with life-prolonging disease treatments. These services can be provided within the home, within a nursing home, within a palliative care outpatient practice, or through embedding or integration of a palliative care team within an existing outpatient primary care or specialty practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-delivery-in-the-home\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care delivery in the home&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When initiated early in the disease course, community palliative care improves clinical and quality of care outcomes, reduces crises and the associated need for acute interventions, makes it more likely that the patient will die in their own home, and may improve survival, although the available data are inconsistent, and there is a lack of controlled clinical trials addressing these issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/44,49-51,59,96-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,49-51,59,96-102</a>]. A systematic review of home-based palliative care interventions for patients with advanced cancer (six observational and two interventional studies) concluded that 44 to 90 percent of patients died at home, that studies including survival and quality of life endpoints had divergent outcomes, and that the benefits of palliative care consultation were most convincing for symptom control, especially pain and dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p>Because of the known benefits of early palliative care interventions, palliative care services and models of comanagement are increasingly present within outpatient practices, such as cancer centers. Similar to the hospital-based integrated models of palliative care discussed above, the goal is to offer concurrent palliative care alongside specialist care for patients with advanced and serious illness. Integration of palliative care in outpatient cancer centers, either through co-located teams or through use of palliative care processes, algorithms, and performance metrics is rapidly becoming a standard of practice, in part as a result of a seminal clinical trial that included over 150 patients with metastatic lung cancer randomly assigned to a palliative care intervention or standard care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Furthermore, up to 48 percent of patients in this study considered access to all available treatments as an important aspect of palliative care at the end of life, regardless of the chance of recovery. A systematic review of Physicians Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) outcomes found that only one-third of documents opted for the lowest intensity of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. A 2010 review of guidelines and policies from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia confirmed the paucity of uniform understandings of patient expectations and clinical standards for palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. The authors reported that, &ldquo;palliative care staff have to continuously adapt their model of caring to the specific needs and values of each patient&rdquo;, which emphasizes the importance of individual preferences. It can be reasonably concluded, then, that many attributes of quality palliative care can be revealed only through careful individual assessment in specific patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. Some of the issues that may influence how palliative care is perceived are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92614543\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of distressing symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree to which symptoms may cause distress, and hence be triggers for a palliative care consultation, may not be entirely clear to providers. This was shown in one study; over 340 patients with inoperable lung cancer were assessed with quality of life and symptom questionnaires and also were asked the question &ldquo;what do you find most distressing at present&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. Among the major results were that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over-arching, rather than specific causes of, distress were reported by 26 percent of patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than 60 percent of concerns reported as &ldquo;most distressing&rdquo; were identified by the questionnaires used</p><p/><p>Even when a distressing symptom is identified, however, patients do not necessarily desire the same approach to management. This was shown in another study that evaluated the experience of pain at the end of life in 988 terminally ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. While half of these patients reported the presence of moderate or severe pain, of those who saw their primary care physician for the treatment of pain in the prior four weeks (n = 514), only 30 percent wanted more treatment for pain; 9 percent requested to reduce or stop analgesic treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92614571\"><span class=\"h2\">Barriers to referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Barriers to referral for palliative care are present in both patients (and their families) as well as providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/128,129\" class=\"abstract_t\">128,129</a>]. These are illustrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One public opinion poll conducted in 2011 by the Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) found that more than three-quarters of the sample had never heard of palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. Once educated about the concurrent nature of palliative care as an added layer of support for quality of life, more than 90 percent of those polled wanted palliative care for themselves or a loved one in the face of a serious illness, felt it was important that patients and their loved ones were educated about palliative care, and felt it was important that all hospitals offered palliative care services. Despite this high level of public endorsement of the value of palliative care, two main barriers were identified: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low awareness of palliative care services among patients and their families</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The tendency of clinicians to falsely equate palliative care with end of life and hospice care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A separate poll of United States physicians identified their concerns about incorporating palliative care, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Concern that introducing palliative care could interfere with therapy directed at extending life as long as possible (42 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inadequate patient resources (78 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Issues related to a perceived lack of reimbursement for palliative care <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of reimbursement from discontinued disease treatments (82 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Shortage of palliative care physicians and services (78 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, this survey identified gaps in the education of physicians in palliative care during medical school correlated with physician age. The majority (73 percent) of physicians age 39 or younger reported exposure to palliative care during medical school, while only 36 percent of those ages 40 to 49, 23 percent of those ages 50 to 59, and 6 percent of those age 60 or older were exposed to palliative care during training.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study conducted a survey of almost 170 patients with advanced cancer to evaluate both unmet needs and the interest they had in palliative care services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. Over 60 percent of patients reported an unmet need, primarily characterized as <span class=\"nowrap\">psychological/emotional</span> or symptom-specific, and both were significantly associated with self-perceived need for palliative care services. The presence of unmet needs was not associated with patient initiation of a request for these services. However, patients were quite willing to proceed with a palliative care consult if it was suggested by their oncologist.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92614777\"><span class=\"h2\">Communicating with patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data suggest that communication about palliative care may improve openness and access to palliative care:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the <span class=\"nowrap\">CAPC/ACS</span> poll discussed above, two definitions of palliative care appeared to have a positive impact on how it was perceived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ldquo;Palliative care is specialized medical care for people with serious illnesses.

Clinicians who are specialty trained in palliative care provide in-depth pain and symptom management, skilled communication regarding goals of care, and coordinated care across settings and over time. (See <a href=\"#H549034646\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care aims to relieve suffering in all stages of disease and should be provided at the same time as all other beneficial, potentially curative, or life-prolonging treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64252\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64252 \">algorithm 1</a>). When initiated early in the disease course, palliative care has been shown to improve patient and family experience and quality of care, and randomized controlled trials in cancer and advanced lung disease also suggest that survival may be prolonged when palliative care is delivered concurrent with disease treatment. (See <a href=\"#H914734\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to palliative care, hospice is a health care delivery system under which support and services are provided to a patient with a terminal illness where the focus is on comfort rather than &ldquo;curative&rdquo; disease-focused treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, hospice can be considered a program that delivers palliative care to patients at the end of life, while palliative care can be appropriately offered to patients at any time along the trajectory of any type of serious illness. (See <a href=\"#H549034653\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A primary role of palliative care is the relief of pain and other emotional and physical symptoms, support for family caregivers, and attention to the social determinants of health and disease. Other key services are establishing goals of care, matching care plans to those goals, psychosocial, spiritual, and bereavement support, and coordination of care over time and across settings. (See <a href=\"#H914734\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care services can be provided in the hospital, nursing home, ambulatory setting, or at home. Hospital-based palliative care programs may entail a dedicated unit <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an interdisciplinary consultation service; the palliative care consultation service is the most common model. Hospice care can be provided in homes, hospitals, nursing homes, and freestanding hospice inpatient facilities. (See <a href=\"#H549034688\" class=\"local\">'Models of palliative care delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2011 consensus statement proposed criteria for identifying patients in need of palliative care assessment in the hospital setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76969 \">table 3</a>). While explicit criteria have not been developed for the community setting, referral for palliative care evaluation is appropriate for patients with one or more serious illnesses, functional or cognitive impairment, and a history of hospitalization or skilled nursing facility utilization in the prior 12 months. Other criteria for palliative care needs include poorly controlled symptoms, family caregiver burden, frequent visits to the emergency room, a prolonged hospitalization, a prolonged intensive care unit stay, or an estimated prognosis of one year or less.
