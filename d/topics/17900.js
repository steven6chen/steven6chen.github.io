The course of MS is variable. For some, MS is a disease with one or two acute neurologic episodes and no further evidence of disease activity. In others, it is a chronic relapsing or progressive disease, with an unpredictable clinical course that may span 10 to 20 years, during which time neurologic disability accumulates.</p><p>This topic will discuss treatment of progressive forms of MS. The treatment of relapsing forms of MS is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease-modifying treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other aspects of MS are reviewed elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and epidemiology of multiple sclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical course and classification of multiple sclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptom management of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATTERN AND COURSE OF MS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MS is categorized into several clinical subtypes, including relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and primary progressive MS (PPMS), as reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis#H605008275\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical course and classification of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Disease pattern'</a>.)</p><p>RRMS is characterized by clearly defined relapses with either full recovery, or with sequelae and residual deficit upon recovery. There is no or minimal disease progression during the periods between disease relapses, though individual relapses themselves may result in severe residual disability. &#160;</p><p>SPMS begins as relapsing-remitting disease, hence the designation of &quot;secondary,&quot; but over time the disease enters a stage of steady deterioration in function, unrelated to acute attacks. Typically, when the secondary progressive stage is reached, the relapse rate is also reduced. This type of MS, which ultimately develops in approximately 90 percent of patients with RRMS after 25 years, causes the greatest amount of neurologic disability. A diagnosis of SPMS is made only by taking a careful history, as there are no physical exam findings, laboratory markers, or radiographic features that separate it from RRMS. The change from RRMS to SPMS is a gradual process rather than an abrupt transition.</p><p>PPMS represents only about 10 percent of MS cases and is characterized by disease progression from onset, although occasional plateaus, temporary minor improvements, and acute relapses may occur.</p><p>These phenotypes are further modified by assessments of disease activity and disease progression. Disease activity is determined by clinical relapses or MRI evidence of contrast enhancing lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions. Disease progression is a measure of disability, and it is independently quantified from relapses; it is characteristic of PPMS and SPMS. Thus, the phenotype of progressive disease (PPMS and SPMS) can be characterized as one of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active and with progression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active but without progression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not active but with progression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not active and without progression (stable disease)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4250587417\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment directed at the progressive phase of MS is typically more difficult than treatment of relapsing forms of MS, where a number of effective disease-modifying therapies are available (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease-modifying treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>). In contrast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocrelizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ocrelizumab</a> is the only disease-modifying treatment option with high-quality evidence of efficacy for patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS) (see <a href=\"#H1372193083\" class=\"local\">'Ocrelizumab'</a> below). Therapeutic options for patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) are even more limited, though there are promising results from randomized controlled trials of siponimod for SPMS. Other clinical trials have generally found only limited or no effectiveness for the treatment of patients with SPMS and PPMS.</p><p>Most of the treatment options for progressive types of MS involve various immunosuppressive therapies (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immune-modulating treatments'</a> below). However, the nonspecific immunosuppressants suffer from the same basic defect; they may temporarily halt a rapidly progressive downhill course, but it is difficult or dangerous to employ them for more than a few months to a year or two. Since MS is an illness of decades, not months, immunosuppressive therapy is only a temporary solution at best.</p><p>Despite these obstacles, therapeutic decisions must be made. In the absence of effective disease-modifying therapy, multidisciplinary management for the common complications and symptoms of MS is critical. These complications include bladder and bowel dysfunction, cognitive impairment, depression, fatigue, gait impairment, heat intolerance, pain, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders, spasticity, speech and swallowing dysfunction, tremor, vertigo, and visual disturbances. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptom management of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immune-modulating treatment should be individualized on the basis of disease activity and progression as well as patient and physician preference. Although definitive data are lacking, subgroups of patients with progressive MS characterized by younger age, recent relapses, recent MRI disease activity, or recent disability progression may be more likely to benefit from immune-modulating therapies in comparison with patients lacking these characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although consensus is lacking, some experts believe there is no role for immune-modulating therapy in the absence of active inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Treatment recommendations differ between PPMS and SPMS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2135754011\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary progressive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although in general the results of clinical trials have been negative, some study findings and clinical experience suggest that the treatments listed below have a modest benefit for patients with SPMS. For patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who reach the stage of SPMS, particularly those with evidence of active disease by clinical or MRI measures, immune-modulating treatment options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuing the same disease-modifying therapy (DMT) used during the relapsing-remitting phase of MS, or switching to a different DMT.

The effectiveness of interferons in patients with SPMS but without relapses is uncertain.
