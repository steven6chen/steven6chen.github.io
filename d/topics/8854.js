Only a small subset of <em>V. cholerae</em> strains carry the requisite genes to cause the disease cholera. In an effort to identify cholera-causing strains, investigators studying the &quot;cholera bacillus&quot; (<em>V. cholerae</em>) in the early 1900s divided strains into two groups: those that agglutinated with serum from cholera patients (designated as being in O group 1, or <em>V. cholerae</em> O1), and those that did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This latter strain group (most of which consisted of environmental isolates) has been designated, variously, as &quot;non-cholera Vibrios&quot;, &quot;non-agglutinating <em>V. cholerae</em>&quot; (also referred to as &quot;NAGs&quot;), or &quot;non-O1 <em>V. cholerae</em>&quot;.</p><p>Subsequent serologic studies have resulted in the identification of over 200 different O groups within the species <em>V. cholerae</em>. While it is now recognized that serotype does not correlate directly with the ability to cause the disease cholera, use of these serologic designations continues to be useful with almost all cholera-causing strains falling into O group 1 or the recently recognized O group 139 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, cholera toxin-producing strains of <em>V. cholerae</em> in other serogroups have also been implicated as the cause of outbreaks of cholera-like illness (O141 and O75 in the United States; O37, O10, O12, O6, and O14 strains from other parts of the world) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. In phylogenetic studies, all cholera-associated strains tend to cluster closely together, consistent with the concept that there is an &quot;epidemic genotype&quot; that includes multiple genes necessary for epidemic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. </p><p>In general, strains outside of these serogroups (commonly referred to as <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em>&quot;) are non-pathogenic or asymptomatic colonizers in humans, or cause mild, sporadic illness (such a gastroenteritis, wound or ear infections) in otherwise health hosts. However, in persons who are immunocompromised or who have underlying liver disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> strains are capable of causing severe wound infections or sepsis, with high associated mortality rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> strains tend to be highly diverse genetically, and there is not a single route by which they cause human disease. Occurrence of illness is dependent on the particular combination of possible virulence genes carried by the infecting strain, combined with the health status of the host.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastroenteritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small number of <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> strains carry the genes for and produce cholera toxin (CT), the toxin responsible for the dehydrating diarrhea characteristically seen in epidemic cholera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/3,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,13</a>]. These strains have been associated with gastroenteritis (which, at times, may be severe) but do not appear capable of causing epidemic cholera. In phylogenetic studies, they do not cluster with <em>V. cholerae</em> strains responsible for epidemic disease and generally lack multiple <span class=\"nowrap\">genes/gene</span> complexes that have been associated with &quot;typical&quot; cholera.</p><p>Another group of <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> strains produce a heat-stable enterotoxin (designated NAG-ST), which closely resembles the heat-stable enterotoxin of enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These strains, designated &quot;enterotoxigenic <em>V. cholerae</em>,&quot; can cause diarrheal disease in humans, based on observations from volunteer studies as well as epidemiologic studies of outbreaks and sporadic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>Genetic studies have identified a type III secretion system in some strains, which may also contribute to virulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The type III secretion system has been associated with pathogenicity in other diarrheal pathogens (eg, <em>Shigella</em> spp, <em>Salmonella</em> spp, enteropathogenic <em>E. coli</em>, and other <em>Vibrio</em> species) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>The role of other virulence factors in causing disease is less clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Various extracellular products (eg, cytolysins, hemolysins, a putative exotoxin, and two different RTX toxins) have been identified, but their role in pathogenesis remains to be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/18,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24-26</a>]. In human studies, three <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> strains have been fed to volunteers [23]. One strain, which produced NAG-ST, caused illness; the other two strains did not, although they did colonize the volunteers, consistent with the idea that many isolations of <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> from stool represent identification of non-pathogenic, colonizing strains that may have been acquired incidentally from the environment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Septicemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually all <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> strains isolated from the blood are heavily encapsulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], suggesting that the degree of capsule expression is a key element in determining whether sepsis will occur. This polysaccharide capsule provides protection against serum bactericidal activity and phagocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Multiple capsular types have been identified, although data are insufficient to link these polysaccharides with virulence. The association of virulence with encapsulation is similar to that reported for <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em>, with encapsulated <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> capable of producing a <em>V. vulnificus</em>-like clinical syndrome in immunocompromised patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>V. cholerae</em> are ubiquitous in the marine environment. While generally found in estuarine areas, <em>V. cholerae</em> can grow in fresh water and have been isolated from fresh-water lakes. Vibrios have also been isolated from freshwater insect egg masses (including non-biting midges) as well as from a variety of birds, wild animals, and domestic animals (dogs, cows, goats, chickens, ducks, seagulls, horse, lambs, and bison) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p><em>V. cholerae</em> are sensitive to temperature. In temperate climates when water temperatures exceed 20&ordm;C (generally in the summer), Vibrios can be isolated easily from water, suspended particulate matter, plankton, algae, sediment, fish, and shellfish. During the winter months, <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> decline markedly in number and are found primarily in sediments. This seasonal variability is reflected in the increase in incidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> and other <em>Vibrio</em> infections seen in temperate areas during summer months. This effect has been exacerbated by global warming, leading to rises in sea surface temperature and the occurrence of localized heat waves. One example was the large cluster of <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> cases in Sweden and Finland in 2014, which was associated with a record heat wave and in which, cases occurred within 100 miles of the Arctic Circle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>In resource-rich settings, cases of gastroenteritis due to these organisms can almost always be linked to consumption of seafood, particularly raw or undercooked shellfish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In resource-limited settings, the pattern is often less clear, due in part to the increased risk of fecal contamination of food and water sources <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cross-contamination of foods by seafood.</p><p>Wound infections occur in conjunction with environmental exposure to water containing the organism. Septicemia may occur secondary to a wound infection or as a result of ingestion of the organism in shellfish or seafood (primary septicemia). Septicemia occurs almost exclusively in persons who have underlying liver disease or are immunosuppressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> have been isolated from 2 to 3 percent of patients with diarrheal illness in tropical areas (including travelers); isolation rates are higher in coastal areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/30,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,37,38</a>].

In one study of 14 US sporadic cases reported to the CDC, all patients had diarrhea (25 percent had bloody diarrhea), 71 percent had fever and 21 percent reported nausea and vomiting; the median duration of illness was 6.4 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, this probably represents the more severe end of the spectrum of illness: cases identified through outbreak investigations have been associated with less severe disease, with an incubation period of 12 to 24 hours and median duration of illness ranging from 12 to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> wound infections generally occur following exposure of wounds to seawater or brackish water; there have also been cases associated with non-saline water, including reports of necrotizing fasciitis caused by <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> strains linked to Austrian bathing sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Less commonly, strains have been implicated as a cause of otitis and pneumonia following near-drowning episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/34,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,42</a>]. While infection can occur in normal hosts, sepsis and severe wound infections occur almost exclusively among persons who are immunocompromised or have chronic underlying illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>Mortality rates for sepsis may range up to 40 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

As is true for <em>V. cholerae</em> strains associated with cholera, isolation of the microorganism from stool generally requires a selective media to suppress growth of other organisms, such as thiosulfate, citrate, bile salts, and sucrose (TCBS), on which <em>V. cholerae</em> appears as a typical yellow colony. The laboratory should be alerted regarding cases of diarrhea in which illness due to <em>V. cholerae</em> is suspected so that the appropriate media can be used. Species identification is based on standard biochemical tests. </p><p>All <em>V. cholerae</em> isolated require further characterization to determine, (a) if they carry the gene for cholera toxin, and (b) if they are in serogroups O1 or O139; such testing can generally be done in state health department laboratories or at the CDC. Strains that carry the gene for cholera toxin, but are not in O groups 1 or 139, will require further <span class=\"nowrap\">genetic/serologic</span> assessment to see if they might represent a cholera strain outside of the &quot;standard&quot; cholera serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-due-to-non-o1-o139-vibrio-cholerae/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In general, isolation of <em>V. cholerae</em> from a patient in the United States (or other resource-rich country) who lacks a history of travel to a cholera-endemic area will almost certainly represent a <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> strain of environmental origin. While these strains can cause serious disease in susceptible hosts, they do not represent the public health threat posed by toxigenic <span class=\"nowrap\">O1/O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume repletion is the most important element of therapy in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> gastroenteritis. In most cases, diarrhea is mild and self-limited. Antimicrobial therapy is reasonable in more severe cases, since antibiotic therapy is known to decrease the duration of diarrhea and the excretion of infectious organisms among patients with cholera. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholera-clinical-features-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention#H234666\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cholera: Clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>There are no controlled trials of therapy for gastroenteritis due to <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> strains. Based on clinical trials in cholera and in vitro susceptibility data, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is a reasonable antibiotic choice; alternatives include fluoroquinolones and macrolides. There are increasing reports of <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> strains having resistance to tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, so susceptibility testing should be done on all isolates to confirm that the antibiotic selection was appropriate. The duration of therapy depends on the antibiotic chosen, as outlined separately for cholera. </p><p>Wound infections require debridement and antimicrobial therapy. Mild wound infections in patients who do not have significant underlying diseases generally respond well to local wound care and oral antibiotics (such as a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> or a fluoroquinolone). Duration of therapy is dictated by clinical response; most patients respond to five to seven days of antibiotics. </p><p>Patients with septicemia or wound infections in the setting of risk factors for septicemia require aggressive antimicrobial therapy, frequently in an ICU setting. In the absence of data on antimicrobial therapy in sepsis due to <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em>, it would appear reasonable to follow the approach to choice of antibiotic therapy used for <em>V. vulnificus</em>, which causes a similar sepsis syndrome in immunocompromised patients. This includes combination therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg orally twice daily), plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> (2 g intravenously every eight hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (1 g intravenously daily). Depending on clinical response and the degree of the patient&rsquo;s immunosuppression, one to two weeks (or more) of antimicrobial therapy may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vibrio-vulnificus-infections#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vibrio vulnificus infections&quot;, section on 'Therapy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of infection from <span class=\"nowrap\">non-O1/non-O139</span> <em>V. cholerae</em> (as well as other <em>Vibrio</em> species) can be reduced by avoiding the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly during warm summer months. This is particularly important for individuals who are immunosuppressed or have serious underlying liver disease. Such individuals should also avoid exposure of wounds to estuarine waters; the increasing sea surface temperatures associated with global warming expand the northern range of where such infections might be expected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H888382771\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
