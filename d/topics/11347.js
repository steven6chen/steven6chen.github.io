These conditions are differentiated by their clinical features and age of presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57733\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57733 \">table 1</a>). The MPS can affect many different systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, skeletal, and neurologic systems. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available for some MPS. Other therapies focus on treatment of symptoms.</p><p>The complications associated with the MPS and their management are reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of these disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucopolysaccharidoses: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPIRATORY COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory complications affect patients with all types of MPS and contribute to death and disability as their disease progresses. Respiratory abnormalities result from airway obstruction, excessive secretions, skeletal restriction, organomegaly, frequent infections, and neurologic compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These problems can lead to progressive respiratory insufficiency, severe obstructive sleep apnea, and sudden death from central apnea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Central apnea from cord compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MPS IV A and IV B patients are especially prone to high cord compression due to atlantoaxial instability and odontoid dysplasia, although this complication also occurs in other types. This condition may result in depressed respiration or sudden respiratory arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Early cervical fusion is recommended in MPS IV patients and in other patients with cervical instability. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'C1-C2 subluxation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Odontoid hypoplasia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with MPS I, II, VI, and VII often develop upper airway obstruction due to an enlarged tongue, thickened gums, and engorged soft tissues of the nasopharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/1,2,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7-10</a>]. Increased tonsillar and adenoid size due to storage of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lymphatic tissue also contributes to obstruction. Upper airway obstruction may be exacerbated in certain positions (eg, raising the arms may result in obstruction of the thoracic inlet, causing facial plethora, distension of the neck veins, and shortness of breath) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Airway problems may be worsened by excessive thick secretions due to chronic or recurrent ear and sinus infections. Progressive obstruction can result in sleep apnea with severe hypoxemia and right heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/1,2,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms and predisposing factors for sleep-related breathing disorders in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tracheal or lower airway obstruction can result from malformed and floppy tracheal cartilage, redundant respiratory epithelium, or pedunculated nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/7,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14-16</a>]. Wheezing due to narrowed airways from increased mucus production and airway inflammation is common. In the setting of airway compromise, minor upper respiratory infections or pneumonia can cause severe reactive airway disease and airway edema. In patients with advanced disease, this may lead to sudden respiratory arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13850017\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interventions are primarily directed at maintaining a stable airway. Removal of the tonsils and adenoids can temporarily reduce airway obstruction and sleep apnea, but these problems often recur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/9,12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H2865702114\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'High-risk populations'</a>.)</p><p>Upper airway obstruction, especially when associated with sleep apnea, may be improved by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applied at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Younger patients seem to adapt better to CPAP than older ones. However, facial dysmorphism may make it difficult to achieve the proper fit of masks. Bilevel positive airway pressure ventilators (BiPAP devices), which decrease pressure during exhalation and increase pressure during inhalation, may be better tolerated by some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cpap-for-pediatric-obstructive-sleep-apnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;CPAP for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Supplemental oxygen at low flow rates can be used to treat arterial desaturation during sleep. However, oxygen therapy should be used with caution to avoid suppressing hypoxic respiratory drive. Patients with severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and sleep disturbance may require tracheotomy. Tracheotomy or tracheal T tubes are options in patients with signs of right heart failure and severe sleep apnea that cannot be improved with BiPAP or who have critical airway stenosis. If surgery or airway support with BiPAP is not possible, palliative care is given. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenotonsillectomy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children#H2865702493\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant surgical procedures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with MPS often have complications during general anesthesia. These are primarily due to the presence of airway obstruction, excessive secretions, a large tongue, and abnormal airway anatomy, resulting in extreme difficulty in endotracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/7,18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18-23</a>]. Older patients or those with sleep apnea or other signs of airway obstruction are at increased risk for difficult intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one report in 30 MPS patients who were anesthetized 141 times, preoperative signs of airway obstruction were present more often in patients with moderate to severe postoperative airway complications compared with those with mild or no complications (78 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Extension of the neck may cause spinal cord injury due to instability of the cervical spine, increasing the difficulty of intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>].</p><p>These problems should be weighed carefully in making decisions about surgical procedures. Anesthesia should be administered at centers experienced in the management of MPS patients. A comprehensive plan should be made before performing general anesthesia, including management options if complications develop. Local or regional anesthesia should be used whenever possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/7,18,19,23,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18,19,23,25,26</a>].</p><p>If general anesthesia is unavoidable, fiberoptic intubation with an endotracheal tube smaller than indicated by the patient's age or weight may help with airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/7,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27</a>]. Attempts to intubate without adequate visualization can lead to injury of the laryngeal tissue and airway edema.</p><p>Extubation may also be difficult in MPS patients. Glucocorticoids or other medications may be needed to reduce airway edema. In general though, earlier extubation is recommended if at all possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinopulmonary infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MPS patients have frequent or chronic pulmonary infections, otitis media, and sinusitis in the first few years after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/1,9,12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,12,17</a>]. The associated thick and copious secretions can worsen airway obstruction. Minor respiratory infections often progress to pneumonia with consolidation and require hospitalization.</p><p>Obstruction of the Eustachian tubes and sinus ostia contribute to the persistence of infections. Another possible mechanism for increased infection is abnormal immune function, which has been demonstrated in an animal model. T cell proliferative response and antibody production were decreased in a murine model of MPS VII after antigen challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Whether this occurs in humans with MPS is not known, although the frequency and severity of sinopulmonary infections are consistent with this finding.</p><p>The antimicrobial management of infections is similar to those without associated MPS. However, recovery time may be longer for MPS patients, and bronchodilators may be needed to treat reactive airway disease. Otitis media may also be more difficult to treat, and tympanostomy tubes may be required. Tube placement should be considered more readily than in patients without MPS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Initial antimicrobial therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Preventive measures include influenza vaccine in addition to standard childhood immunizations. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment has been used, especially during the winter, and nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a> has been used for prophylaxis in patients with tracheotomies. However, the efficacy of these approaches in MPS is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-immunizations-for-children-and-adolescents-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-with-vaccines#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention with vaccines&quot;, section on 'Target groups'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13850017\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with MPS also have pulmonary function abnormalities that can be multifactorial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. They are a clinically important cause of morbidity and mortality. However, many MPS patients have trouble performing traditional pulmonary function testing to the standard guidelines because they cannot blow out sufficiently for long periods of time, making assessment difficult.</p><p>The restrictive disease is most likely related to their skeletal abnormalities and enlarged liver and spleen and not to interstitial disease. Although obstructive disease may be less important, it is not uncommon for these patients to be treated with bronchodilators as part of their general care.</p><p>In one series of 35 patients with MPS I, II, IV A, or VI, 48 percent had restrictive lung disease based upon spirometry, and 9 percent had obstructive lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In another series, 12 of 15 patients with MPS II had a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) below 80 percent predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac abnormalities may result from the underlying MPS disorder or as a complication of severe pulmonary disease and associated chronic hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Cardiomyopathy and endocardial fibroelastosis occur rarely in young, severely affected patients with Hurler syndrome (MPS I) and MPS VI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Cardiac problems may be complicated by coronary artery and other vascular diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Valvular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive thickening of the mitral and aortic valves causing insufficiency occurs often in MPS, especially in types I, II, and VI, and less commonly in MPS III A to D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/2,9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,36</a>]. In one series of 84 MPS patients, mitral and aortic regurgitation were detected in 64 and 41 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Tricuspid and pulmonic valve regurgitation also occur and may be exacerbated by pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-regurgitation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aortic regurgitation in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although regurgitation can be detected in young patients, progressive worsening of valvular competence typically results in heart failure in late school age or in the teens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/1,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37,38</a>]. Severely affected patients may require valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>In patients with valvular insufficiency, systemic hypertension due to aortic coarctation and other vascular diseases can result in further compromise and should be treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. It is uncertain whether prophylactic afterload reduction is beneficial in patients with moderate regurgitation and without hypertension. This approach has been used successfully to treat the cardiovascular manifestations of Marfan syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Storage cells accumulate in the walls of arterial blood vessels, including the coronary arteries, leading to impaired flow and ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The coronary lesions involve the entire course of the vessels. Obstruction may result in sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Vigilance is required to detect coronary disease as it is usually unexpected in young children. Furthermore, the clinical presentation may not be typical, and coronary angiography may not predict the severity of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Intimal lesions can result in narrowing of the abdominal aorta, causing hypertension and poor perfusion of the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Arteriopathy also affects other vessels, including the renal, mesenteric, and iliac arteries.

Pulmonary hypertension may exacerbate right heart failure caused by mitral valve regurgitation. Therapy should be directed at maintaining a secure airway and avoiding hypoxemia, especially during the night.

This condition occurs in MPS I, II, IV, VI, and VII and is less extensive in MPS III and attenuated variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/2,9,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,45</a>]. The radiographic findings of dysostosis multiplex are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1831481035\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucopolysaccharidoses: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Radiologic findings'</a>.)</p><p>The bone disease in Morquio patients (MPS IV A and IV B) begins with ovoid vertebrae and typical features of dysostosis multiplex and progresses with age to appear similar to spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The ovoid vertebrae flatten and collapse, resulting in distinctive platyspondyly (thin, flat vertebral bodies). Abnormalities of the vertebral bodies can result in spinal instability and kyphoscoliosis. Deficient ossification of the superior acetabulum may result in progressive dislocation of the hip joint and erosions of the femoral neck. Joint replacement surgery is possible using a standard prosthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Odontoid hypoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoplasia or dysplasia of the odontoid (a tooth- or peg-like projection from the second cervical vertebra) is a characteristic finding in MPS IV A and IV B and is common in the severe forms of MPS I and VII. Hypoplasia is due in part to inadequate ossification, although reossification may occur after cervical fusion. Odontoid hypoplasia can lead to atlantoaxial instability, which can result in subluxation of the first and second cervical vertebrae (C1-C2 subluxation) and high spinal cord compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/3,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,48,49</a>].

The causes of kyphoscoliosis include dysplastic vertebral bodies (beaked vertebrae), subluxation (which results in part from ligamentous laxity), and compression or deformation of the vertebral bodies. Subluxation can compromise the cord at any level.</p><p>Patients with Hurler syndrome (MPS I) often develop a gibbus deformity of the lumbar spine, characterized by anterior wedging and posterior displacement of the vertebrae at the peak of the curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75426\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75426 \">picture 1</a>), resulting in a beaked appearance on lateral radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52046\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52046 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The causes of gibbus formation include incomplete ossification of the abnormal vertebrae, poor truncal tone, disturbed growth, anterior disc herniation, and weight bearing. Spondylolisthesis (forward slippage of the fifth lumbar vertebra [L5] over the first sacral vertebra [S1]) occurs in the majority of patients with less severe forms of MPS I.</p><p>Spinal fusion surgery may be required to stabilize the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/45,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,51</a>]. However, MPS patients may not heal well and often have complications from surgical procedures. Thus, fusion surgery should be performed only when absolutely necessary. The goal is to stabilize the spine with the minimum necessary intervention. Orthotic bracing may be used early on as a temporizing measure, allowing the patient to grow more before proceeding with definitive surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Genu valgum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities in the growth plates and epiphyses are caused by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) storage in the chondrocytes. In the knee, storage may lead to inadequate growth in the medial part of the tibial growth plate, causing genu valgum, or knock-knee deformity. This abnormality occurs in the majority of patients with MPS IV A and IV B but also can occur in other types. Severe cases require osteotomy and straightening procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Early operative intervention while the child is growing includes epiphysiodesis (fusion of the growth plate). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-knock-knees#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with knock-knees&quot;, section on 'Pathologic knock-knees'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Short stature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extensive skeletal abnormalities impair growth and result in short stature. Growth hormone resistance may also play a role in patients with MPS I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Although patients with severe MPS I may have accelerated growth in the first year, height attained is typically less than the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile. Less severely affected children may reach normal or near-normal heights. Patients with MPS II have accelerated growth in the first three years of life but subsequently have decreased growth velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The adolescent growth spurt occurs earlier in boys with MPS II. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) may improve growth in patients with MPS II, particularly if therapy is started before 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint stiffness and degenerative disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint stiffness associated with pain on movement occurs in nearly all MPS patients. The etiology of the stiffness includes inflammatory changes, engorgement of the synovial and other connective tissues of the joint, and abnormalities of the cartilage and epiphyseal bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. Pain and decreased movement can lead to development of contractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64899\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64899 \">picture 2</a>). This progression may be hastened in some patients by poor neurologic function.</p><p>Physical therapy can improve flexibility of the joints and help maintain function. However, it cannot prevent the inexorable decline in joint mobility. Wheelchairs are often needed for mobility, even in patients who can walk, because of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limited endurance. Animal studies suggest a possible therapeutic role for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists, but additional studies are necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Patients can develop painful and debilitating degenerative hip disease due to abnormalities in the femoral epiphyses. The optimal management for hip disease in MPS patients is unclear, and attempts to reach consensus have been challenging due to a poor evidence base and divergent practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Common approaches focus on exercise recommendations, physical therapy, adequate analgesia, and surgery where possible and probably provide functional benefit. There is anecdotal evidence for an increase in total hip replacements in adolescents and young adults with MPS diseases. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Ligamentous laxity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although lysosomal storage causes some joints to be stiff, GAG accumulation in ligaments can lead to laxity of other joints. This is seen most often in MPS IV A and IV B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Ligamentous laxity contributes to atlantoaxial instability and the development of kyphoscoliosis.

They may occur early on as part of the initial presentation and can become quite large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Hernias can also occur at the incision site following abdominal surgery. Hepatosplenomegaly may contribute to increased intra-abdominal pressure and lead to hernia formation.</p><p>Surgical repair of inguinal hernias often fails and needs to be repeated. Hepatosplenomegaly and the weak connective tissues may contribute to poor results. Thus, in some patients, management with trusses may be preferable to the risk of anesthesia and a surgical repair that is likely to be temporary. However, large umbilical hernias that occur in MPS I should be repaired when possible since their size can lead to breakdown of the overlying skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROLOGIC COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic complications can result from storage in cells in the brain; in supporting structures, such as the meninges or spinal column; or directly in sensory organs, such as the eye. Characteristic findings on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) include arachnoid cysts, enlarged cisterna magna, cerebellar hypoplasia, encephaloceles, and linear cyst-like structures in the subcortical white matter and corpus callosum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/64-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-70</a>]. These cysts are due to storage in the Virchow-Robin spaces around the blood vessels and are not associated with cognitive defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74009\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74009 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/65,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,71</a>]. Alterations of myelination may occur. Patients with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) can have significant ventriculomegaly, although some have minimal or no ventricular enlargement associated with transependymal fluid shifts in the periventricular areas.</p><p>Patients initially may be misdiagnosed as having idiopathic developmental delay, autism spectrum disorders, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Patients with MPS IV and VI usually have normal intellectual development. In Hurler syndrome (MPS I), delay that begins during the first year of life is often not appreciated until the second year. In most cases, affected children begin to walk and speak short sentences before reaching a developmental plateau. They then decline slowly so that the average intelligence quotient (IQ) is 50 by age three to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Hurler syndrome (MPS I) tend to be pleasant, good-natured children with excellent behavior during the early stages of the disease but often become unresponsive as the disease progresses to its final stages. In severe Hunter (MPS II) and Sanfilippo (MPS III) syndromes, developmental delay typically is noted at two to six years of age and is accompanied by hyperactive and aggressive behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/74,76-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,76-79</a>]. Patients have short attention spans, do not respond to instructions, and have no sense of danger. The aggressive behavior appears to improve with age as overall function progressively declines, usually reaching a neurologically devastated and unresponsive state in the early teenage years. Abnormal behavior in some patients may be caused by hydrocephalus with increased ICP, although the prevalence of this problem in MPS III is unknown. Patients with MPS II can have meningeal obstruction and high-pressure hydrocephalus, causing severe headaches that may in some cases worsen the behavior problems.</p><p>Management consists primarily of ensuring that the home environment is safe. Attempts to treat the abnormal behavior with medications have been limited by their side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/62,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,80</a>]. Medications that are sometimes used include neuroleptics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">olanzapine</a>), which may cause excessive sedation; benzodiazepines, which may increase secretions and cause respiratory compromise in patients with airway problems, bulbar palsy, and decreased swallowing; tricyclic antidepressants; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoxetine</a>), which should be avoided in patients with seizures; and anticonvulsants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carbamazepine</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Methylphenidate</a> is usually not helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures may occur in Hunter (MPS II) and Sanfilippo (MPS III) syndromes but are rarely seen in other MPS disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Electroencephalographic data in a few MPS patients with seizures demonstrate irregular slow wave activity and typical epileptiform discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/64,76,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,76,82</a>].

Sleep becomes progressively fragmented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>], and patients become active around the clock.</p><p>A padded bedroom is usually required to keep the child contained and avoid injury during the night. Restraints are generally not effective. Medications, including melatonin or sedatives, may improve sleep. Melatonin is estimated to be successful in approximately 75 percent of patients within three to four days of use. The authors start with a dose of 2 to 3 mg and increase if necessary after one to two weeks to 4 to 6 mg, with further increases as clinically indicated. Children with MPS frequently require treatment with the maximum dose of 10 mg. Melatonin is used with a strict regimen of sleep time and a darkened bedroom. Benzodiazepines or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloral-hydrate-united-states-not-available-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chloral hydrate</a> may also be tried.</p><p>Sleep disturbances contribute to exhaustion of the caretakers.

In MPS I, II, VI, and VII, the mechanism is engorgement of the arachnoid granulations by storage material, impeding resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and increasing ICP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75849\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75849 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. In MPS III patients, ventricular enlargement may be due to hydrocephalus but more commonly is due to atrophy in the later stages of the illness. Acute increases in ICP may present with severe headaches, visual disturbances, altered mental status, and rapidly progressive developmental decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. However, the process may be insidious and without typical signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/45,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,89</a>]. Papilledema is not a reliable indicator and is often not present in patients with increased ICP. Swelling of the optic nerve head is frequently a precursor of optic atrophy, rather than a sign of increased ICP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/45,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,90</a>]. Another diagnostic pitfall is the interpretation of modest ventriculomegaly seen on MRI as cerebral atrophy rather than high-pressure communicating hydrocephalus.</p><p>The diagnosis of hydrocephalus is confirmed by lumbar puncture with measurement of opening pressure. The disorder is usually managed by placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical cord compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compression of the cervical spinal cord can result from pachymeningitis cervicalis or vertebral subluxation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Pachymeningitis cervicalis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pachymeningitis cervicalis is the progressive thickening and scarring of the meninges around the cervical spinal cord caused by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) storage in MPS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58332%7EPEDS%2F72193\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58332 graphicRef72193 \">image 4A-B</a>). The thickened meninges may form a tight sleeve around the spinal cord that impedes the flow of CSF and progressively compresses the cervical cord. This process may be compounded by a spinal canal that has been narrowed by bone disease. Pachymeningitis cervicalis was originally described in Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (MPS VI) but has been reported in MPS I, II, and VII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-93</a>].</p><p>The clinical course is insidious. Patients may complain of fatigue in their legs and gradually have decreased movement and prefer sedentary activities. Occasional &quot;buckling&quot; of the knees may be attributed to a joint problem. Patients typically present to the clinician for evaluation as weakness or sensory loss becomes more evident. The constellation of motor and sensory defects depends upon the extent and location of the compression and may affect breathing or bowel and bladder control.</p><p>Management of this condition is difficult. The pressure can often be relieved by laminectomy with incision and removal of meningeal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/91,94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,94-96</a>]. In patients with accompanying subluxation, fusion of the vertebrae is needed. Surgical treatment may be the only option in many cases. However, these procedures have high surgical and anesthesia risks and may not offer significant benefit in some patients. To prevent serious cervical cord accidents in these patients, it is extremely important to assure that the neck is appropriately protected at all times and is not flexed or extended during intubation or surgery. Presurgical conferences to discuss management with the anesthesiologist and surgeon are necessary to assure that the neck is protected during surgical decompression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">C1-C2 subluxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Odontoid dysplasia and ligamentous laxity can result in subluxation of the first cervical vertebra (C1) on the second cervical vertebra (C2) and cause cord compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/49,97-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,97-100</a>]. The instability and frequent movement may impair ossification of the odontoid and result in thickened fibrocartilaginous tissue anterior to the cord, causing further compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/3,5,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,101</a>]. This problem is common in MPS IV A and IV B but also occurs in MPS I, VI, and VII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/3,64,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,64,102</a>].</p><p>Cord compression due to subluxation is often anterior and predominantly causes motor dysfunction. Onset of motor dysfunction can be insidious, with slowly progressive and nonspecific fatigue followed by decreased activity and preference for sedentary play. If untreated, the cord compression can result in progressive ascending paresis and paralysis. Compression can be visualized with MRI and cord injury confirmed by the presence of abnormal T2-weighted signal in the cord. Somatosensory evoked potentials of the median or posterior tibial nerves have been used to evaluate functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p>Management includes posterior cervical fusion to stabilize the neck and reduce cord compression injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/3,20,96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20,96,97</a>]. Concomitant decompression of excess tissue anterior to the cord may be needed. This procedure should be performed early in MPS IV A and IV B to avoid sudden high cord compression and respiratory arrest following a minor fall in those patients with radiologic instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-complications/abstract/3,5,104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,104,105</a>]. Surgery should be performed at centers experienced in the management of MPS. To prevent serious cervical cord accidents in these patients, it is extremely important to assure that the neck is appropriately protected at all times and is not flexed or extended during intubation or surgery. Other MPS patients, especially those with MPS I and MPS VII, should be evaluated with annual radiographs in flexion and extension as well as MRI scans. If cervical instability is present, fusion should be performed.
