Presentations due to cortical syndromes such as aphasia or visual field disturbances are possible, though much less common. Presenting symptoms and signs may be either monofocal (consistent with a single lesion) or multifocal (consistent with more than one lesion). Approximately 5 to 10 percent of adult patients have the primary progressive form of MS, which presents with gradual accumulation of disability from the onset, without superimposed acute relapses. The most common clinical presentation of primary progressive MS is a spinal cord syndrome with spastic paraparesis and no clear sensory level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis#H605008275\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical course and classification of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Disease pattern'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A relapse (also called an attack or exacerbation) is defined as the acute or subacute onset of clinical dysfunction typical of an acute inflammatory demyelinating event in the central nervous system, in the absence of fever or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Symptoms and signs associated with a relapse usually reach a peak in days to several weeks, followed by a remission during which the symptoms and signs resolve to a variable extent. The minimum duration for a relapse has been arbitrarily established at 24 hours, though most are much longer. Clinical symptoms of shorter duration are less likely to represent new lesion formation or extension of previous lesion size. </p><p>Analysis of prospectively collected data from a cohort of 195 patients suggests that symptomatic demyelinating events in early relapsing-remitting MS have a tendency to recur in the same location (eg, spinal cord, optic nerve, brainstem) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, relapses can present with any of the typical clinical symptoms of MS, and there are no specific clinical features that can reliably distinguish the initial clinical attack of MS from a relapse, other than history. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical symptoms and signs'</a> below.)</p><p>In the absence of a new demyelinating event, previous clinical deficits may worsen in the setting of fever (see <a href=\"#H392245186\" class=\"local\">'Heat sensitivity'</a> below), physical activity, high environmental temperature, or metabolic upset, and may last for hours to a day or more. Such worsening, termed &quot;pseudorelapses&quot; is thought to reflect conduction block in previously demyelinated axons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no clinical findings that are unique to MS, but some are highly characteristic of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63940 \">table 2</a>). Common symptoms of MS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61789 \">table 3</a>) include sensory symptoms in the limbs or one side of the face, visual loss, acute or subacute motor weakness, diplopia, gait disturbance and balance problems, Lhermitte sign (electric shock-like sensations that run down the back <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limbs upon flexion of the neck), vertigo, bladder problems, limb ataxia, acute transverse myelitis, and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The onset is often polysymptomatic. The most common presenting symptoms are sensory disturbances, followed by weakness and visual disturbances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2851516956\"><span class=\"h2\">Bowel and bladder dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 percent of patients with MS report bowel dysfunction and up to 75 percent report bladder dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The extent of sphincter and sexual dysfunction often parallels the degree of motor impairment in the lower extremities. The most frequent urinary complaint is urgency, which is usually the result of uninhibited detrusor contraction due to a suprasegmental lesion. </p><p>Urinary incontinence becomes more common as the disease progresses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;, section on 'Urinary complications'</a>.)</p><p>Neurogenic bladder dysfunction in MS can be categorized according to the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, which generally lead to failure of the bladder to empty or store urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detrusor overactivity (ie, overactive bladder), leading to failure of the bladder to store urine. The resulting symptoms include urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. Detrusor overactivity is the most common urologic abnormality affecting patients with MS, and is typically caused by cortical demyelinating lesions that impair the detrusor reflex at the level of the frontal cortex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, the term used to describe detrusor contraction without urethral sphincter relaxation, leading to functional bladder outlet obstruction and failure to empty, typically caused by lesions involving the pontine micturition center or spinal cord lesions above the sacral parasympathetic centers. Associated symptoms include hesitancy, interrupted stream, and incomplete voiding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inefficient bladder contractility, leading to failure of the bladder to empty, and attributed to lesions spinal cord lesions that disrupt coordination with the pontine micturition center. Related symptoms include incomplete emptying, residual urine, and frequency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal sensation and bladder hypoactivity due to involvement of sacral segments of the spinal cord, leading to failure to empty (ie, an atonic dilated bladder that empties by overflow); this condition results from loss of perception of bladder fullness, and it is usually associated with urethral, anal, and genital hypesthesia, and sensory deficits in the sacral dermatomes. Symptoms include urinary retention, interrupted micturition, and incomplete bladder emptying.</p><p/><p>While these can exist in isolation, many patients with MS have several concurrent types of bladder dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Neurogenic bowel dysfunction in patients with MS can be divided into disorders of storage and elimination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These problems may be a result of both upper and lower motor neuron impairment. Constipation, poor evacuation, and incontinence are the most common bowel disorders associated with MS, in that order. One study of 221 patients with MS found that 54 percent had constipation while 29 percent experienced fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2500759987\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frank dementia is an uncommon feature of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], occurring in fewer than 5 percent of patients. It is usually only encountered in severely affected individuals. However, when evaluated with neuropsychological tests, up to 70 percent of patients have some cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The prevalence of cortical syndromes such as aphasia, apraxia, and agnosia is low.</p><p>Cognitive impairment may be common even at the onset of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The most frequent abnormalities are in attention, executive functioning, abstract conceptualization, short term memory, word recall, and speed of information processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Different disease courses may have different cognitive profiles. As an example, there is evidence that patients with relapsing-remitting MS generally have better cognitive performance than patients with progressive types of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Of note, subtle alterations in cognitive functioning may remain unidentified during routine office practice, notwithstanding the application of rapid assessment tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) tools. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;, section on 'Cognitive testing'</a>.)</p><p>The degree of cognitive decline in patients with MS correlates with the severity of cerebral pathology and lesion burden on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/13,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17-20</a>], including the persistence of T1 black holes (signifying loss of tissue architecture), and atrophy of the corpus callosum and thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/17-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-25</a>]. Cortical atrophy as measured by MRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58083\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58083 \">image 1</a>) correlates with cognitive changes, suggesting that gray as well as white matter atrophy may contribute to the cognitive decline in patients with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>].</p><p>Depression frequently has a negative impact on cognition, particularly on memory, attention, and concentration (see <a href=\"#H3045694797\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> below). Depression, lack of social support, and the presence of cognitive impairment have been shown to correlate with one another, independent of level of physical disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Depression is also correlated with use of less effective coping styles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These relationships are likely quite complex and interactive.</p><p>The ability of severe clinical depression to reduce performance on neuropsychological measures is well established in healthy controls and in patients with known risk factors for cognitive dysfunction, such as those with traumatic brain injury. In patients with MS, a number of cognitive domains related to executive functioning may be especially vulnerable to depression. These domains include working memory, planning ability, information processing speed, and nonspeeded central executive skill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Thus, depression likely contributes to cognitive dysfunction in patients with MS, which in turn leads to impaired problem solving and poor coping in real world situations, where people have to make flexible and instantaneous coping choices.</p><p>Acute cerebral lesions occasionally manifest as a confusional state associated with progressive focal paralysis. These findings can be mistakenly attributed to a tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The management of cognitive impairment in MS is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptom-management-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptom management of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Cognitive impairment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3045694797\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cross-sectional studies have shown some degree of affective disturbance in up to two-thirds of patients with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Depression may be more common in patients with MS than in others with chronic medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/27,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,34</a>]. In addition, the risk of suicide in patients with MS may be increased in comparison with the general population, as shown in most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] studies. The median life expectancy in patients with MS is reduced by about 5 to 10 years compared with that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]; suicide probably has only a small effect on this diminution.</p><p>Some of the numerous medical and psychiatric comorbidities that contribute to depression in MS are pain, anxiety, fatigue, substance abuse, and cognitive impairment; conversely, depression appears to have a major deleterious impact on cognitive function in patients with MS. (See <a href=\"#H2500759987\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive impairment'</a> above.)</p><p>Early trials suggested that treatment with an interferon beta may contribute to the development or unmasking of depression, but subsequent studies have not found such an association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].</p><p>The management of depression in patients with MS is reviewed elsewhere.

Approximately two-thirds of seizures in patients with MS are primary or secondary generalized seizures, while the remaining one-third are partial. Simple partial seizures are about twice as common as complex partial seizures in patients with MS. This differs from the general population, where complex partial seizures are more frequent than simple partial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Seizures associated with MS are generally are benign and transient and respond well to antiepileptic drug therapy or require no therapy.

INO is caused by a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the brainstem on the side of diminished adduction. Convergence is typically preserved. When present bilaterally, it is usually coupled with vertical nystagmus on upward gaze. A bilateral INO is most suggestive of MS but can also be observed with other intraaxial brainstem lesions, including brainstem glioma, vascular lesions, Arnold-Chiari malformations, and Wernicke encephalopathy.

Patients frequently complain of oscillopsia, which impairs visual performance. Marked impairment of visual acuity may also be present, due in part to blurring from constant eye motion and perhaps also to concurrent optic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2099988758\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is a characteristic finding in MS, usually described as physical exhaustion that is unrelated to the amount of activity performed. The impact of fatigue is suggested by the findings of a survey of 223 patients with MS; fatigue was the most common currently experienced symptom (86 percent), and it was rated as the worst symptom causing difficulty or distress by 65 percent, higher than any other symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Fatigue interferes with daily activities.</p><p>Primary MS-related fatigue typically occurs daily and worsens as the day goes on. Many patients complain of feeling exhausted on waking, even if they have slept soundly. Fatigue can also occur during the day but may be partially or completely relieved by rest. It is often aggravated by heat and humidity. This is considered to be due to slowing of neuronal conduction with increased body temperature (see <a href=\"#H392245186\" class=\"local\">'Heat sensitivity'</a> below). In addition, there appears to be a correlation between fatigue and disrupted sleep in MS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>Fatigue is often seen in association with an acute MS attack and may precede the focal neurologic features of the attack and persist long after the attack has subsided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In addition, fatigue has been correlated with measures of cerebral axonal injury, implying a central nervous system component to the development of fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Transient increases in the frequency or severity of clinical signs and symptoms as a result of elevated body temperature are experienced by 60 to 80 percent of individuals with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The temporary worsening of neurologic signs and symptoms of MS in response to heat exposure can diminish physical and cognitive function of affected patients with MS, and impede activities of daily living and other functional capabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>This phenomenon is presumably the result of conduction block developing in central pathways as the body temperature increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Normally, the nerve conduction safety factor decreases with increasing temperature until a point is reached at which conduction block occurs; this point of conduction block is reached at a much lower temperature in demyelinated nerves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3269342012\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with MS, paraparesis or paraplegia are more common than isolated upper extremity weakness due to the frequent occurrence of lesions in the descending motor tracts of the spinal cord. Severe spasticity can occur, such that extensor spasms of the legs and sometimes the trunk may be provoked by active or passive attempts to rise from a bed or wheelchair.</p><p>Physical findings include spasticity, usually more marked in the legs than in the arms. The deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated, sustained clonus may be elicited, and extensor plantar responses are observed. All of these manifestations are commonly asymmetrical.</p><p>Occasionally, deep tendon reflexes are decreased due to lesions interrupting the reflex arc at a segmental level, and an inverted triceps reflex may be observed. In it, the triceps contraction is lost and the efferent component is represented by a contraction of the biceps muscle. The Achilles reflex can be absent due to lesions of the sacral segments of the spinal cord, with or without concomitant sphincter and sexual problems. Occasionally, reduced reflexes reflect hypotonia resulting from cerebellar pathway lesions.</p><p>Amyotrophy can occur and is usually of the disuse type, most frequently affecting the small muscles of the hand. Less commonly, lesions of the motor root exit zones cause muscle denervation due to axon loss. Secondary entrapment neuropathies are also a cause of muscle atrophy in MS.</p><p>Brainstem-related symptoms like dysphagia, dysarthria, and respiratory dysfunction (particularly poor cough and inability to clear secretions) can occur in advanced MS disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2291163918\"><span class=\"h3\">Incoordination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gait imbalance, difficulty in performing coordinated actions with the arms and hands, and slurred speech often occur as a result of impairment of cerebellar pathways.

They are likely caused by ephaptic transmission of nerve impulses at sites of previous disease activity. Although troublesome to the patient, these symptoms do not indicate a true exacerbation of MS or cause a loss of myelin in the central nervous system.</p><p>Within the brainstem, lesions may cause paroxysmal diplopia, facial paresthesia, trigeminal neuralgia, ataxia, and dysarthria. Motor system involvement results in painful tonic spasms of muscles of one or two (homolateral) limbs, trunk, and occasionally the face, but these only rarely occur in all four limbs or the trunk. These paroxysmal attacks typically respond to low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> and frequently remit after several weeks to months, usually without recurrence.

The sensory features can reflect spinothalamic, posterior column, or dorsal root entry zone lesions. Symptoms are commonly described as numbness, tingling, pins-and-needles, tightness, coldness, or swelling of the limbs or trunk. Radicular pains also can be present, particularly in the low thoracic and abdominal regions. An intense itching sensation, especially in the cervical dermatomes and usually unilateral, is suggestive of MS.</p><p>The most common sensory abnormalities on clinical examination include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Varying degrees of impairment of vibration and joint position sense</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased pain and light touch perception in a distal distribution in the four extremities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patchy areas of reduced pain and light touch perception in the limbs and trunk</p><p/><p>Upon testing sensation with a sharp object such as a pin, patients frequently report that the sharp feeling is increased, or that it feels like a mild electric shock, or that the stimulus spreads in a ripple fashion from the point at which it is applied. A bilateral sensory level is more common than a hemisensory syndrome. The latter is termed a Brown-S&eacute;quard syndrome when it is coupled with contralateral weakness.

This is followed by a variable degree of visual loss (scotoma) affecting mainly central vision. Bilateral simultaneous optic neuritis is rare in MS; its occurrence in isolation may suggest another diagnosis such as Leber hereditary optic atrophy, toxic optic neuropathy, or neuromyelitis optica&nbsp;(NMO) spectrum disease. When bilateral optic neuritis occurs in patients with MS, the impairment begins asymmetrically and is usually more severe in one eye.</p><p>Physical examination of patients with optic neuritis reveals a relative afferent pupillary defect (Marcus-Gunn pupil), which is evaluated with the swinging flashlight test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71937\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71937 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F102285\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102285 \">picture 1</a>). When the acute optic neuritis lesion involves the head of the optic nerve, disc edema may be observed on fundus examination, a finding more common in children than in adults. Most often the lesion of the optic nerve is retrobulbar, and in the acute stage fundus examination is normal. Later the optic disc becomes pale as a result of axonal loss and resultant gliosis. This pallor predominates in the temporal segment of the disc (temporal pallor).</p><p>Ninety percent of patients regain normal vision over a period of two to six months after an acute episode of optic neuritis. Desaturation of bright colors, particularly red, is often reported by recovered patients; some also report a mild nonspecific dimming.
