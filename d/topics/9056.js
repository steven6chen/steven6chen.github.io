By this definition, it may pertain to many biological actions of insulin in many tissues of the body. Typically, however, in clinical practice, insulin resistance refers to a state in which a given concentration of insulin is associated with a subnormal glucose response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The term first came into use several years after the introduction of insulin therapy in 1922 to describe occasional diabetic patients who required increasingly large doses of insulin to control hyperglycemia. Most of these patients developed insulin resistance secondary to antibodies directed against the therapeutic insulin, which at that time was both impure and derived from non-human species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Antiinsulin antibodies are rare in patients treated with recombinant human insulin, and the spectrum of clinical disorders in which insulin resistance plays a major role has changed markedly. Insulin resistance, rather than being a rare complication of the treatment of diabetes, is now recognized as a component of several disorders, including the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75383 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme insulin-resistance syndromes, such as the type B syndrome with autoantibodies against the insulin receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and rare inherited disorders, such as Leprechaunism with insulin-receptor mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and the lipodystrophic states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity, stress, infection, uremia, acromegaly, glucocorticoid excess, and pregnancy, which cause secondary insulin resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common disorders such as the metabolic syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and ovarian hyperthecosis, in which the mechanism of the associated hyperinsulinemia is unknown.

In practice, we measure serum insulin only when evaluating patients with clinical features of extreme insulin resistance. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical spectrum'</a> below.)</p><p>To confirm the diagnosis, it is also necessary to determine that the structure and biological activity of the patient's insulin are normal. There are rare cases of mutations in the insulin gene resulting in the production of insulin that has subnormal bioactivity but normal immunoactivity. These insulins circulate at high concentrations, simulating insulin resistance, but the response to exogenous insulin is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance to exogenous insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A reduced response to exogenous insulin is readily evident in insulin-treated diabetic patients who require higher doses to prevent hyperglycemia, even though the insulin dose in a given patient is an imperfect means for quantitating the degree of insulin resistance. However, most patients with insulin resistance (such as those with obesity) are not treated with insulin. In them, resistance to exogenous insulin can be assessed and quantified by techniques such as the intravenous glucose tolerance test, the insulin suppression test, or the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. With the latter, insulin-induced glucose uptake is measured while blood glucose concentration is maintained at a steady concentration (via exogenous dextrose infusion) to avoid the confounding effects of counterregulatory hormones such as epinephrine and glucagon&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69265 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemical markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a clinical setting, it would be useful to identify obese patients who are insulin resistant, as they are at highest risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and certain malignancies associated with obesity and insulin resistance (eg, colon, breast, and endometrial cancers). However, there is currently no validated test for measuring insulin resistance in a clinical setting.</p><p>In a research setting, the euglycemic insulin clamp technique has been considered to be the gold standard, and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the insulin tolerance test <span class=\"nowrap\">(ITT)/insulin</span> suppression test are the tests most frequently used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, these techniques are impractical for routine clinical use.</p><p>In nondiabetic, normotensive overweight individuals, serum triglyceride concentration, the ratio of triglyceride to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, and fasting insulin concentration are useful markers for identifying those who may be insulin resistant (as measured by an insulin suppression test). Optimal cut-points were identified as 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.47 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> 3.0 (1.8 SI units), and 15.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;U/mL</span> (109 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> for triglycerides, triglyceride-to HDL ratio, and insulin, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sensitivity and specificity for the cut-points were 67, 64, and 57 percent, respectively, and 71, 68, and 85 percent, respectively.</p><p>In large population epidemiology studies, simple ratios derived from fasting insulin and glucose (eg, glucose to insulin ratios, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR or HOMA]) have been extensively used. There are limitations to their use, including changes in beta cell function over time, lack of a standardized universal insulin assay, and lack of data demonstrating that markers of insulin resistance predict response to treatment. As a result, although indexes such as HOMA, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), etc, have been proposed and cut-points identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], none are recommended for routine assessment of insulin resistance in the clinic.</p><p>The co-segregation of overall obesity (increased body mass index [BMI]) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal obesity (increased waist circumference), increased blood pressure, increased fasting glucose and triglyceride levels, and low HDL suggests the existence of the metabolic syndrome, which is very closely related with insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X)&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SPECTRUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin resistance can present in a variety of ways. Hyperglycemia despite large doses of insulin is the classical presentation, but many patients with extreme resistance to insulin do not have overt hyperglycemia. However, nearly all such patients have one or more clinical features suggesting the presence of severe insulin resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73294\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73294 \">table 2</a>). These features include acanthosis nigricans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53776\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53776 \">picture 1</a>), ovarian hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovary syndrome [PCOS]), lipodystrophy, accelerated or impaired linear growth, autoimmunity, and muscle cramps. The presence of severe features should lead to measurement of serum insulin. A finding of hyperinsulinemia should prompt further studies to evaluate the presence of circulating anti-insulin receptor antibodies and the other disorders listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75383 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In most cases, the precise basis for the link between insulin resistance and these clinical findings is not yet identified. It is likely that high serum insulin concentrations over-stimulate specific insulin-responsive pathways that are less impaired than those affecting glucose transport. This may occur via activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptors or hybrid receptors formed by covalent linkage of subunits of the homologous receptors for insulin and IGF-1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61896\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61896 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal glucose metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose homeostasis varies from extremely abnormal (either diabetes or hypoglycemia) to normal. At one end of the spectrum are insulin-treated diabetic patients who require large doses of insulin to control serum glycemia. Insulin resistance in these patients may be induced by the production of antiinsulin antibodies or autoantibodies directed against the insulin receptor. Next in the spectrum are patients with overt diabetes who are not receiving insulin, such as most patients with type 2 diabetes in whom there is also a component of impaired pancreatic beta cell function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, many patients with insulin resistance have normal or only slightly high blood glucose concentrations. Included in this group are most patients with obesity, many patients with hypertension and hyperandrogenism, and those with inherited syndromes of severe insulin resistance such as the Type A syndrome. Some patients with insulin resistance due to autoantibodies against the insulin receptor actually have hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Acanthosis nigricans is a skin lesion characterized by brown, velvety, hyperkeratotic plaques. The lesions are usually found on the back of the neck, the axilla (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53776\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53776 \">picture 1</a>), the groin, and over the elbows, but they may cover the entire surface of the skin, sparing only the palms and soles. The lesions may be papillomatous. Histological hallmarks are hyperkeratosis, epidermal papillomatosis, and increased numbers of melanocytes.</p><p>The common denominator in all cases of acanthosis nigricans, with the possible exception of tumor-induced lesions, is insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It may vary in severity and may be inherited or acquired. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acanthosis-nigricans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acanthosis nigricans&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperandrogenism and reproductive abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men with insulin resistance are not known to have disorders of the reproductive system. In contrast, women with insulin resistance commonly present with reproductive abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>As an example, most women with severe tissue resistance to insulin, regardless of cause, have marked hyperandrogenism. This association has been described in women with the Type B syndrome (caused by insulin-receptor autoantibodies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] or the Type A syndrome (caused by genetic defects in the insulin-signaling system, such as mutations in the insulin-receptor gene) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/3,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,18</a>]. Affected women can present with overt virilization or hirsutism, amenorrhea, and infertility. The ovary shows the histologic changes of hyperthecosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Most women with ovarian hyperandrogenism have tissue resistance to insulin that is identified by fasting hyperinsulinemia or subnormal insulin-mediated glucose uptake (from euglycemic clamp studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The molecular basis for the tissue resistance to insulin in these women is not known. Studies in cultured skin fibroblasts suggest that approximately 50 percent of them have a defect in phosphorylation of the insulin receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The basis for the association between insulin resistance and ovarian hyperandrogenism is not known, and there is no clear correlation between the severity of the two disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. While androgen excess can cause a modest reduction of insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], the primary abnormality is probably insulin resistance, which in some way causes the ovarian abnormality. Insulin receptors, and the closely related receptors for IGF-1, are present on ovarian cells and stimulation of these receptors increases androgen production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Reducing insulin resistance by the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> or a thiazolidinedione lowers serum free testosterone concentrations and reduces cytochrome P450c17 (17-hydroxylase) activity in the ovaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

There are, however, two pediatric disorders with severe insulin resistance, Leprechaunism and the Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, in which growth is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Leprechaunism is due to a complete or nearly complete absence of insulin-receptor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and is associated with markedly delayed linear growth and failure to thrive.</p><p>Pseudoacromegaly, in contrast, is a syndrome in which severe insulin resistance is associated with accelerated linear growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In these patients, hyperinsulinemia probably promotes linear growth by activating skeletal IGF-1 receptors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with severe tissue resistance to insulin have muscle cramps unrelated to exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

High serum free fatty acid concentrations in the circulation, either derived from enlarged adipose cells (the storage capacity of which has been exceeded) or because there is not enough storage space in the adipose tissue of lipodystrophic subjects, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Increased release of adipocytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, or decreased production of protective adipocytokines, such as adiponectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], are thought to mediate the effects of obesity in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, and subsequently, the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Role of diet, obesity, and inflammation'</a>.)</p><p>The lipodystrophy syndromes are a clinically diverse group of disorders characterized by an unusual amount and distribution of adipose tissue. The patients often have severe tissue resistance to insulin and may have some of the other clinical features of insulin resistance, such as acanthosis nigricans. The syndromes can be congenital or acquired, and atrophy of adipose tissue can be total or partial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Administration of leptin to these subjects, in the context of open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled clinical trials, has been shown to potentially improve several of their metabolic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].
