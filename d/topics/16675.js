Chronic edema is managed medically by treating the underlying disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H802880404\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The following preoperative assessments are performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assess the degree of lymphedema </strong>&ndash; The circumference of the affected extremity is compared to the unaffected limb to document the degree of lymphedema. Measurements are taken at fixed intervals at specific anatomic sites (eg, ankle, mid-calf, knee, mid thigh for lower extremity measurements), although there may be significant inter-examiner variability with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Multiple measurements along the extremity can also be used to calculate limb volumes using the truncated cone formula. Volumetric measurement using water displacement is the most accurate assessment tool, but is cumbersome to perform, provides variable results when compression garments are used or there are changes in patient activity, and hence, is rarely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Perometry (optoelectronic), a technique that utilizes infrared light, can estimate cross-sectional measurements at multiple intervals and convert this information into limb volume metrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The degree of lymphedema at other sites is performed by measuring the affected area. In our practice, we measure limb circumference at two points: above and below a major joint in addition to perometry. For example, in assessing upper-extremity lymphedema, the circumference is measured 10 cm above and 5 cm below the olecranon on both the affected and unaffected limb.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphedema stage </strong>&ndash; Staging of lymphedema is typically performed using the Campisi staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81911\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81911 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Alternatively, the staging system of the International Society of Lymphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] or National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] can be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H182331057\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Clinical stage'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Venous duplex ultrasound</strong> &ndash; For patients who will undergo a physiologic procedure, ultrasound is performed to rule out venous thrombosis, venous insufficiency, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> valvular incompetence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186726312\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Operative management of lymphedema is categorized into two general approaches: physiologic techniques and reductive techniques. Physiologic procedures are used for patients with early stage lymphedema prior to deposition of excess fat and extensive tissue fibrosis (eg, Campisi stage I, II, or early stage III) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81911\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81911 \">table 1</a>). By contrast, reductive techniques are indicated when patients present with more advanced lymphedema after fat deposition and tissue fibrosis has occurred (eg, Campisi stage III or IV). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186726319\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiological techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physiologic techniques create new channels to increase the capacity of the lymphatic system to transport lymph fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The fluids trapped in lymphedematous tissues are drained into other lymphatic basins or into the venous circulation. In general, surgical intervention is feasible as long as tissue changes in the affected limb (eg, fibrosis, fat hypertrophy) are not severe. Patients with more advanced lymphedema have been treated with physiologic techniques, however, the results are variable, and only limited numbers of patients have been analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>The surgical approaches to accomplish this goal include lymphatic bypass procedures, flap transposition procedures, and vascularized lymph node transfers. The lymphatic bypass procedures are the most commonly used of the physiological techniques. These procedures require a high level of technical skill, and performance of these procedures should be reserved for those surgeons who have expertise in microvascular surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4258367\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphatic bypass procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphatic bypass procedures are used in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of nonoperative management (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H517749948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Overview of management'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent cellulitis or lymphangitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissatisfaction with compression garments or impaired quality of life</p><p/><p>Contraindications to lymphatic bypass procedures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive tissue fibrosis </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late stage lymphedema changes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H182331057\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Clinical stage'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent cancer in the ipsilateral extremity or metastatic disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient noncompliance with compression therapy or postoperative care plans </p><p/><p>Primary or secondary forms of lymphedema can be treated with this approach, although the efficacy of these procedures in primary lymphedema has been debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/4,7,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,29,30</a>]. The lymphatic bypass procedures are categorized as lymphatic-lymphatic bypass and lymphovenous bypass procedures. Lymphaticovenular bypass procedures are a variation of the lymphovenous approach. </p><p>The basic principle is that the lymphatic vessels distal to the lymphatic obstruction are anastomosed to healthy lymphatic vessels or veins proximal to the obstruction. For example, when the lymphatics are transected at the level of the axilla, a bypass is created by connecting the distal lymphatic vessels in the upper arm to vessels (veins or lymph) proximal to the axillary obstruction. An alternative technique involves using a vein graft harvested from another anatomic site and used as the conduit between transected lymphatic vessels and a draining regional vein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4258819\"><span class=\"h4\">Methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several methods used to perform a bypass procedure. There is no consensus for the specific type of lymphatic bypass procedure to be performed; these decisions are made based on surgeon preference and experience. To help identify the lymphatic vessels, prior to making an incision, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosulfan-blue-dye-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosulfan blue dye</a> is injected into the subcutaneous tissue distal to the operative site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The most common approaches are described as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphatic-lymphatic</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> &ndash; Lympholymphatic bypass transfers soft tissue resected from an unaffected site to a site that is proximal to that affected by lymphedema and followed by a direct anastomosis of the lymphatic vessels. As an example, soft tissues containing lymphatic vessels can be harvested from the anterior thigh and transferred as a graft to the upper third of the arm where proximal and distal collecting lymphatics are identified and microsurgically anastomosed to the donor lymphatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphovenous</strong> <strong>bypass</strong> &ndash; Lymphovenous bypass is an alternative to the lymphatic-lymphatic technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/19,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,34,35</a>]. A vein interposition graft is used to connect the distal lymphatic vessels with vessels proximal to the obstruction. Proximal vessels used in this technique include lymphatic vessels, adjacent veins, or deeper and larger veins. Multiple lymphatic vessels can be anastomosed to the vein graft. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphaticovenular</strong> <strong>anastomosis</strong> &ndash; This is a supermicrosurgical technique used to anastomose distal subdermal lymphatic vessels and adjacent venules less than 0.8 mm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/28,29,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,36</a>]. Distal subdermal lymphatics are less affected by lymphedema and are more readily available for a bypass procedure than deeper lymphatic channels. The pressure in the subdermal venules is lower than found in the deeper, larger veins. Hence, there is less venous backflow in the subdermal vessels and, at least in theory, should result in a permanent improvement of lymphedema. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascularized</strong> <strong>lymph node transfer</strong> &ndash; Lymph node transfer is a procedure that includes the transfer of healthy lymph nodes en bloc from one nodal basin to the site of obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. The recipient site can be the site of the prior lymph node excision or a nonanatomic site. Some authors have suggested that a &quot;lymphatic pump&quot; is created when lymph nodes are transferred nonanatomically; however, the mechanisms regulating lymphatic repair in this setting remain unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/15,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,37</a>]. The nodes are most commonly transferred using microsurgical techniques with arterial and venous anastomosis at the recipient site; there is usually no lymphatic anastomosis with this approach. A limiting factor of this approach is that lymphedema can develop in the donor extremity. This possibility has led to the use of mesenteric lymph nodes (eg, omentum or intestinal mesentery lymph nodes) as an alternative since harvesting lymph nodes from these areas does not result in lymphedema. These issues have to be balanced, however, with potential complications from intra-abdominal procedures (eg, hernia, small bowel obstruction, pancreatic injury). Prospective studies are needed to identify specific clinical settings where patients would be most likely to benefit from this procedure. However, systematic reviews of previously reported outcomes support a beneficial role (ie, decreased limb volume and improved quality of life) for this procedure in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4258521\"><span class=\"h4\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the outcome data for physiologic techniques are from retrospective reviews of mostly lymphatic bypass procedures. Lymphatic bypass procedures result in highly variable responses, ranging from a complete response to none. The variability of results among the different studies is likely due to a number of factors including differences in assessing volume or circumference, length of follow-up, variable use of postoperative compression garments <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical therapy, and the use of nonstandardized or nonvalidated questionnaires for subjective analysis. There has been no standardization of assessing volume of lymphedematous limb, and numerous techniques are reported to approximate volume changes following an operative procedure. Few studies report the use of complimentary techniques (eg, volume measurements and bioimpedance or lymphoscintigraphy) to corroborate measurements. Other caveats include mixed series of patients, either based upon etiology (eg, primary congenital conditions, or secondary lymphedema following nodal resections, trauma, or filariasis); location of lymphedema (eg, upper or lower extremity); <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> variable criteria for patient selection, selection of procedures, timing of intervention, and identification of suitable lymphatic vessels for bypass surgery. </p><p>In spite of these limitations, most authors report modest improvements in limb volumes (30 to 50 percent decreased), although a few individual patients experienced marked reductions, particularly for the upper extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/18,27-30,36,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27-30,36,41,42</a>]. In a study in which lymphovenous bypass was performed in 89 upper extremities and 11 lower extremities, the mean volume differential reductions were significantly better for stage 1 or 2 lymphedema compared with stage 3 or 4 lymphedema (61 versus 17 percent at six months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Long-term studies (follow-up &gt;3 years) have shown improvements with bypass procedures are maintained even when the use of a compression garment is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/27,29,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,36</a>].

Subjective improvement was reported in 87 percent, objective improvement in 83 percent, and the mean volume reduction was 67 percent.

Several other case reports and small series suggest that lymphatic bypass procedures may also be effective in reducing primary and secondary genital lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/27,29,30,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,30,44,45</a>].

Most complications are minor, such as delayed wound healing and lymphatic fistula, and typically improve spontaneously. Postoperative cellulitis is uncommon, most likely due to long-term postoperative antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema/abstract/29,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,46</a>].
