In addition, it is not always possible to precisely localize lesions within the colon, information that is important if patients require subsequent endoscopic or surgical therapy.</p><p>One method for overcoming these limitations is to provide a view of the colonoscope during the procedure. This was initially done with fluoroscopic guidance, but this approach is no longer used in routine clinical practice because of its inconvenience, added expense, and necessity for radiation exposure. An alternative to fluoroscopy is magnetic endoscopic imaging (MEI), which provides real-time three-dimensional views of the colonoscope shaft configuration and its location within the abdomen. This may aid trainees and less experienced endoscopists as they perform routine colonoscopies and may aid experienced endoscopists during difficult cases.</p><p>Issues related to MEI will be reviewed here. Other options for localizing lesions within the colon are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tattooing and other methods for localizing colonic lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066177967\"><span class=\"h1\">PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED DURING COLONOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability to visualize the shaft of the scope during colonoscopy may be helpful in multiple settings. It may aid the endoscopist during a difficult colonoscopy, it may help with lesion localization, and it may improve the teaching of colonoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066177974\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficult colonoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors that can increase the difficulty of colonoscopy include variations in colonic anatomy, loop formation during instrument insertion, and the presence of abdominal or pelvic adhesions. Increased colonic mobility can predispose to loop formation, whereas adhesions can interfere with normal scope insertion and loop reduction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066177981\"><span class=\"h3\">Influence of anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sigmoid and transverse colon are both mobile on a mesentery or &quot;mesocolon,&quot; which can be affected by manipulations of the colonoscope. Most colonoscope looping occurs within these segments. Another factor that predisposes to loop formation is that the transverse colon of female patients (and, less commonly, male patients) may extend down into the pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Although the descending colon and ascending colon are usually relatively fixed in the left and right paravertebral gutters, respectively, these portions of the colon are mobile in a significant minority of patients. As an example, there is no fixation at the splenic flexure in approximately 20 percent of patients, which allows atypical colonoscope looping in the left colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, the normally mobile sigmoid colon may have decreased mobility due to sigmoid adhesions that can result from diverticulitis, endometriosis, or pelvic surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066177988\"><span class=\"h3\">Looping and adhesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have looked at the causes of difficult colonoscopy. In a series of 500 patients in whom fluoroscopy was used, 16 percent of cases performed by experienced colonoscopists were categorized as difficult examinations (defined as no advancement of the colonoscope tip for at least five minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This was due to recurrent looping in 80 percent and to sigmoid adhesions in the remainder. The colonoscopists were frequently incorrect in identifying the site of looping, and in 30 percent of examinations, they were mistaken as to the location of the tip of the colonoscope.</p><p>Looping also makes the examination more difficult for patients as pain episodes may correspond to looping seen on magnetic endoscopic imaging (MEI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The pain is greatest with looping in the sigmoid colon, particularly in women and in those with preexisting symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066177995\"><span class=\"h3\">Other risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other risk factors have been described for difficult colonoscopy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema, there is a correlation between technically difficult colonoscopy and a long transverse colon or sigmoid colon adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. These factors in part explain the higher rate of difficult colonoscopy in women compared with men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/1,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-7</a>]. In a review of 2194 colonoscopies performed by a single experienced colonoscopist, the respective rates of difficult colonoscopy in women and men were 31 and 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonoscopy is more likely to be difficult in older women with diverticular disease and adhesions and in men with constipation and a long colon. Computed tomography (CT) colonography data confirm that &quot;difficult to colonoscope&quot; patients tend to have longer colons (particularly in the sigmoid and transverse colon), have more acute bends, and are more likely to be female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178002\"><span class=\"h2\">Lesion localization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precise localization of lesions within the colon is particularly important when surgical resection is required for a malignancy or a lesion needs to be reinspected at a later date. However, even skilled colonoscopists can misjudge the position of the colonoscope tip. It is easy to become confused about whether the tip is in the proximal sigmoid colon or at the splenic flexure, and the mid-transverse colon or hepatic flexure may be misidentified as being the cecum.</p><p>While a number of visual clues are commonly used to determine the location of the tip of the colonoscope, they are often misleading. As examples, the triangular appearance of the folds that are considered to be typical of the transverse colon may also be seen in the descending colon, while the bluish hue associated with the hepatic flexure may also been seen at the splenic flexure (especially within a long sigmoid loop).</p><p>Other clues such as the length of instrument inserted, transillumination through the anterior abdominal wall, abdominal palpation, and the responsiveness and feel of the instrument can also be misleading.</p><p>Imprecise localization of a lesion can result in incorrect preoperative information being given to the surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One role for MEI may be in localizing cancers seen at colonoscopy. A study found that MEI achieved 94 percent accuracy in determining the location of 82 cancers that could be reached endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This compared favorably with abdominopelvic CT, which localized 83 percent of cancers. Current guidelines recommend tattooing lesions for easy identification during follow-up examinations or surgery, though this may not occur if cancer was not suspected at the time of the colonoscopy and polypectomy. If, during the initial colonoscopy, MEI was used to document the location of the lesion, the confidence regarding the location may be greater than if it was only localized based on endoscopic findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tattooing-and-other-methods-for-localizing-colonic-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tattooing and other methods for localizing colonic lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178017\"><span class=\"h1\">COLONOSCOPY TRAINING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonoscopy training relies heavily upon apprenticeship. However, such training can be frustrating for both the trainee and the instructor. The trainee often finds it difficult to appreciate why certain maneuvers are indicated or effective; the instructor may be unable to assess why the trainee is &quot;stuck&quot; without taking over the procedure, leaving the trainee to act as an observer.</p><p>Fluoroscopy and magnetic endoscopic imaging (MEI) help to address these frustrations because they allow the instructor to guide the trainee without having to take over the procedure. Fluoroscopy has a number of limitations, while MEI is not widely available, though colonoscopy simulators are being developed that incorporate MEI. (See <a href=\"#H1066178081\" class=\"local\">'Colonoscopy performance and training'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178024\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE FOR FLUOROSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The problems associated with performing colonoscopy provide a rationale for the use of some imaging modality during colonoscopy. Fluoroscopy increases confidence in lesion localization, aids with loop reduction during difficult examinations, and can be a useful tool when teaching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/6,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,11</a>].</p><p>However, fluoroscopy is not routinely used for multiple reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluoroscopy can add time and expense to colonoscopy, exposes patients and staff to radiation, and is not always available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The area visible on-screen covers only a small part of the abdomen and may therefore give a misleading assessment of complex loops, especially when the patient lies in the conventional left lateral position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two-dimensional radiological image does not provide an impression of the three-dimensional configuration of the colonoscope shaft loops. As a result, it is limited in its ability to guide rotational maneuvers used for straightening loops.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of radiation hazards, fluoroscopy cannot be used to confirm that the assistant's hand is appropriately placed when applying pressure to the patient's abdomen to control loops.</p><p/><p>Magnetic endoscopic imaging is an alternative to fluoroscopy that addresses these limitations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178031\"><span class=\"h1\">MAGNETIC ENDOSCOPIC IMAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178039\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With magnetic endoscopic imaging (MEI), electromagnetic fields are sensed by small coils within the colonoscope and larger ones alongside the patient, producing a moving image of the colonoscope configuration on a display monitor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52473\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef52473 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83348\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83348 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83349\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83349 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>In the first prototype, the transmitter coil assemblies were outside the patient, and miniature receiver coils were in a catheter inserted down the instrument channel of the endoscope. A number of key refinements resulted in improved image representation and overall functionality. A commercial version of the magnetic endoscopic imager is now available (ScopeGuide, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo). </p><p>The first-generation ScopeGuide was a large standalone unit with a receiver dish, processing unit, and display screen that is positioned alongside the patient. This is connected to a dedicated colonoscope containing built-in transmitter coils. A coil catheter can be inserted through the <span class=\"nowrap\">instrument/suction</span> channel of a standard colonoscope, although this is less ideal because the catheter prevents suctioning and is too fragile for routine use. The transmitter coils were incorporated into a dedicated MEI colonoscope, resulting in a bulkier-than-standard colonoscope. The second-generation ScopeGuide (UPD-3) has a much smaller receiver dish (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83349\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83349 \">picture 2</a>) with the image displayed as a picture-in-picture (PIP) on the main screen that is displaying the endoscope view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83348\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83348 \">picture 1</a>). The processing unit sits with the main endoscope image processing unit. The most recent commercial endoscope (Olympus 290) series has incorporated the transmitter coils in both standard and slim insertion tube colonoscopes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178046\"><span class=\"h2\">Image display</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Software calculates the three-dimensional (3D) position and orientation of each receiver coil, and the data are displayed in real-time as a computer-rendered 3D image of the colonoscope shaft configuration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52473\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef52473 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p>The shaft configuration can be displayed either in anteroposterior (AP) view alone or in split-screen view, combining AP and lateral views side by side. The split-screen view helps to clarify the colonoscope loop configuration in 3D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62224\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62224 \">figure 1</a>). The monitor can also be configured to maintain the AP view despite changes in patient positioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178053\"><span class=\"h2\">Hand marker</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Targeted abdominal pressure applied by an assistant can be useful in managing colonoscope loops. Using an external coil held in the assistant's hand, it is possible to determine the position of the hand relative to the colonoscope, as well as the effect of the applied pressure on looping (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62224\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62224 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178060\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF MEI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic endoscopic imaging (MEI) helps with loop reduction, application of abdominal pressure, localization of the tip of the colonoscope, and providing instruction in colonoscopy. It may also have a place in competency assessment during the credentialing process for colonoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178067\"><span class=\"h2\">Loop identification and reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Correct loop identification is required for a successful reduction of looping during colonoscopy. However, endoscopists frequently miscategorize loops, especially if they are complex or unusual.</p><p>In a study of 100 consecutive colonoscopies done with MEI by experienced colonoscopists who were blinded to the imager view, various looping configurations were seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Despite skilled and careful insertion technique, loops occurred in 91 percent of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55708\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55708 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The endoscopists incorrectly identified the loops in 69 percent of cases, with less common looping configurations, such as counterclockwise spiral loops, being incorrectly assessed in 100 percent. In addition, when abdominal pressure was applied, it was generally inaccurate, due either to hand misplacement away from the apex of the loop or to inaccessibility of the loop deep within the abdomen.</p><p>There are numerous loop configurations that may occur during colonoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75180 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78533\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78533 \">figure 3</a>). The following examples illustrate how MEI may aid with loop reduction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An &quot;N&quot; loop as seen from the front or AP view has been said to be the most common sigmoid looping configuration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75180 \">figure 2</a>). However, many supposed N loops have a spiral component. MEI can help identify this configuration, which requires the endoscopist to &quot;push through&quot; the descending colon to the splenic flexure before straightening the colonoscope with pull-back and clockwise torque.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;reversed alpha&quot; loop consists of a counterclockwise spiral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75180 \">figure 2</a>). An endoscopist without MEI often does not realize it is counterclockwise and is therefore unable to remove the loop with conventional clockwise torque. Once recognized, pulling back with strong counterclockwise torque straightens the loop. Counterclockwise torque is then applied during further insertion to prevent the sigmoid loop from reforming.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178074\"><span class=\"h2\">Tip localization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MEI aids with localization of the colonoscope tip, which may be important for confirming cecal intubation and lesion localization. Contrast studies following MEI-guided application of endoclips in predefined anatomical locations showed good correlation between MEI-defined and actual anatomical clip locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. However, it is possible to be misled by the shape of the instrument alone. As a result, the typical features of the cecum and ileocecal valve should always be confirmed before concluding that a colonoscopy is complete. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178081\"><span class=\"h2\">Colonoscopy performance and training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of randomized trials have assessed the impact of MEI on colonoscopy performance with mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/16,19-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19-26</a>]. Some studies demonstrated improvements in parameters such as cecal intubation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], loop reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/19,21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,27</a>], external pressure application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/19,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,25</a>], pain scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and insertion times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>]. However, improvements in loop reduction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cecal intubation rates did not always result in decreased procedure times or sedation requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/19,21,23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,23,27</a>]. One direct comparison with double balloon endoscopy found the use of MEI with a transparent cap was less effective for achieving caecal intubation within 30 minutes in patients with previously incomplete or difficult colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 13 studies, the use of MEI resulted in a lower risk of failed cecal intubation compared with conventional colonoscopy (6.8 versus 10.1 percent; risk difference 4 percent, 95% CI 0 to 7 percent) and slightly shorter time to cecal intubation (mean difference 0.6 minutes, 95% CI 0.3-0.9 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, when the analysis was restricted to high-quality studies, the differences were no longer seen. </p><p>The impact of MEI on colonoscopy performance appears to be greatest for trainees and inexperienced colonoscopists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/19,22,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22,29,30</a>]. However, there is also evidence of some benefit from MEI for experienced colonoscopists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/16,19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19,28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a pilot trial, a single beginner colonoscopist (15 previous colonoscopies) performed procedures under supervision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to have their procedures with or without MEI. Improved loop management was noted when MEI was employed. A plateau was reached after 50 cases, when 90 percent completion rates were achieved. Once that plateau was reached, no difference was seen comparing cases performed with and without MEI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of 296 colonoscopies looked at the effect of MEI on colonoscopy performance by a trainee (200 previous cases) and by two experienced endoscopists (&gt;5000 previous cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The trainee, when using MEI, had significant improvements in cecal intubation rates, insertion times, duration of colonoscope looping, number of straightening attempts, and accuracy of hand pressure.

The total radiation exposure is less than that generated by a television monitor.</p><p>There was a theoretical safety concern that exposure to magnetic fields could be harmful.

However, it is the electric fields, and not the magnetic fields, around power lines or phones that are of actual concern. </p><p>Studies of the use of MEI in patients with implantable cardiac devices have not shown any interference or change in settings, and are considered safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/magnetic-endoscopic-imaging/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066178102\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging during colonoscopy may be helpful in multiple settings.
