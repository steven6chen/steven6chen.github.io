Large tumors may be associated with significant edema, mass effect, and increased intracranial pressure.

In most of these cases, the family history is notable for multiple first- and second-degree family members with early-onset cancers. Such patients are typically offered a referral for genetic counseling. Little is known about the genetic factors underlying apparently sporadic high-grade gliomas and families with clustering of brain tumors in the absence of a recognized genetic syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-brain-tumors#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a>.)</p><p>Aside from genetic factors, the only established risk factor for glioblastoma and other high-grade gliomas is exposure to ionizing radiation, as occurs from therapeutic radiation therapy for childhood brain tumors or leukemia. The latency between irradiation and the development of a glioma varies from five years to several decades. Data on other environmental exposures including electromagnetic radiation, radiofrequency radiation from cell phones, and head trauma are inconclusive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-brain-tumors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Ionizing radiation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2597782\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast-enhanced MRI is superior to computed tomography (CT) for the characterization of brain tumors.</p><p>On MRI, high-grade gliomas are typically hypointense on T1-weighted images and enhance heterogeneously following contrast administration. Glioblastomas typically have a pattern of intense rim enhancement with central clearing, indicative of necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F113733\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113733 \">image 1</a>). Enhancing tumor can be distinguished from the surrounding hypointense signal of edema on T1-weighted sequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65860\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65860 \">image 2</a>). Regardless of the histologic grade, high-grade gliomas generally show increased T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal intensity; however, some anaplastic gliomas do not manifest contrast enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Many anaplastic gliomas and some glioblastomas are characterized by areas of infiltrative, nonenhancing tumor that may be multifocal. Infiltrative tumor typically appears as expansile T2 hyperintense signal abnormality involving both cortex and underlying white matter. Such areas may or may not be contiguous with enhancing portions of the tumor. Anaplastic oligodendrogliomas may have areas of internal calcification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idh-mutant-1p-19q-codeleted-oligodendrogliomas-clinical-features-pathology-and-prognostic-factors#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas: Clinical features, pathology, and prognostic factors&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p>On magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), high-grade gliomas are typically characterized by increased choline and decreased N-acetylaspartate. Evidence of increased blood volume is often present on magnetic resonance perfusion imaging. Like other malignancies, high-grade gliomas have increased metabolic activity and usually show increased uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose on positron emission tomography (PET). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1473706376\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a suspected high-grade glioma should undergo history and physical examination to evaluate for symptoms and neurologic deficits associated with the tumor. The degree of deficits and the clinical stability of the patient guide the urgency of neurosurgical evaluation and treatment and need for corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults#H1415435983\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;, section on 'Role of glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast is often the only study required preoperatively. Patients with a contraindication to brain MRI should undergo head computed tomography (CT) with contrast. Screening for systemic malignancy is not necessary when the clinical and radiographic suspicion for high-grade glioma is high (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F113770\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113770 \">algorithm 1</a>). The initial evaluation and differential diagnosis of brain tumors in adults is reviewed in detail separately.

Prophylactic antiseizure drugs in patients who have not had a seizure are not indicated outside of the perioperative period.

This can be accomplished either at the time of surgical resection or in a separate biopsy procedure. Biopsy alone is used in situations where the lesion is not amenable to resection, a meaningful amount of tumor tissue cannot be removed, or the patient's overall clinical condition will not permit surgery. In the remaining cases, maximal safe resection is the preferred initial approach to both diagnosis and management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Deep-seated or multifocal tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combined use of computerized imaging and stereotactic devices has allowed neurosurgeons to perform deep brain biopsies with accurate tumor localization. Frameless stereotaxy establishes a computerized link between the preoperative three-dimensional tumor volume and the surface landmarks of the patient. This link permits the neurosurgeon to be aware of the three-dimensional position of surgical instruments within the intracranial space during the biopsy based upon the preoperative imaging.</p><p>Stereotactic image-guided brain biopsy is an accurate and safe diagnostic procedure in patients with focal lesions. Diagnostic yield is approximately 90 percent. Complications occur in up to 15 percent of cases, most commonly transient neurologic deficits (10 percent), biopsy-site hemorrhage (8 percent), and permanent neurologic deficits (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The procedure-related mortality rate is 1 to 2 percent. Although rare, tumor seeding along the stereotactic biopsy tract has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>For tumors that contain both enhancing and nonenhancing components, biopsy should target the enhancing areas in an effort to obtain diagnostic tissue that is representative of the highest-grade portion of the tumor.</p><p>Both positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have been used to identify metabolically active areas of tumor, thereby increasing the accuracy of stereotactic brain biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. These techniques are primarily research tools and are not in widespread clinical use for this purpose, as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically provides sufficient information to guide optimal biopsy site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgically accessible tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial treatment for high-grade gliomas in accessible locations is resection. Maximal resection with preservation of neurologic function is an important goal in the initial management of patients with high-grade gliomas, and the extent of surgery must be balanced with preservation of neurologic function.</p><p>The available evidence suggests that aggressive resection is associated with improved functional status and possibly with prolonged survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Various preoperative and intraoperative advances are being incorporated into patient management to facilitate these goals. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Extent of resection'</a> below.)</p><p>A review of over 38,000 surgical admissions for supratentorial brain tumors from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1988 and 2000 showed three important trends: decreasing inpatient mortality over time for brain tumor operations, centralization of care with higher-volume centers performing an ever larger percentage of all such surgeries, and reduced mortality at high-volume hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For craniotomy, mortality at hospitals with five or fewer admissions per year was 4.5 percent, compared with 1.5 percent at hospitals with 42 or more admissions per year. It is not known whether these trends affect long-term outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative functional MRI and diffusion tractography may be used to optimize tumor volume definition and minimize operative injury to eloquent (eg, speech and motor) areas by allowing preoperative definition of affected and normal brain areas and functional mapping of brain tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. In addition to localization of functional &quot;cortical areas&quot; such as motor cortex via functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging now enables the visualization of &quot;subcortical&quot; tracts that carry eloquent task information from speech, motor, and visual pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraoperative techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several intraoperative techniques are used to improve the extent of surgical resection while minimizing collateral damage to normal brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For tumors located in eloquent areas, awake craniotomy combining frameless computer-guided stereotaxis with intraoperative cortical stimulation and repetitive neurologic and language assessments may facilitate aggressive resection while minimizing postoperative neurologic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Traditionally this approach has used repetitive testing, with resection discontinued at the first evidence of neurologic dysfunction. Alternatively, local stimulation has been used to induce language dysfunction, with tumor resection proceeding only in areas not involving language centers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specially designed operating rooms that are equipped with computed tomography (CT) or MRI scanners can guide the resection in &quot;real time.&quot; In contrast to frame-based or frameless stereotaxy, this advancement allows actual assessment of tumor volume in its current anatomic location, rather than relying on preoperative data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Intraoperative imaging is used to identify residual tumor after the initial resection and thus can be used to guide further surgery. Such techniques have been shown to increase the proportion of patients that have a gross total resection on postoperative MRI but may not necessarily improve survival in patients with high-grade gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The effectiveness of intraoperative MRI was assessed in a trial in which 58 patients were randomly assigned to surgery with or without intraoperative MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. At surgery, 49 patients had high-grade gliomas and were evaluable. In 8 of 24 cases using intraoperative MRI, imaging revealed residual tumor and led to additional tumor resection. Overall, significantly more patients managed with intraoperative MRI had a complete resection compared with those managed without MRI (96 versus 68 percent). There was no increase in neurologic deficits with this more aggressive surgical approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some centers have expertise in the use of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which is an oral optical imaging agent that helps to visualize malignant tissue during surgery with use of specialized surgical microscopes and light source filters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Use of ALA as an adjunct to surgery improves intraoperative tumor visualization and thus enables greater extent of resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. ALA can be combined with other operative techniques, including intraoperative MRI, to help achieve maximal resection with preservation of neurologic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>Despite these advances in surgical techniques, local recurrences are frequent even in patients undergoing an apparently complete removal of the tumor. High-grade gliomas are characterized by poorly defined tumor margins with infiltration of neoplastic cells along white matter fibers and the perivascular spaces, which can extend well beyond the tumor margin as defined by the surgeon or by radiographic studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Extent of resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of surgery in patients with high-grade glioma is to confirm a pathologic diagnosis and achieve maximal safe resection consistent with preservation of neurologic function. Gliomas are infiltrative tumors, and resection requires removal of both tumor and involved brain tissue. The feasibility of resection depends heavily on the location of the tumor in relation to eloquent cortex.</p><p>Whether complete resection of a high-grade glioma confers improved survival compared with lesser amounts of resection is controversial, and there are no randomized trials examining this question. Most, but not all, observational studies find that extent of resection is a strong prognostic factor in patients with high-grade glioma, even after adjusting for variables known to be related to both surgical decision-making and outcome, such as age, functional status, and tumor size and location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/14,28,29,33-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,28,29,33-41</a>].</p><p>As an example, in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry study that included over 20,000 adults with glioblastoma diagnosed between 1998 and 2009, extent of resection was categorized as gross total resection, subtotal resection (including partial resection and excisional biopsy), or no surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Thirty percent of the cohort underwent gross total resection, and the likelihood of undergoing gross total resection decreased with advancing age. Compared with subtotal resection, gross total resection was associated with an approximately two- to three-month improvement in overall survival across all age groups. For patients age 45 to 59 years, for example, median overall survival times after gross total resection, subtotal resection, and no surgery were 15, 12, and 7 months, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for gross total versus subtotal resection 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.89).</p><p>Other studies have attempted to determine whether a survival benefit may exist for significant subtotal resection of the gadolinium-enhancing portions of the tumor, for cases in which gross total resection is not possible. In retrospective analyses of hundreds of surgical cases, a survival benefit has been suggested for resections above a threshold of 70 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>Other benefits of maximal resection rather than biopsy include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection rather than biopsy provides a larger, more representative sample for detailed analysis, thereby increasing the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis, which can help to direct further therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Debulking surgery may facilitate rapid tapering and discontinuation of corticosteroids, thereby reducing the likelihood of steroid-related complications.</p><p/><p>The presence of a mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (<em>IDH1</em>) or type 2 (<em>IDH2</em>) may be another factor relevant to the association between extent of resection and overall survival. In one large series, maximal resection of both enhancing and nonenhancing total tumor volume conferred a significant survival advantage for <em>IDH1</em>-mutant high-grade astrocytomas; for <em>IDH1</em>-wildtype tumors, complete resection of enhancing tumor volume but not total tumor volume was associated with improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].
