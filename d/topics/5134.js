ET has also been called essential thrombocytosis and primary thrombocytosis. It is characterized by excessive, clonal platelet production with a tendency for thrombosis and hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ET will be reviewed here. The prognosis and treatment of this disorder are presented separately as is the general approach to the patient with an elevated platelet count.

ET is a clonal stem cell disorder and the increased platelet counts are a result of excessive platelet production and not prolonged platelet survival in the peripheral blood. &#160;</p><p>Approximately 90 percent of cases have a somatically acquired driver mutation in <em>JAK2</em>, <em>CALR</em>, or <em>MPL</em>. These mutations result in the upregulation of JAK-STAT target genes, demonstrating the central importance of this pathway in the pathogenesis of ET. Ongoing investigations are aimed at determining the significance of these and other mutations in the genesis of ET and the other myeloproliferative neoplasms as well as their relative roles in determining disease phenotype, leukemic transformation, and the level of involvement of stem cells in these disorders. This is described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H1272969501\" class=\"local\">'Genetic features'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Mutations in PV, ET, and PMF'</a>.)</p><p>While most cases of ET appear to be sporadic, families with an increased incidence of ET have been described, with affected members having the same or different ET-defining mutations or even different MPN type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Familial cases are thought to be due to a genetic predisposition to acquire somatic mutations rather than to direct inheritance of germline mutations. &#160;</p><p>Neither thrombopoietin (TPO) nor its receptor (c-Mpl) has been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of ET. Mutations involving the c-Mpl gene are identified in ET in about 5 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and endogenous megakaryocyte colony growth does not appear to be dependent on an autocrine stimulation involving TPO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This is in contrast to autosomal dominant familial essential thrombocythemia where activating mutations in the genes for TPO or c-Mpl, or mutations in the genes for other proteins are responsible for TPO-mediated thrombocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-physiology-of-thrombopoietin#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and physiology of thrombopoietin&quot;, section on 'Familial thrombocythemia'</a>.)</p><p>Serum TPO levels in ET have been reported to be inappropriately normal or elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This unexpected finding may be a result of increased bone marrow stromal production of TPO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or decreased ligand clearance associated with reduced platelet c-Mpl expression in patients with ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Increased sensitivity of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells to TPO in vitro was found in 18 of 20 patients with ET, 1 of 8 patients with secondary thrombocytosis, and 0 of 22 healthy volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similarly, endogenous megakaryocyte colony formation was found in 11 of 11 patients with ET and in none of 6 patients with reactive thrombocytosis or 7 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In contrast, endogenous megakaryocyte colony formation does not appear to distinguish ET (positive in 40 of 42 patients) from polycythemia vera (positive in 47 of 50 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ET accounts for approximately one-third of cases of <em>BCR-ABL</em> negative myeloproliferative neoplasms in the developed world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Population-based epidemiologic studies have suggested an incidence rate for ET of 1 to 2.5 new <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/100,000</span> population per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. Because life expectancy appears to be near normal in ET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], the prevalence of the disease is much higher, and estimates have ranged from 9 to 24 total <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/100,000</span> population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/15,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21</a>].</p><p>The incidence varies with race, sex, and age. In the United States, there is a higher incidence among Blacks as compared with non-Hispanic Whites and a lower incidence among Hispanic Whites and Asian Pacific Islanders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There is a female preponderance with an approximate female to male incidence ratio of 2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/14,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22-25</a>]. The incidence increases with increasing age; the median age at diagnosis is 60 years, although as many as 20 percent may be younger than 40 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The prognosis of ET is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-treatment-of-essential-thrombocythemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and treatment of essential thrombocythemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Childhood ET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ET is rare in children, and little is known concerning its prognosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Population-based studies in Denmark and British Columbia have estimated an annual incidence of ET of 0.09 per million in children up to 14 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/27,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30</a>]. </p><p>When ET does occur in children, it appears to be relatively benign. This was shown in a study of 64 consecutive patients &lt;20 years of age being evaluated for a Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Of these, 50 were found to have sporadic or hereditary thrombocytosis, with the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no prior episodes or thrombosis or bleeding. Symptoms were present in 16, and consisted of headaches in 13 and paresthesias in three. Splenomegaly was present in eight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 34 children with sporadic thrombocythemia, 48 percent carried the <em>JAK2 V617F</em> mutation, while none had a <em>MPL</em> mutation. Among the 16 with hereditary thrombocythemia, none had the <em>JAK2</em> mutation and 15 had a <em>MPL</em> mutation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After a median follow-up of approximately 11 years, no patient had developed acute leukemia or post-ET myelofibrosis, while three patients experienced a non-fatal thrombotic episode.</p><p/><p>In two small studies, the percent of female children with a monoclonal pattern was 27 and 73 percent, while positivity for the <em>JAK2</em> mutation was seen in 20 and 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. </p><p>When ET is diagnosed in a child, it is reasonable to determine whether the disorder is acquired or familial by examining the parents and other family members. Two instructive examples are given below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one case, ET with a <em>JAK2 V617F </em>mutation was diagnosed in a 4.5-year-old child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Genetic analysis of the child's antenatal blood spot (Guthrie card) revealed presence of the <em>JAK2</em> mutation, which was not present in either parent, suggesting that the mutation was somatically acquired in utero.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second case, prolonged thrombocytosis over a three-year period was diagnosed as ET in a six-year-old male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Testing for <em>BCR-ABL</em>, <em>JAK2 V617F</em>, and <em>MPL</em> mutations was negative. However, sequence analysis revealed a novel <em>JAK2</em> mutation at nucleotide 1691 in exon 13, resulting in an amino acid substitution of arginine to glutamine at position 564 (ie, <em>JAK2 R564Q</em>). The same mutation was found in the subject's sister and mother, both of whom had thrombocytosis, confirming this as familial ET. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1308125093\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to one-half of patients with ET are discovered incidentally when thrombocytosis is noted on a complete blood count obtained for some other reason. Others present with disease-related symptoms (eg, headache, dizziness, visual changes) or complications (eg, thrombosis, bleeding, first-trimester fetal loss). Unlike in polycythemia vera, pruritus is very uncommon in ET, occurring in less than 5 percent of patients.</p><p>There exists a wide range in the reported incidence rates of disease-related complications in ET because of inter-study differences in patient selection and the definition of what constitutes a &quot;vasomotor symptom,&quot; &quot;hemorrhage,&quot; or &quot;thrombotic event.&quot; </p><p>In a single institution retrospective study of 150 patients with newly diagnosed ET, the median age at diagnosis was 50 years (range 17 to 98) and there was a female predominance (66 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
