It is the most common of the indolent NHLs defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The vast majority of patients treated for FL will have an initial response to therapy with 40 to 80 percent demonstrating a complete response, depending upon the initial regimen used. Unfortunately, conventional therapy for FL is not curative and virtually all of these patients will ultimately develop progressive disease. In addition, less than 10 percent of patients treated with initial chemoimmunotherapy will not respond to treatment (ie, refractory disease).</p><p>The treatment of relapsed or refractory FL is discussed here. The treatment of previously untreated FL is presented separately as are the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and pathobiology of follicular lymphoma.

At these visits, patients are evaluated with a history, physical examination, and blood work. Imaging studies are reserved for the evaluation of suspected relapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of limited stage (I/II) follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Progressive disease (PD) or relapse after complete remission (CR) most commonly presents as asymptomatic enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver, or spleen. PD or relapse after CR reflects the appearance of any new lesion, a 50 percent increase in the longest diameter of a previously identified lesion, or <span class=\"nowrap\">new/recurrent</span> involvement of the bone marrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97480 \">table 1</a>).

Signs or symptoms that suggest histologic transformation include the rapid progression of lymphadenopathy, infiltration of uncommon extranodal sites (excluding the bone marrow), development of systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, night sweats), elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypercalcemia.</p><p>Lymph node biopsy should be performed if histologic transformation is suspected.

In general, the same indications for treatment used for first-line therapy are used at the time of relapse or progressive disease. These are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma#H19675522\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage (III/IV) follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Indications for treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT OF INITIAL RELAPSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with symptomatic FL and a subset of those with an increase in disease tempo require treatment. There is no standard therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory FL and practice varies widely; as such, patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials whenever possible. Often, a &quot;risk stratified&quot; approach is used such that patients who appear to have more aggressive disease are treated with more intensive therapies at the time of relapse.</p><p>The main treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory FL include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77636\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77636 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical trials of new agents or new combinations of existing agents</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunotherapy either with single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or rituximab plus chemotherapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rechallenge of original therapy </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) rescue</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allogeneic HCT</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radioimmunotherapy with radiolabeled antibodies</p><p/><p>A choice among these options must take into account both tumor and patient characteristics that may have impact on efficacy and how the treatment may affect future therapies. Importantly, this decision must take into account the response to prior therapies. A patient relapsing five years after initial treatment with single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> would likely respond to retreatment with rituximab. In contrast, a patient relapsing within two years of receiving R-CHOP has a very poor prognosis and needs an aggressive approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunotherapy either with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> alone or rituximab plus chemotherapy is a treatment option for most patients with relapsed or refractory FL. Single agent rituximab has response rates as high as 40 percent with minimal toxicity. When other chemotherapy agents are added, response rates increase, as do toxicities. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapy-based treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High dose chemotherapy with autologous HCT rescue can prolong the progression-free and overall survival rates of patients in complete response or with minimal disease at the time of HCT. (See <a href=\"#H31594622\" class=\"local\">'Transplantation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation in follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allogeneic HCT may be curative in a highly selected cohort of patients. Eligibility is primarily determined based upon the patient's age, performance status, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of comorbid conditions. Otherwise fit patients who relapse after a short initial response (ie, &lt;1 year) to chemoimmunotherapy and demonstrate chemotherapy sensitive disease may be ideal candidates for this approach in second or greater remission. However, HCT, particularly autologous HCT, may affect bone marrow reserve and the ability to perform RIT in the future or vice versa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) has demonstrated response rates of approximately 60 to 80 percent. However, RIT is not recommended for patients with poor bone marrow reserve or high tumor burden in the bone marrow and requires coordination with physicians trained in the safe use of radionucleotides. (See <a href=\"#H31594531\" class=\"local\">'Radioimmunotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy is primarily used for the palliation of patients who have symptoms related to a single disease site. (See <a href=\"#H31594741\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For most patients with relapsed or refractory FL, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, rather than chemotherapy alone or RIT. Patients with a poor performance status may prefer single agent rituximab for its relatively low toxicity profile, while patients with a good performance status may prefer combination therapy for its superior response rates despite greater toxicity and no proven improvement in survival rates. RIT is an excellent treatment alternative for eligible patients, but is not as commonly employed due to the complexity of administration.</p><p>The choice of treatment at relapse should also take into account the patient's response to initial therapy. Patients who have an initial response duration significantly less than the mean progression-free survival (PFS) for an individual treatment regimen may be considered for more aggressive treatment at relapse, such as the use of autologous HCT. PFS differs greatly by treatment regimen. Patients who receive extended dose single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> as first line therapy for FL have a median PFS of approximately two or more years, while patients who receive initial treatment with rituximab plus combination chemotherapy demonstrate median PFS of three to seven years, depending upon the regimen used. As an example, a relapse within two years of initial treatment with R-CHOP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> plus rituximab) chemotherapy, which has a median PFS of greater than four years, would be considered significantly shorter than the mean. Such patients may need to be considered for aggressive therapy (eg, HCT) at the time of relapse. In contrast, a patient relapsing more than two years after treatment with single agent rituximab would be an ideal candidate for retreatment with single agent rituximab.</p><p>These various treatment modalities are discussed in more detail in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOTHERAPY-BASED TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monoclonal antibodies (ie, immunotherapy) are a key component to the treatment of patients with FL; as discussed separately, their incorporation into initial therapy results in superior response rates, progression free survival, and overall survival when compared with chemotherapy alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma#H19675536\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage (III/IV) follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Immunotherapy-based treatment'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> is also used, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, in the treatment of relapsed or refractory FL, including patients who demonstrated an objective clinical response to an initial course of rituximab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The major toxicities of rituximab include infusion reactions (ie, fevers, rigors, and hypotension) and infections related to immunosuppression. Rituximab also imposes a risk of hepatitis B reactivation among patients positive for HBsAg or anti-HBc. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infusion-related-reactions-to-therapeutic-monoclonal-antibodies-used-for-cancer-therapy#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infusion-related reactions to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies used for cancer therapy&quot;, section on 'Rituximab'</a>.)</p><p>Most studies have utilized intravenous administration. A subcutaneous formulation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-and-hyaluronidase-subcutaneous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab-hyaluronidase</a>) that uses a fixed dose and a shorter administration time is an acceptable alternative for patients who have tolerated at least one full dose of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Randomized trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety of the two formulations in patients with FL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>Initial studies support the investigation of novel type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obinutuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obinutuzumab</a>, with or without chemotherapy for the treatment of relapsed or refractory FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, it is unclear whether these newer antibodies offer superior outcomes when compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. As an example, a phase II randomized trial failed to demonstrate a progression-free survival or survival benefit with obinutuzumab when compared with rituximab in 175 patients with relapsed indolent B cell lymphoma (85 percent FL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Several prospective randomized trials and one meta-analysis have examined the role of interferon as immunotherapy in advanced stage disease patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/11-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-21</a>]. Given the variability of results of the various trials, the expense and toxicity of treatment, as well as the lack of trials in which interferon was employed along with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and other newer treatment regimens, use of interferon following intensive chemotherapy does not appear to be warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in the treatment of FL demonstrated responses in approximately half of previously treated patients.

In addition, response rates reported in clinical trials cannot be accurately compared due to changes over time in the response assessment and response definitions.

The most common cytopenias are leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, which are easily managed in the majority of patients. RIT causes a transient depletion of B cells for approximately six to nine months, but has not been associated with significant increases in severe infections or hospitalizations. RIT can be associated with an infusion reaction similar to that seen with other monoclonal antibodies. This is described in more detail separately.

Early evidence suggests that patients relapsing following treatment with RIT may tolerate other treatment approaches including chemotherapy, external beam radiation therapy, and autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31594622\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSPLANTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31594723\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While relapsed FL is typically sensitive to additional therapy, the duration of remission generally becomes shorter with each subsequent therapy. In addition, a subset of patients will transform to a more aggressive histology. The use of either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in relapsed FL is controversial and the subject of numerous ongoing clinical trials. </p><p>The decision to perform an HCT in an eligible patient with relapsed FL depends upon the aggressiveness of disease. Unfortunately, our ability to predict the aggressiveness of disease is limited. FL is a heterogeneous entity and some patients may enjoy very long treatment-free intervals, while others develop progressive disease rapidly or chemotherapy refractory disease or histologic transformation early on in their course. Our best measures of disease aggressiveness are the length and quality of initial (and subsequent) remission(s), and the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55987\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55987 \">table 3</a>). However, even the FLIPI, while useful as a general prognostic guide, does not reliably distinguish those who will have an extremely rapid decline, since even in the high-risk group the 10-year survival rate is still 36 percent. Despite this uncertainty, patients with an initial remission duration significantly less than the median progression-free survival for an individual treatment regimen and those with a high FLIPI score are more likely to have a short remission duration. </p><p>Among patients with relapsed FL, we and others consider HCT for patients with clinically aggressive disease who have relapsed after initial treatment with a regimen that incorporates immunotherapy, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. In general, we consider HCT for patients with a remission duration significantly less than the median remission duration expected for a particular regimen. As an example, prospective trials of R-CHOP have reported median remission durations of approximately 6.8 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/25,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,61</a>]. As such, patients progressing within 18 to 24 months of initial treatment with R-CHOP might be considered for HCT. In comparison, the median remission duration for R-CVP reported in prospective trials is 2.8 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. As such, a remission duration of 18 to 24 months after R-CVP is not unexpected; however, patients progressing within one year of R-CVP might be considered for HCT.

Idelalisib is associated with an increase in opportunistic infections and the manufacturer recommends prophylaxis for <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PCP) and monitoring for cytomegalovirus.

Histologic transformation to a more aggressive variant is suggested by the rapid progression of lymphadenopathy, infiltration of uncommon extranodal sites, development of systemic symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities. Such patients should undergo lymph node biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of suspected relapse or resistance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Histologic transformation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asymptomatic recurrent FL do not necessarily require immediate treatment, but should be followed closely for the development of symptomatic disease. Patients with symptomatic FL or those with an increase in disease tempo require treatment. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no standard therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory FL and practice varies widely; as such, patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials whenever possible. A choice among potential therapies must take into account characteristics of both the tumor and the patient as well as an evaluation of the initial response to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment of initial relapse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients with relapsed or refractory FL, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, rather than chemotherapy alone or radioimmunotherapy (RIT) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapy-based treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A choice between single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and combination chemotherapy plus rituximab depends largely upon the patient's performance status. For patients with a poor performance status <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a clinically indolent course, we suggest single agent rituximab for its relatively low toxicity profile (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with a good performance status and a more aggressive clinical course, we suggest the use of rituximab plus combination chemotherapy for its superior response rates despite greater toxicity and no proven improvement in survival rates (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapy-based treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with relapsed or refractory FL undergoing chemoimmunotherapy, we suggest R-CVP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>), R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab), or BR (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> plus rituximab) rather than other regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This preference is based largely upon our clinical experience with these regimens. A choice between these regimens can be made based upon the patient's history of prior therapy. As examples, R-CHOP or R-CVP may be preferred for a patient who has previously received BR, while BR may be preferred for a patient who has previously received R-CVP or R-CHOP. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chemoimmunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low dose radiation therapy can be used for the palliation of local disease symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H31594741\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision of whether to proceed with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) should be based on the patient's preference, condition, and the expected disease course. For the latter, there is no definitive score or metric. For eligible patients who relapse after a short initial response (ie, &lt;1 to 2 years) to chemoimmunotherapy and demonstrate chemotherapy sensitive disease, we suggest autologous HCT rather than treatment with chemoimmunotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Patients who relapse after autologous HCT should be strongly considered for nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT. (See <a href=\"#H31594622\" class=\"local\">'Transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance therapy with the monoclonal antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> appears to prolong progression-free, and perhaps overall, survival in patients with relapsed FL who did not receive rituximab as part of their initial therapy. The role of maintenance rituximab in the treatment of patients who have previously received rituximab is unclear. It is reasonable to offer maintenance following the treatment of relapse if the relapse did <strong>not</strong> occur while the patient was receiving maintenance therapy. There is no role for rituximab maintenance in the treatment of patients with FL that is refractory to rituximab (eg, patients who have progressed while receiving rituximab maintenance after initial therapy). Results from one study suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obinutuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obinutuzumab</a> maintenance improves progression-free survival, but not overall survival, in patients with relapsed or refractory disease treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> plus obinutuzumab. We do not routinely use this regimen as it has not demonstrated a survival benefit and has associated toxicities.
