Many affected individuals are quite functional; for the minority, delusions of parasitic infection may interfere with usual activities, and for some very significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Delusional infestation is a delusional disorder of the somatic type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], a subgroup of delusional disorders in which nonexistent disease or alteration of the body forms the basis of the disorder. Delusions of infestation are the most common form of monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis; others include delusions of dysmorphism and delusions of body odor or halitosis. </p><p>This topic addresses the treatment of delusional infestation. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of delusional infestation are discussed separately. Other psychotic disorders are discussed separately.

The delusion of infestation occurs secondary to another psychiatric disorder or to a medical illness.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12625559\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Key to the management of patients with delusional infestation is the development of a strong, therapeutic relationship. Many patients express dissatisfaction with previous clinicians whom they believe are incompetent and uncaring. As a result, patients often fail to attend follow-up appointments and receive inadequate or no therapy. A nonjudgmental approach, acknowledgment that the patient's symptoms are real, and empathetic exploration into the effects their symptoms have had on their daily lives can instill a sense of trust [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>It has been debated whether or not the clinician should overtly agree or disagree with the patient's beliefs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Many authors suggest that a nonconfrontational approach be employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/2,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-9</a>], using phrases such as &quot;I cannot see any parasites today&quot; rather than &quot;there are no parasites&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and acknowledging that a problem may have resulted from a previous infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In our clinical experience, it is important to neither dismiss patients&rsquo; complaints as trivial nor to overtly support unfounded beliefs and feed into their delusional system. Reassurance that the patient can be helped can be worthwhile. </p><p>Convincing patients to take antipsychotic medications is a major challenge in the management of this disorder. Rejection of a psychiatric basis for the dermopathy is a defining characteristic of the illness, thus rejection of psychiatric treatment is to be expected. A number of strategies have been suggested in prescribing antipsychotics for these patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One strategy is to tell the patient that the problem is a &quot;biochemical imbalance,&quot; possibly the result of a previous infection that is no longer present. Patients may be more likely to agree to take medication for treatment of a &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; than for a psychiatric problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It should be explained to the patient that although antipsychotic drugs are commonly used for schizophrenia, it is not being used for schizophrenia and the patient does not have the disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be further explained to the patient that drugs used for one purpose are often found to have additional unrelated uses. It is important to provide examples, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for pyrexia and stroke prevention, beta blockers for coronary artery disease and prevention of migraine headaches, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> for depression and neuritis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients may be persuaded to try medication when told that other patients with a similar condition have experienced great relief in their symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who ask why they continue to &quot;see&quot; parasites when others do not, the concept of the &quot;phantom limb&quot; may be presented as a possible explanation. </p><p/><p>Some clinicians recommend bypassing the disclosure of a delusional diagnosis to patients who are likely to respond by refusing the antipsychotic, thus protecting them from harm. This approach is controversial; clinicians also raised concerns about withholding information based on principles of patient autonomy and informed consent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>In the case of initial adverse drug events or failure of an antipsychotic drug, it is helpful to explain to the patient that it is important to find the &ldquo;right drug for the right patient,&rdquo; one that is both safe and effective. This explanation may help allay the patient&rsquo;s concerns or impatience when more than one drug regimen is necessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12625566\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO PHARMACOTHERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352928002\"><span class=\"h2\">New presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend first-line treatment of primary delusional infestation with an antipsychotic medication rather than other medications. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have not found convincing evidence that any antipsychotics are consistently more effective than any others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1788623157\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>In absence of differences in efficacy, we suggest selecting an antipsychotic that has a favorable side effect profile given the individual patient&rsquo;s clinical presentation. Antipsychotics vary widely in their side effect profiles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H944122200\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p>We favor second-generation antipsychotics rather than first-generation antipsychotics for first-line treatment of delusional infestation based on the generally lower rate of extrapyramidal side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with delusional infestation often respond to antipsychotic drugs at lower doses than patients with other psychotic disorders. The antipsychotic should be initiated at a low dose and increased gradually (eg, in weekly increments) to minimize side effects and arrive at the lowest effective daily dose. After achieving an adequate clinical response, the antipsychotic should be maintained at a therapeutic dose for at least one month, and preferably several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>As examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Risperidone</a> can be started at 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (given as one or two daily doses) and advanced weekly to the lowest clinically effective dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delusional-infestation-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis#H336726069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delusional infestation: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Secondary delusional infestation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with delusional infestation typically present in primary care or to a dermatologist. They usually are highly resistant to the idea of assessment by a psychiatrist. Whether in general medical care or psychiatric care, the development of a strong, therapeutic relationship instilling trust is central to clinical management. (See <a href=\"#H12625559\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Convincing patients to take antipsychotic medications is a major challenge in the management of this disorder. Rejection of a psychiatric basis for the dermopathy is a defining characteristic of the illness, thus rejection of psychiatric treatment is to be expected. (See <a href=\"#H12625559\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with primary delusional infestation, we recommend treatment with an antipsychotic medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Antipsychotic medications are associated with high treatment response rate; other therapies have not been systematically evaluated. (See <a href=\"#H12625566\" class=\"local\">'Approach to pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no rigorous evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimozide</a> or any antipsychotic has superior efficacy compared with any other. Pimozide, a first-generation antipsychotic that has been widely used in practice and published reports for delusional infestation, is no longer considered first-line treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1788623157\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In absence of differences in efficacy, we suggest selecting an antipsychotic that has a favorable side effect profile given the individual patient&rsquo;s clinical presentation. Antipsychotics vary widely in their side effect profiles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H352928002\" class=\"local\">'New presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with delusional infestation often respond to antipsychotic drugs at lower doses than patients with other psychotic disorders. The antipsychotic should be initiated at a low dose and increased gradually (eg, in weekly increments) to minimize side effects and arrive at the lowest effective daily dose. (See <a href=\"#H352928002\" class=\"local\">'New presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After achieving an adequate clinical response, the antipsychotic should be maintained at a therapeutic dose for at least one month, and preferably several months. (See <a href=\"#H1978179364\" class=\"local\">'Good response to antipsychotic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjustments to antipsychotic treatment in cases of poor response are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-acute-and-maintenance-phase-treatment#H16350492\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Acute and maintenance phase treatment&quot;, section on 'Poor response to initial treatment'</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-delusional-infestation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bewley AP, Lepping P, Freudenmann RW, Taylor R.
