Infants with ABE who presented in the first 48 hours of life had lower TB levels than those who presented after 48 hours.

The seven infants who died with lower TB had evidence of severe hemolysis and included six with Rhesus (Rh) incompatibility. In this select cohort of patients, multiple regression analyses demonstrated that sepsis, Rh incompatibility, and incremental TB increases of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (86 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> increased the risk of ABE.
