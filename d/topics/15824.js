SAD typically begins in childhood or adolescence and, untreated, can be associated with the subsequent development of major depression, substance abuse, and other mental health problems. The disorder can be associated with extensive functional impairment and reduced quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic addresses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis for SAD.

Their findings suggest that persons with circumscribed SAD, limited to performance situations, may have exaggerated autonomic nervous system responses to performance situations while those with more generalized SAD have autonomic responses similar to individuals without SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147157653\"><span class=\"h2\">CNS neurotransmitters and neuropeptides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in SAD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to reduce SAD symptoms, and experimental depletion of serotonin has been shown to reverse the benefit of these medications and to increase autonomic responses to fear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dopamine mediates incentive and reward function, which has been hypothesized to be abnormal in SAD.

Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated that persons with SAD, as a group, show hyperactivation of the amygdala and insula when engaging in public speaking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], or when viewing socially threatening images, such as emotional faces, but not when viewing non-social threatening images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other studies have found dysfunction in medial prefrontal cortex and medial parietal and occipital cortical regions associated with the default mode network, involved in self-reference and emotion regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147157674\"><span class=\"h2\">Temperament</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 15 percent of toddlers manifest a behaviorally inhibited temperament, characterized by a pattern of withdrawal, crying, and increased cortisol response when exposed in a laboratory setting to unfamiliar objects and people. This behavior is heritable and associated with amygdala hyperactivity in adulthood. The temperament of behavioral inhibition identifies a more severe subset of all children who might be considered shy, yet it does not of itself define a disorder. Prospective studies of these children have found that by teenage years, SAD is the most common psychiatric disorder to emerge in persons with this temperament, supporting behavioral inhibition as a risk factor for SAD. It also supports the clinical observation that SAD often arises out of pre-existing nonpathological shyness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23</a>].

Retrospective studies have reported that childhood maltreatment, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and neglect, is associated with a greater severity of SAD symptoms and impairment in functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other retrospective studies have identified hypercritical and overprotective parenting, and history of childhood teasing and other manifestations of childhood adversity to be associated with the disorder, although it is difficult to rule out the effects of recall bias in these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147157688\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive-behavioral factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cognitive-behavioral perspective has informed understanding of psychosocial factors in the development and maintenance of SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Persons with SAD have biased, negative cognitions about their own social performance, others&rsquo; perceptions of them, and the consequences of those perceptions. They show vigilance for signs of negative evaluation by others and tend to dwell on negative stimuli such as threatening faces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. They also tend to experience even objectively neutral responses as threatening rejection and indicating criticism. Persons with SAD also avoid social situations, or they attend but remain self-focused and not fully engaged in social interactions, which interferes with the development of their social skills and results in missed opportunities to disconfirm their excessive fears of being evaluated. Thus the social fears are reinforced in a vicious cycle.</p><p>Potential mechanisms for development of these cognitive biases include teaching by socially anxious parents, vicarious learning from observation, and conditioned learning, in which a previously neutral situation becomes associated with threat. In support of a conditioning mechanism, some patients do identify a socially traumatic incident as a precipitant of their disorder. Fear conditioning occurs when an originally neutral stimulus (ie, speaking in class) becomes an aversive experience through its pairing with an aversive unconditioned experience (ie, being criticized). In the laboratory, persons with SAD show a propensity to be more easily conditioned to develop fears of socially relevant stimuli, such as faces with neutral expressions, when they are paired with an aversive stimulus, such as critical faces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147157695\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmarks of social anxiety disorder (SAD) are excessive fears of scrutiny, embarrassment, and humiliation, although patients often manifest broader fears of social inadequacy and fears of criticism and negative evaluation by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In social or performance situations, persons with SAD may also experience physical manifestations of anxiety, include blushing, sweating, trembling, and palpitations, which sometimes can take the form of a full panic attack. </p><p>Persons often fear that others will notice that they are irrationally anxious. They also often experience anticipatory anxiety, worrying for hours or days prior to a feared event. A 2017 study also suggested that persons with SAD experience low levels of positive emotions, which may interfere with social connectedness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Persons with SAD may completely avoid some or most social activities, or they may participate with intense anxiety or with more subtle avoidance behaviors, such as limiting eye contact or the initiation of conversations. Upon leaving a social situation, persons with SAD often focus on their perceived shortcomings, berate themselves, and feel depressed. </p><p>SAD can present with social fears that extend across most interpersonal and performance situations, or with fears that are confined to performance situations (indicated using the performance-only specifier) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, evidence that these are discrete conditions is mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Most studies have found that the number of situations feared by persons with social anxiety disorder lies on a continuum rather than falling into a clear dichotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H341963059\" class=\"local\">'Subtypes'</a> below.)</p><p>Persons with performance-focused SAD often fear public speaking, or they may experience social anxiety in other situations in which a person may feel scrutinized and self-conscious, such as eating or drinking in public, or using a public urinal. Persons diagnosed with SAD not limited to performance situations have been shown to have more severe symptoms and impairment compared with individuals with the performance-only subtype of SAD, but the absence of established qualitative differences between the subtypes suggests that they represent a spectrum of disease severity rather than distinct syndromes. SAD subtypes may, however, provide clinically useful shorthand for prototypic forms of the disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180130\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidities</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147157716\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychiatric disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among persons with SAD, many psychiatric disorders co-occur at a prevalence greater than chance, including phobic disorders and other anxiety disorders (49 percent), affective disorders (38 percent), alcohol dependence (9 percent), eating disorders, and schizophrenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

A naturalistic study of patients 10 years after treatment for SAD found only one in three had experienced recovery, suggesting that the outcome of patients in community-based treatment lags behind findings from clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Conversely, it can also be helpful to identify the range of situations in which he or she does feel comfortable. Most persons with SAD have a social comfort zone, often including immediate family, perhaps a few close friends, or more. The prospect of treatment can be presented to the patient in the context of expanding this comfort zone to encompass a broader range of encounters and situations.</p><p>Persons with SAD often present with shy behavior in a diagnostic interview, appearing ill at ease, making little eye contact, and offering only brief answers to questions. Some may be reluctant to disclose symptoms of social anxiety, extending to the clinician their fears of embarrassment, being judged as irrational, or not taken seriously. An empathic clinical approach can help the socially anxious patient feel comfortable discussing his or her symptoms. To meet the diagnostic criteria for SAD, the syndrome must cause impairment in functioning or marked distress, and is not attributable to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256372839\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should actively ask patients presenting for mental health problems if they have problems with feeling shy or self-conscious. Patients may present for treatment of a condition comorbid with SAD, eg, major depression or substance abuse, but not disclose the social anxiety. (See <a href=\"#H147157716\" class=\"local\">'Psychiatric disorders'</a> above.)</p><p>Among tested screening instruments, the three-question Mini-Social Phobia Inventory appears useful for SAD. It has been found to have a high sensitivity (89 percent) and specificity (90 percent) for the DSM-IV generalized type of SAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. The questions ask, on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), how much the following problems have bothered you during the past week: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear of embarrassment causes me to avoid doing things or speaking to people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I avoid activities in which I am the center of attention</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being embarrassed or looking stupid are among my worst fears</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256373049\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis of SAD is established, it is useful to clarify the scope of social fears by systematically inquiring into fear and avoidance of common school, work, and social situations. Avoidance behavior tends to be the most impairing feature of SAD, so it is particularly important to investigate its scope and severity, and follow its response to treatment over time.</p><p>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, the most common SAD assessment instrument used in clinical trials, is suitable for monitoring patient response to treatment in routine patient care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The 24-item instrument assesses fear and anxiety in numerous common social and performance situations. The scale has good psychometric properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. It can be used for clinician assessment and for patient self-report. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147157737\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients can be diagnosed with SAD if they present with a marked, persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations involving exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others. Exposure typically provokes anxiety. The patient usually recognizes that their anxiety or fear is excessive (though young patients or those with longstanding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe symptoms may feel that their anxiety is reasonable given how aversive they find these situations, and judgment of the clinician is required to make this assessment). The patient tends to avoid feared situations or to endure them with distress.</p><p>The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder (SAD) are described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A. Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (eg, having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (eg, eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (eg, giving a speech).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interaction with adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (ie, will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C. The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>E. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>F. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for six months or more.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>G. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (eg, a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>J. If another medical condition (eg, Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341963059\"><span class=\"h2\">Subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specify if performance only &ndash; if the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public. </p><p>In the transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5, the subtypes of generalized and nongeneralized SAD were replaced by SAD and SAD, performance only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SAD &ndash; The principal criterion for the disorder is to have a marked, persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations involving exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others.

Persons with primary depression may lose interest in social activities, or experience social anxiety only when in a depressive episode, while persons with primary SAD usually maintain desire for social activities and report depressed moods secondary to their perceived social failures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/social-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

In SAD, the fear of being observed is primary, and anxiety is limited to the performance or encounter, or anticipating them.

Thus, a person with agoraphobia would be likely to feel more anxious on an empty bus, which lacks someone to provide assistance in the event of an anxiety episode, while a person with SAD would typically feel more anxious in the presence of other bus riders.

Its prevalence may be lower in developing countries. (See <a href=\"#H147157632\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SAD has a mean age of onset in the mid-teens, although it can occur as early as age five years. New onset of SAD after age 30 is uncommon, but can occur in the context of new social demands (eg, promotion to a job that requires public speaking). (See <a href=\"#H147157730\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Research studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of SAD.

(See <a href=\"#H147157639\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SAD co-occurs with many other psychiatric disorders, including avoidant personality disorder, major depression, alcohol dependence, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and other anxiety disorders. (See <a href=\"#H147157695\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental health clinicians should actively ask patients about symptoms of social anxiety. Individuals with SAD may be reluctant to disclose them to an evaluating clinician. This is consistent with the interpersonal fear and avoidance characteristics of the disorder.
