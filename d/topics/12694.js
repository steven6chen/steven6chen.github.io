The majority of routine, elective operations are performed in patients with normal hemostasis and with minimal blood loss. The two main categories of topical hemostatic agents are physical agents, which promote hemostasis using a passive substrate, and biologically active agents, which enhance coagulation at the bleeding site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H709637221\" class=\"local\">'Physical agents'</a> below and <a href=\"#H709637305\" class=\"local\">'Biologically active agents'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1853646219\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative bleeding is controlled using standard surgical techniques and electrocautery with the adjunctive use of topical hemostatic agents. </p><p>Electrocautery may not be useful for controlling bleeding in some surgical fields such as around nerves, medullary bone surfaces, needle-hole bleeding from vascular grafts, and raw areas on cut surfaces. </p><p>Patients who are anticoagulated and those with bleeding diatheses (eg, factor deficiencies, disseminated intravascular coagulation), or have platelet dysfunction (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy) can continue to ooze from surgical surfaces in spite of adequate surgical hemostasis. Under ideal circumstances, patients with hemostatic abnormalities have their underlying defects corrected prior to proceeding with surgery; however, this is not always possible. Anticoagulated patients, patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, and those with congenital or acquired bleeding diatheses may require emergency surgical procedures to manage trauma or unrelated conditions or to manage hemorrhage that is a result of their disorder. Under these circumstances, correction of the hemostatic defect is undertaken en route to or simultaneously with the procedure. </p><p>Hemostatic abnormalities can also develop during the course of surgery (eg, hypothermia, disseminated intravascular coagulation). The newer oral anticoagulant drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a> [Xarelto], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a> [Eliquis]), unlike <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, do not have a reversal agent.

(See <a href=\"#H1853648793\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects and complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709637221\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical agents promote hemostasis through several effects. The matrix material provides a stimulus that activates platelets and the extrinsic pathway and provides a scaffold for thrombus deposition. The dry matrix also absorbs water and concentrates hemostatic factors at the site of bleeding, and tamponades bleeding vessels by exerting pressure. The various physical agents include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709637255\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone wax and putty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood oozing from the cut surface of medullary bone is a common feature of median sternotomy, orthopedic, and neurosurgery procedures. Agents placed into the cut surface to minimize bleeding are made of natural or synthetic substances.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone wax</strong> &ndash; Bone wax, which is composed of beeswax, paraffin, and wax-softening agents, physically occludes bleeding vessels within bone to stop bleeding. When using bone wax, a minimal amount should be used and it is rubbed across the surface of the bone surface without leaving a raised plug. Bone wax is inexpensive and effective, but can lead to infection or granuloma formation which can interfere with bone healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In one retrospective study in neurosurgical patients, the incidence of surgical-site infection significantly decreased when bone wax was no longer used (14.2 versus 1.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ostene</strong> &ndash; Ostene is a wax-like compound of a water-soluble alkaline oxide copolymer that occludes bleeding vessels in bone similar to bone wax, but it does not persist in the wound as a foreign body. In animal studies comparing Ostene with bone wax, Ostene did not remain in the wound beyond three weeks and bone healing was more pronounced in the Ostene group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone putty</strong> &ndash; A resorbable hemostatic bone putty (Hemasorb Plus) is comprised of granular <span class=\"nowrap\">hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium</span> phosphate and water-soluble components that are fully synthetic and resorbable. It is available in moldable strips and in an applicator that does not require kneading.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709637269\"><span class=\"h3\">Dry matrix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dry agents form a matrix that activates the coagulation cascade and serves as a scaffold onto which thrombus can easily form. These agents are easy to use; however, they are less effective if bleeding is brisk. </p><p>The agent is applied to the site of bleeding followed by gentle pressure with a surgical sponge. Care must be taken in removing the sponge because these agents generally adhere to the underlying tissue and will remove the clot that has formed if removed too quickly. A useful technique for removal is wetting the sponge thoroughly and lifting the sponge from one edge slowly rolling the sponge off the clotted area. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801744470\"><span class=\"h4\">Oxidized regenerated cellulose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxidized-regnerated-cellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxidized regenerated cellulose</a> (ORC) is a dry, absorbable sterile mesh (eg, Surgicel) that can be applied directly to an area of bleeding. A single-layer sheet is fully absorbed in approximately 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Results are optimal if bleeding is minimal (ie, oozing). </p><p>ORC is commonly used to control bleeding at vascular anastomotic sites, the cut surfaces of solid organs, and retroperitoneal or pelvic surfaces after lymphadenectomy. Because ORC is pliable, it can be rolled and passed easily through laparoscopic trocars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>In vitro studies have found that ORC has bactericidal activity against a wide range of gram-positive and negative organisms because of its acidic pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The low pH also inhibits proteases and elastase, which may be beneficial in chronic wounds; however, this same property may inhibit its resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Residual ORC is associated with infection and adhesion formation. In one study of 360 patients with postoperative pelvic abscess, unabsorbed ORC was identified as a risk factor, and in some cases un-resorbed ORC was found at laparotomy more than 12 months after it was placed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H801744477\"><span class=\"h4\">Gelatin matrix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gelatin (eg, Gelfoam, Surgifoam) is a hydrocolloid made from acid partial hydrolysis of porcine-derived collagen that is whipped into foam and then dried. It is available in sponge or powder form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Gelatin sponge absorbs blood or fluid up to 40 times its weight and it expands up to 200 percent in its dimensions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The dry sponge form can be tailored to any shape and although rigid when dry, the sponge is pliable after moistening and passes easily through laparoscopic ports. Once in place, pressure is applied for several minutes to achieve hemostasis. The sponge can be left in place and is completely absorbed after four to six weeks.</p><p>Because gelatin foam has a neutral pH, it does not inactivate thrombin, and thus, it is common practice to moisten it with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombin-topical-human-and-bovine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical thrombin</a> to synergize the effects of these agents. The relative effectiveness of gelatin foam with or without thrombin has not been the subject of clinical trials. In a pig model of splenic laceration, gelatin foam without thrombin required two 20-second periods of finger pressure to stop breakthrough bleeding, while gelatin foam with thrombin needed only one 20-second period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>The disadvantages of gelatin include an increased incidence of infection, granuloma, and fibrosis formation, and, similar to dry matrix product, the potential for disruption of the clot if the sponge is removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25</a>]. Although all brands of gelatin matrix are derived from porcine connective tissue, it is not considered to be antigenic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709637276\"><span class=\"h4\">Microporous polysaccharide spheres</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microporous polysaccharide spheres (MPS) (eg, Arista) are derived from potato starch, which accelerates clot formation by acting as a molecular sieve to absorb water and concentrate platelets and blood proteins. MPS is available in powder form. </p><p>Microporous polysaccharide spheres are used by first applying pressure to the bleeding site with a dry surgical sponge for two minutes to achieve a relatively dry surface, then liberally applying the powder with the bellows applicator. Gentle pressure is reapplied with a fresh surgical sponge for one to two minutes until hemostasis is achieved.</p><p>The advantages of MPS include low cost, rapid absorption within 48 hours, and freedom from transmissible viruses or alloantigens. In addition, MPS does not act as a nidus for infection or cause foreign body reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. It has been approved for use in neurosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It can also be used with blood salvage circuits in conjunction with cell washing and the use of a 40 micron transfusion filter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709637298\"><span class=\"h4\">Microfibrillar collagen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microfibrillar collagen (MC) is an absorbable acid salt obtained from bovine collagen (eg, Avitene). MC acts as a scaffold for clot formation and activates platelets. MC can be applied directly to the bleeding site as a powder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], but foam sheet formulations (Avitene Ultrafoam) are available. MC is fully absorbed within three months. MC remains effective with heparinization, but is less effective when platelet counts are below <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span>. </p><p>Microfibrillar collagen is indicated for use in neurosurgery and urology, and also for providing hemostasis in vascular surgery. A manufacturer-sponsored single center trial (64 polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] arterial bypass graft anastomoses in 32 patients) found a significantly shorter time to hemostasis using microfibrillar collagen compared with oxidized, regenerated cellulose (125 versus 416 seconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>MC is contraindicated in blood scavenging systems because the fibers can pass through the filters causing embolization, and potentially disseminated intravascular coagulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2122485250\"><span class=\"h3\">External agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outside the operating room, in rescue or battlefield situations, external hemorrhage is generally controlled with direct pressure and standard dressings; however, when these are ineffective, external topical agents can be used as specialized dressings to temporize hemorrhage until definitive management is possible. A number of products have been used by the United States military to control external bleeding in the combat setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Available products include zeolite granules (eg, QuikClot), chitosan (eg, HemCon, Chitoflex), and self-expanding foams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Chitosan-impregnated gauze is available for civilian first-aid kits (eg, Allaquix, Curad Bloodstop). The effectiveness of, and the indications for, civilian use are not fully known at this time.</p><p>In the operating room, these agents should be removed under anesthesia, prior to prepping and draping unless there is a risk of severe, life-threatening hemorrhage upon removal of the dressing. In this situation, proximal vascular control should be obtained prior to removing the material. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248765939\"><span class=\"h4\">HemCon bandage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HemCon bandage is a dressing composed of lyophilized chitosan, a biodegradable complex carbohydrate derived from chitin. Its hemostatic function is attributed to the strong adhesive properties of chitosan, which attaches firmly to wet tissues and seals bleeding vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Successful use of this bandage as a hemostatic agent for prehospital combat casualties has been reported when standard methods were unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>This bandage has also been employed in a civilian emergency medical services system when conventional treatment (ie, pressure and gauze dressings) failed to control external bleeding wounds, or for obvious arterial bleeding. Results included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bandage controlled hemorrhage in 27 of 34 cases (79 percent), most often within three minutes of application.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bandage effectively controlled bleeding in 19 of the 25 cases in which direct pressure had initially failed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No adverse events or complications were reported. Proper training in the use of this bandage was considered essential, as user error was a contributing factor in most of the documented failures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H511194750\"><span class=\"h4\">ChitoFlex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ChitoFlex is a rolled version of chitosan in a different formulation than the HemCon bandage. It is very pliable and is designed to be packed into a wound tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2249912903\"><span class=\"h4\">QuikClot</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>QuikClot is a zeolite-based granule with 1 percent moisture that, when placed on a bleeding wound, absorbs water and concentrates red cells, platelets, and clotting proteins at the injury site, thereby promoting rapid coagulation and arresting hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The reaction releases significant amounts of heat, with the potential of causing thermal injury in some tissues, depending on the formulation used (granules, gauze, pad). </p><p>QuikClot in the form of a gauze or pad has been used in combat situations to control external bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], but its use among civilians is not well established.

Hemostasis is a dynamic process occurring in four general phases (initiation and formation of the platelet plug, propagation of the clotting through the coagulation cascade, termination of clotting by antithrombotic control mechanisms, and removal of the clot by fibrinolysis). These are discussed in detail elsewhere.

It can be applied using a sprayer, which is useful for managing diffuse bleeding from oozing peritoneal and pleural surfaces, or applied with a needle and syringe to direct its application to a specific area of bleeding. Topical thrombin can also be used in conjunction with a gelatin matrix agent (sponge or granules) that provides the thrombin with an immediate scaffold for clot formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>].

Due to its liquid nature, thrombin applied in combination with gelatin granules (eg, FloSeal, Surgiflo) may control bleeding more quickly than thrombin-soaked pieces of gelatin foam. (See <a href=\"#H1853649150\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness'</a> below.)</p><p>Urine does not significantly inhibit thrombin or thrombin-fibrin combination products. The urologic literature favors thrombin-based agents over dry matrix agents (and suture material), which can act as a nidus for stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>Human thrombin and a recombinant thrombin are available for use, largely replacing bovine thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Significant bleeding during surgery is controlled with vessel ligation, suturing, and electrocautery. Topical hemostatic agents are useful adjuncts to surgical hemostasis for controlling nonspecific bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H336519931\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical hemostatic agents work primarily by exerting physical effects or by enhancing existing hemostatic mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71852 \">table 1</a>). Physical agents include bone waxes, dry matrix agents, and external agents. Agents that enhance normal hemostatic mechanisms include thrombin-based products. (See <a href=\"#H1853646402\" class=\"local\">'Hemostatic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue adhesives can be used to promote hemostasis and are also used as an alternative to traditional closure of surgical incisions. Agents include cyanoacrylates, albumin-based adhesives, and polyethylene glycol hydrogels. Agents with adhesive qualities are most commonly used to close surgical skin incisions or minor wounds, but other applications in surgery have been investigated. For skin closure using cyanoacrylates, the risk of infection, cosmetic outcomes, and cost are similar between sutured closure and adhesive closure. However, sutured closure is associated with a lower risk of wound dehiscence and is quicker to accomplish. (See <a href=\"#H1853647927\" class=\"local\">'Tissue adhesives and sealants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects and complications from topical hemostatic agents and tissue adhesives are generally uncommon. Most problems can be avoided by limiting the amount of agent remaining within the wound once hemostasis has been achieved. Thrombin-based agents, which are blood products, have the potential for transmission of blood-borne disease, and anaphylaxis and immune-mediated coagulopathy are rare complications associated with bovine-derived agents. Other complications include embolism, infection, impaired wound healing, and thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H1853648793\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects and complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of which topical hemostatic agent to use depends upon the character, amount, and location of bleeding; the availability of a given agent; surgeon preference; and cost considerations. Dry matrix agents are less useful when bleeding is brisk. Fibrin sealant and bovine albumin-glutaraldehyde tissue adhesive (eg, Bioglue) are appropriate choices when moderate bleeding does not respond to other measures. (See <a href=\"#H336520109\" class=\"local\">'Choice of hemostatic agent'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1853649150\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-topical-hemostatic-agents-and-tissues-adhesives/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lai A, Davidson N, Galloway SW, Thachil J.
