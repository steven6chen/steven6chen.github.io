As extremity injuries are evaluated, each of four functional components (nerves, vessels, bones, and soft tissues) must be considered individually and together. If three of these four elements are injured, the patient has a &quot;mangled extremity&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Achieving the best outcome in patients with severe extremity injuries requires a multidisciplinary approach with oversight by the general or trauma surgeon and commitment from other specialists including orthopedic, vascular, and plastic surgeons as well as rehabilitation specialists. In most instances, limb salvage can be attempted even if the patient has a mangled extremity. However, at times, the injury to the extremity is so severe that primary amputation at the initial operation is required to save the patient's life. </p><p>The initial management of severe extremity injury will be reviewed here. The management of minor extremity injuries, including isolated fracture management, is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-bone-healing-and-fracture-description\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Bone healing and fracture description&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-acute-fracture-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of acute fracture management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-definitive-fracture-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of definitive fracture management&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151199079\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of extremity injuries ranges widely from falls and motor vehicle collisions to blast and fragmentation injuries. The nature and severity of extremity injuries differs between the military and civilian settings. Military extremity injuries are primarily due to penetrating or combined mechanisms, which are associated with high rates of open fracture and vascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In contrast, most severe extremity injuries in civilians are due to blunt trauma, but approximately 12 percent of civilian extremity injures occur as a result of penetrating or combined mechanisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1315120084\"><span class=\"h2\">Civilian</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Civilian extremity injuries occur most often due to falls (representing 50 to 60 percent of lower extremity injuries and 30 percent of upper extremity injuries), industrial or work-related accidents (up to 20 percent of upper extremity injuries), and motor vehicle crashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most upper extremity injuries occur as a result of using machinery or tools.</p><p>In civilians with nonfatal trauma, upper and lower extremity injuries are the most common reason for hospitalization, with more than one-third of those hospitalized having serious or limb-threatening injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In a systematic review of 3187 lower extremity injuries requiring vascular repairs, the overall secondary amputation rate was 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1315120091\"><span class=\"h2\">Military</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 percent of the injuries recorded in the Joint Theater Trauma Registry involve the extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Many soldiers with extremity injuries also have other serious life-threatening injuries that complicate limb salvage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In one series, 25 percent had an extremity injury associated with another serious nonextremity injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Most extremity wounds during combat have a penetrating component, typically resulting from explosions (81 percent) or gunshot wounds (17 percent). Only 2 percent of extremity injuries during combat are due to isolated blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Because of the predominantly penetrating mechanism and war environment, many of these injuries involve multiple functional components (bone, nerve, vessel and soft-tissue damage), resulting in a high rate of mangled extremities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151205216\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2012, 278,100 lower extremity injuries and 223,650 upper extremity injuries were entered into the civilian National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Traumatic injury in civilians results in an estimated 3700 major amputations annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. The contemporary incidence of extremity injuries during combat is lower than in previous recorded conflicts, representing approximately 50 percent of injuries, compared with approximately 59 percent during World War II, 60.2 percent during the Korean War, and 61.1 percent in the Vietnam War [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The presence of an open fracture significantly increases the risk of osteomyelitis and, ultimately, limb loss depending upon the severity of injury to the associated soft tissues. Open fractures occur in approximately 3 percent of long bone fractures for an annual incidence of between 11.5 and 13 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The long bone that is most commonly involved in open fracture is the tibia. In one study, 24 percent of tibial fractures were open [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. High-energy motor vehicle collisions were responsible for 58 percent of these injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Associated vascular injuries occur in &lt;1 percent of all civilian fractures (0.4 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The risk of vascular injury increases with increasing injury severity. In retrospective reviews, the incidence of vascular injury was cited at 5 percent for severe fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and 6.6 percent for penetrating extremity injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Among patients with arterial injury, bony injuries were present in 43 percent of patients, in a five-year retrospective review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Venous injuries occurred in 20 percent of the patients studied.</p><p>The presence of a vascular injury also increases the risk for limb loss. In a contemporary combat review (2002 to 2009), 1570 patients with vascular injuries were identified out of 13,076 casualties (12 percent). Of these, 79 percent involved the upper and lower extremities. Isolated extremity arterial injuries were documented in 63 percent, isolated extremity venous injuries in 15 percent, and combined arterial and venous injuries in 22 percent. Rates of vascular injury in prior conflicts ranged from 1 percent in World War II to 2 to 3 percent in Korea and Vietnam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122605634\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTREMITY ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowledge of extremity anatomy and functional physiology is important for proper preoperative and postoperative extremity assessment. The anatomy of the upper and lower extremity is reviewed elsewhere.

The initial resuscitation and evaluation of the patient with blunt or penetrating head, thoracic, or abdominal trauma is discussed in detail elsewhere. Resuscitation and management of these life-threatening injuries takes precedence over the extremity injury.

However, because prolonged application of direct pressure, particularly bleeding from junctional vessels, is not practical during transport in the prehospital or tactical environment, other approaches have been used including topical agents, external compression clamps, and endovascular occlusion devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These methods are not widely accepted in mainstream civilian clinical practice but have been endorsed by the American College of Surgeons in the prehospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Hemorrhage control'</a>.)</p><p>Bleeding can also be controlled using a tourniquet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>] or direct clamping of visible vessels. Clamping vessels that cannot be clearly identified should <strong>not</strong> be performed. Pneumatic tourniquets are commonly used to lessen bleeding during the course of upper and lower extremity surgery. There is renewed interest in the civilian community in the use of tourniquets for control of extremity hemorrhage. ATLS endorses the judicious use of a tourniquet for major extremity arterial hemorrhage, and several civilian guidelines now include tourniquet application as a temporary adjunct to control extremity hemorrhage when direct pressure is unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/19,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23,24</a>] or during tactical civilian events, which are situations where ballistic or explosive wounds are possible (eg, an active shooter standoff) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Hemorrhage control'</a>.)</p><p>A variety of tourniquets have been developed to manage combat-related extremity hemorrhage with a low risk of ischemia and neurologic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT), Emergency and Medical Tourniquet (EMT), and Special Operations Forces Tactical Tourniquet (SOFTT) meet the effectiveness standard of the United States military and occlude distal flow in &gt;80 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

Some patients may benefit from immediate surgical exploration and others from digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) rather than CT angiography. Every effort should be made to avoid an algorithm that exposes the patient to excessive radiation and intravenous contrast load such as CT angiography followed by DSA, which usually occurs in the context of seeking to better define subtle irregularities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

The sensitivity of helical CT angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction ranges from 90 to 100 percent, with specificities &gt;99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].

Three-dimensional reconstruction is not an absolute requirement with higher-slice scanners. We use a 64-slice scanner without reconstruction but consider it ideal to have the trauma or vascular surgeon review the cross-sectional images together with the radiologist. </p><p>CT angiography is often preferred in patients with multiple trauma because it is less invasive than conventional arteriography and can be performed at the same time as head, chest, or abdominal CT, which are frequently needed in trauma patients. As a single study, CT angiography is less expensive than conventional arteriography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, the cost of additional studies to sort out nondiagnostic findings on CT angiography and the cost of unnecessary surgical explorations or other interventions based upon the results of CT angiography need to be taken into account. As an example, in a study of 132 patients with penetrating trauma, 59 patients underwent CT angiography, of which 28 were performed as a completion of a <span class=\"nowrap\">head/chest/abdominal</span> series and 31 were for isolated extremity injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Ten percent of the studies were indeterminate with two of these patients requiring exploration. There was no difference in the rate of indeterminate studies between whole body studies and those done for isolated extremity injury.</p><p>Conventional DSA may be preferred initially in some patients and can be performed in a dedicated interventional suite or in the operating room. Arteriography in the operating room has the advantage of eliminating unnecessary patient transport. A hybrid operating room (operating suite with interventional capabilities) is ideal but not necessary. Intraoperative arteriography can be performed using a portable power injector and portable digital subtraction arteriography, which are generally available in the operating room at civilian and military hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151204470\"><span class=\"h2\">Soft tissue and bone assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The soft tissue envelope of muscle, subcutaneous fat, and skin should be evaluated for signs that indicate a potential underlying fracture and to assess the severity of soft tissue damage, which is important for determining the potential risk of limb loss. </p><p>The soft tissue injury should identify areas of missile entry and exit, soft tissue avulsion, skin or muscle flap formation, and evidence of contamination. In penetrating injuries, such as high-velocity gunshot wounds or fragmentation injuries, the external wound may be relatively small; however, underlying soft tissue destruction can be significant. </p><p>Rotational (shearing) injuries to the extremities can avulse the skin and subcutaneous fat off the underlying tissues, which are termed degloving injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. These can be classified as pure degloving injuries involving the skin only (open or closed), those that involve the deep soft tissues, and those associated with long-bone fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Traumatic separation of the skin and subcutaneous tissues from the underlying fascia without a break in the skin constitutes a closed degloving injury (Morel-Lavallee, post-traumatic seroma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Closed degloving occurs most frequently overlying the hip and in the proximal thigh. Free-floating segments of skin and soft tissue can become ischemic and slough completely, resulting in large areas of soft tissue loss that must then be skin grafted.

Extremity injuries with suspected joint space involvement (traumatic arthrotomy) can be further evaluated by injecting the joint with saline (ie, saline load test). However, using CT may be preferred unless it is not available or not practical. In one study of 62 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of CT for detecting a traumatic open arthrotomy at the knee was significantly higher compared with the saline load test (100 versus 92 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. An additional advantage of CT is the ability to detect open periarticular knee fracture. In one study, CT altered the fracture classification in 48 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. When a saline load test is used, the joint should be assessed to identify any distension and the associated wound or laceration evaluated for fluid extravasation. Available studies indicate that as much as 194 mL of saline may need to be injected to achieve 95 percent sensitivity for identifying traumatic arthrotomy of the knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. In a retrospective study of the saline load test used in 50 trauma patients at risk for a traumatic arthrotomy of the knee, the at-risk joint was loaded until fluid was noted to extravasate from the wound or to the maximum volume tolerated by the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. This technique resulted in a sensitivity of 94 percent and a negative predictive value of 97 percent with injected volumes ranging from 40 to 180 mL.</p><p>The muscle compartments of the affected extremity should also be evaluated on initial exam. Soft tissue injury and swelling can result in compartment syndrome. The lower extremity is more prone to compartment syndrome compared with the upper extremity because of its greater muscle mass and possibly because of its dependent position.

High-energy and penetrating injuries can also lead to combined bony, vascular, and soft tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Guidelines for the management of complex extremity injuries prepared by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma ad hoc Committee on Outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], supplemented by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], cite the following as factors that increase the risk for limb loss:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delay in revascularization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt trauma </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-velocity penetrating trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower extremity versus upper extremity vascular involvement (especially popliteal artery)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated injuries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age and older physiologic health</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shock and obvious limb ischemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forward combat zone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resource-limited environment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multi-casualty event</p><p/><p>A study of the National Trauma Data Bank in the United States noted that high-energy trauma mechanisms, crush injury at or above the knee, systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg in the Emergency Department, and severe head injury independently predicted amputation within the first hospital day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Lower extremity injuries requiring vascular repair have a high rate of amputation. Amputation rates are higher for blunt compared with penetrating injury. For below-the-knee arterial injuries, the need for amputation correlates with the number of vessels injured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. In a systematic review, other factors that increase the risk of amputation include major soft tissue injury (26 versus 8 percent for no soft tissue injury), associated fracture (14 versus 2 percent), and mechanism of injury (blast: 19 percent, blunt: 16 percent, penetrating: 5 percent). In this review, shock and nerve or venous injuries were not significant prognostic factors for secondary amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The MESS is best used alongside clinical exam and patient comorbidities to help in the decision for or against limb salvage. A low score suggests limb salvage potential; however, a high score does <strong>not</strong> reliably predict the need for eventual amputation. </p><p>The Lower Extremity Assessment Program (LEAP) investigators evaluated 556 patients with lower extremity injuries using five injury severity scoring systems, including MESS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Each of the scoring systems were highly specific (0.84 to 0.98) but not sensitive (0.37 to 0.67) for predicting limb loss. Specifically, regarding the MESS, these authors found that a MESS of 7 had a sensitivity of 0.45 but a specificity of 0.93 for predicting amputation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122607470\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a severe extremity injury has been identified, a management plan should be developed taking into consideration the patient's other injuries. In multiply injured trauma patients, the management plan should be made by one lead surgeon in collaboration with the orthopedic, vascular, and neurosurgery services, as needed. The priority of, timing to, and approach to each injury should be determined in advance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909593032\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamically unstable</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles, the hemodynamically unstable trauma patient with indications for surgery (eg, positive Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma [FAST], hard signs of vascular injury) should be taken to the operating room to identify and control bleeding. Life-threatening injuries to the head, neck, chest, or abdomen take precedence over the extremity injury. A damage control or staged approach to the injured extremity is warranted once external bleeding from the extremity is controlled. In some cases, the severity of the extremity injury or time constraints due to the need to manage life-threatening injuries will preclude meaningful attempts at limb salvage, and primary amputation may be the best option. If the extremity is the primary (or only) injury, a more definitive approach to repair can be taken at the outset. (See <a href=\"#H151207128\" class=\"local\">'Hard signs of arterial injury'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-severe-extremity-injury#H909588550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of severe extremity injury&quot;, section on 'Damage control surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909593039\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamically stable with vascular injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For hemodynamically stable patients, the timing of the management of extremity injury when vascular injury is present depends upon the degree and duration of ischemia. Patients with hard signs of vascular injury should be taken immediately to the operating room for evaluation and management. Patients with clinical signs of arterial injury, including an injured extremity index (IEI) &lt;0.9, should be evaluated using computed tomographic (CT) angiography or conventional arteriography depending upon institutional resources. In the presence of bony instability, arterial revascularization is fraught with difficulties. Under these circumstances, arterial shunting, if needed, and fracture stabilization followed by definitive vascular repair once the bones have been stabilized may be the most appropriate sequence of care.

Multiple debridement procedures are frequently required before definitive fracture fixation and soft tissue coverage can be achieved.

Most of these complications require or prolong hospitalization or require additional operative treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. These complications are discussed elsewhere.

Mortality correlates to the volume of blood lost as a result of the extremity injury, which can be significant with injuries involving the junctional vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-extremity-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Higher mortality rates reflect more severe extremity injury, coexistent injury, and development of complications (eg, venous thromboembolism).

Civilian extremity injuries are most commonly due to blunt mechanisms, whereas combat injuries are predominantly due to penetrating or mixed mechanisms. In combat, extremity injuries are present in one-half of all casualties. (See <a href=\"#H1315120070\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H151205216\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H151199079\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A brief extremity exam is performed during the initial trauma assessment (primary survey) but should be repeated once life-threatening injuries have been addressed. The extremity evaluation should be structured to assess the four functional components of the extremity (nerves, vessels, bones, soft tissues). Injury to three of these four elements constitutes a &quot;mangled extremity.&quot; Patients with extremity deformity, point tenderness, ecchymosis, deep laceration, laceration near a joint, or joint laxity should undergo plain radiographs to evaluate for extremity fracture. (See <a href=\"#H122605471\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients <strong>with</strong> hard signs of a vascular injury (eg, pulsatile bleeding, an expanding hematoma, distal ischemia) should be taken directly to the operating room for further examination and management. Direct pressure is usually effective in controlling extremity hemorrhage. For extremity hemorrhage that is not adequately controlled with direct pressure, we suggest placement of an extremity tourniquet (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Although not widely used for civilian injuries, military experience with prehospital and emergency department tourniquet application has shown that tourniquets save lives with a low rate of complications. (See <a href=\"#H151199357\" class=\"local\">'Control of hemorrhage'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Hemorrhage control'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients <strong>without</strong> hard signs of vascular injury, an injured extremity index (IEI) should be performed, which is analogous to the ankle-brachial index (ABI). An abnormal IEI (&lt;0.9) suggests the presence of a vascular injury. Hemodynamically stable patients with an abnormal IEI should undergo further imaging to exclude vascular injury. Arteriography is often performed using computed tomographic (CT) angiography because it is less invasive than conventional arteriography; has high sensitivity and specificity; and can be performed at the same time as head, chest, or abdominal CT, which are frequently needed. Where an appropriately sensitive CT scanner is not immediately available, conventional arteriography can be performed to exclude vascular injury either in a dedicated interventional suite or in the operating room. (See <a href=\"#H151207135\" class=\"local\">'Injured extremity index'</a> above and <a href=\"#H235776174\" class=\"local\">'Arteriography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every effort should be made to salvage the limb if there is no clear indication for primary amputation. An attempt to salvage a mangled extremity is reasonable in most instances; however, in a patient with severe multisystem injuries and a mangled extremity, a primary amputation may be indicated to save the patient's life. Although clinical scoring systems can indicate when limb salvage is likely to be successful, these are not accurate for determining the need for emergent primary amputation. Following every initial limb salvage attempt, the extremity should be reevaluated in the short term for signs of sensorimotor function and tissue viability. Factors that increase the risk of limb loss include lower extremity vascular injury, delayed revascularization, blunt or high-velocity mechanism, multiple additional injuries, advanced age and multiple comorbidities, shock and obvious limb ischemia, and a severe extremity injury sustained in a resource-limited environment or during a mass casualty event.
