It has evolved as an alternative to overnight, attended, in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) in selected patients.</p><p>Advantages of HSAT include its convenience (it can be performed in the patient's home or in a hospital room) and its potential to lower costs, since most HSAT devices are less costly than complete polysomnography systems and the attendance of a technologist is not required. A disadvantage is that for most of these devices, fewer physiologic variables are measured than with PSG, which can lead to misinterpretation of the results. Other advantages and disadvantages are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67817 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines state that results from HSAT can be used to support a prescription for positive airway pressure therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) has also released clinical practice guidelines to guide clinicians in the use of HSAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The use of HSAT in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected OSA is reviewed here. The diagnostic approach to a patient with suspected OSA is described separately.

Type 1 is an in-laboratory polysomnogram that cannot be performed at home.

These devices are not used for home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polysomnography-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polysomnography in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H771362863\"><span class=\"h2\">Home devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several devices for home sleep apnea testing are available. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine considers an adequate device as one that incorporates a minimum of the following sensors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest and abdominal respiratory inductance plethysmography</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oximetry</p><p/><p>Alternatively, devices that use peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) with oximetry and actigraphy are appropriate.</p><p>In essence, providers should choose HSAT devices that have been validated against PSG, utilize an oxygen saturation sensor, AND measure respiratory events with a minimum of one airflow and effort sensor or peripheral arterial tonometry or another validated measure of respiratory disturbance. As newer devices come on the market, these minimal parameters should be sought.</p><p>The United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines do not make any specific recommendations about which type of home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) device should be used, nor do they specify the appropriate population to undergo HSAT. However, they do indicate that positive airway pressure therapy prescriptions will be covered by Medicare and Medicaid only if OSA is diagnosed using a type 1, 2, or 3 device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, a Type 4 device that measures at least three variables is acceptable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Type 2 devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 2 monitoring devices can record the same variables as type 1 devices. The major difference from type 1 devices is that they can be used outside of the sleep laboratory and a technologist is not present during the recording (ie, they are unattended studies).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Type 3 devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 3 monitoring devices typically measure between four and seven physiologic variables, including two respiratory variables (eg, respiratory effort and airflow), a cardiac variable (eg, heart rate or an electrocardiogram), and arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation via pulse oximetry. Some devices have additional signals that can detect snoring, determine body position, or detect movement. Sleep variables (eg, sleep stages, sleep continuity) are typically not measured by a type 3 device, although some newer devices have methods for estimating sleep (eg, actigraphy). A technologist is typically not present during the recording and real-time visualization of the signals is usually not available.</p><p>Recordings from a typical type 3 portable monitoring device are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F77569\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77569 \">figure 1</a>). In this example, respiratory effort is detected by a chest wall impedance monitor, airflow is detected by a heat-sensitive thermistor at the nose and mouth, and oxyhemoglobin saturation is measured by a pulse oximeter. The heart rate is derived from the pulse oximetry signal. Measurement of these variables is generally sufficient to detect most apneas (obstructive, central, mixed) and hypopneas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1132781603\"><span class=\"h4\">Limitations compared with PSG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 3 devices have important limitations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 3 devices do not typically detect arousals from sleep because they do not include electroencephalography (EEG). As a result, arousals related to sleep-disordered breathing events (including respiratory effort related arousals [RERAs]) cannot be detected. The inability to detect respiratory related arousals may lead to underestimation of the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) and under-recognition of cases of OSA in which RERAs are the predominant feature. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults#H86030606\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;, section on 'Respiratory disturbance index'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sleep disordered breathing index derived from an HSAT device differs from the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) during PSG. The AHI is calculated by dividing the number of apneas and hypopneas by total sleep time, whereas the HSAT index divides by total recording time. As a result, the index derived from HSAT is usually lower than an AHI derived by PSG. This decreases the diagnostic sensitivity of type 3 devices compared with type 1 and 2 devices. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) has suggested using the term &quot;respiratory event index&quot; (REI) as an alternative to AHI when referring to the index derived from HSAT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some type 3 devices do not record position, so they may not be able to detect when the patient is lying in the supine or lateral decubitus position. Thus, OSA that develops or worsens in the supine position may not be detected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most type 3 devices cannot distinguish rapid eye movement (REM) sleep from non-REM (NREM) sleep because they do not include EEG monitoring. As a result, the interpreting clinician cannot be certain that a period of REM sleep was captured during the study. This is an important limitation because severe perturbations are most common during REM sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Type 4 devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 4 monitoring devices are defined differently by different organizations. The AASM originally defined type 4 monitoring devices as devices that record one or two variables (eg, arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation and airflow) and can be used without a technician. These devices are called continuous single or dual bioparameter devices. In contrast, the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines include devices that measure three variables as type 4 monitoring devices. A technologist is not present during the recording.</p><p>Type 4 devices that record one or two variables provide limited information. Pulse oximetry and airflow are the physiological variables that are most commonly measured. As a result, derived information typically includes the frequency of apneas, frequency of hypopneas, AHI, baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), mean SpO<sub>2</sub>, frequency of oxyhemoglobin desaturation, duration of oxyhemoglobin desaturation, degree of oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and nadirs of SpO<sub>2</sub>. All of the limitations of type 3 devices described above also apply to type 4 devices. (See <a href=\"#H1132781603\" class=\"local\">'Limitations compared with PSG'</a> above.)</p><p>A novel CMS-defined type 4 device measures arterial tonometry, oximetry, snoring, actigraphy, and body position. It uses an automated algorithm to detect breathing events based upon peripheral arterial tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. This device provides an apnea hypopnea index (pAHI) and respiratory disturbance index (pRDI) corresponding with the validated algorithm that is utilized in calculating sleep disordered breathing events using the peripheral arterial tonometry signal.</p><p>Pulse oximetry alone is also considered a type 4 device, which is discussed further below. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pulse oximetry'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3478043\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative classification scheme for HSAT devices has been proposed, the SCOPER categorization system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The acronym SCOPER stands for <strong>S</strong>leep, <strong>C</strong>ardiovascular, <strong>O</strong>ximetry, <strong>P</strong>osition, <strong>E</strong>ffort, and <strong>R</strong>espiration. The SCOPER categorization system provides a more detailed description of the type of physiologic parameters that are being measured and how they are being measured than traditional classification schemes. The system is described in detail in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F85891\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85891 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>As an example of how the SCOPER system is applied, consider a device that measures actigraphy, derives the pulse rate from the oximetry, measures oximetry with an adequate sampling rate, uses a mercury position sensor, measures effort via a piezo belt, and measures respiration via a thermocouple; this device would have a SCOPER designation of S<sub>3</sub>C<sub>4</sub>O<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2</sub>E<sub>4</sub>R<sub>3</sub>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common indications for home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) include the diagnostic evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and assessment of treatment of OSA (positive airway pressure therapy, oral appliance, post surgery).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many HSAT devices have been validated against standard polysomnography (PSG), typically by testing the same patient with both modalities in the sleep laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. A wide range of diagnostic characteristics have been reported using HSAT, but the sensitivity and specificity seem to be high in populations considered by sleep specialists to be at high risk of moderate to severe OSA on the basis of clinical symptoms, assuming there are no comorbid medical disorders or sleep disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,16</a>]. However, retrospective data suggest that HSAT may underestimate OSA severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Clinical practice guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) provide the following guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/2-4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidacy </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Patients who are suitable candidates for HSAT</strong> &ndash; HSAT can be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with a high pre-test probability of moderate to severe OSA. Risk of moderate to severe OSA is indicated by the presence of daytime hypersomnolence, and at least two of the following three criteria: habitual loud snoring, witnessed apnea or <span class=\"nowrap\">gasping/choking,</span> or diagnosed hypertension.

According to this manual, HSAT reports should include a respiratory event index (REI), which is the number of respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">events/monitoring</span> time (in hours), or an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) if the device records sleep with EEG. When using devices that measure airflow and effort, the scoring of events is the same as for PSG, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Apnea &ndash; &ge;90 percent reduction in peak signal excursion of the airflow sensor for &ge;10 seconds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypopnea &ndash; &ge;30 percent reduction in airflow sensor lasting for &ge;10 seconds and associated with a 3 percent oxygen desaturation (CMS rule for hypopnea requires a 4 percent oxygen desaturation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For devices measuring peripheral arterial tone (PAT), identification of events should be based on the PAT, oxygen desaturation, and heart rate changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

As a result, the pretest clinical suspicion for OSA and the results of HSAT studies should always be considered together. Additional testing is indicated whenever there is a reasonable clinical suspicion for OSA, but the HSAT study is negative. One retrospective study showed that 24 percent of patients with a negative HSAT who were subsequently studied with PSG were positive for OSA, and those positive OSA patients tended to be over the age of 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some HSAT devices cannot distinguish obstructive and central events, in part because respiratory effort is not measured.

Many devices do not allow the raw data to be viewed by the provider who ordered the test because the scoring algorithm is proprietary. This is problematic according to numerous studies that showed that manual scoring or manual editing of automated scoring improves diagnostic accuracy compared with automated scoring alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>]. Clinical practice guidelines recommend manual scoring or manual editing of automated scoring.</p><p/><p>The failure rate of HSAT devices ranges from as low as 3 percent to as high as 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Technical failures can be reduced by adequately educating patients on how to apply the device, using a device that is simple to apply, and giving the patient the ability to call someone if they encounter a problem when setting up the device. Guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommend that if a single HSAT is negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate that polysomnography should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Titration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HSAT has a potential role for determining the initial level of positive airway pressure therapy, although not all monitoring devices interface with PAP devices, and third-party reimbursement for this indication is not standard.

The approach is similar to that for diagnosis and titration, respectively. HSAT is appropriately used to retest a patient after surgery for OSA, after initial use and adjustment of a dental (oral) appliance to treat OSA, or to reassess a patient with OSA after weight loss or weight gain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PULSE OXIMETRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulse oximetry is a widely accepted and important component of both polysomnography (PSG) and home sleep apnea testing (HSAT). However, when it is measured alone or with only one other variable, it is not recommended for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1,2,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,29</a>]. In this section, we briefly describe the reason that overnight oximetry alone is not considered an acceptable diagnostic modality.</p><p>The characteristics of overnight pulse oximetry alone (or pulse oximetry performed during a daytime sleep period, for individuals who are shift workers) as a diagnostic test are highly dependent upon whether the criteria used to define a positive test are quantitative or qualitative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overnight pulse oximetry when used for OSA should report an &quot;oxygen desaturation index&quot; (ODI), which is the number of oxygen desaturations (typically 3 or 4 percent drops) divided by the total recording time. Pulse oximetry tends to have a high specificity but a low sensitivity for OSA when quantitative criteria are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. As an example, a study of 200 patients with suspected OSA compared overnight pulse oximetry versus polysomnography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Positive overnight pulse oximetry was defined as a decrease in the oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of 4 percent or greater from baseline, to a value 90 percent or lower. Overnight pulse oximetry had a sensitivity of 41 percent and a specificity of 97 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, overnight pulse oximetry tends to have a high sensitivity but a low specificity when qualitative criteria are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Qualitative criteria emphasize pattern recognition. The overnight pulse oximetry strip is printed and visually analyzed for a pattern of multiple, short-duration fluctuations of the SpO<sub>2</sub>. No specific level of desaturation is required for a positive study. As an example, a study of 240 patients with suspected OSA compared overnight pulse oximetry versus polysomnography. Positive overnight pulse oximetry was defined as greater than 10 fluctuations of SpO<sub>2</sub> per hour of sleep. The sensitivity and specificity of overnight pulse oximetry were 98 and 48 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p>Overnight pulse oximetry alone can be either a sensitive or a specific test for OSA, but not both. As a result, either false-positive or false-negative tests will be common, depending on the criteria chosen to define a positive test. Despite these limitations, however, review of pulse oximetry during sleep can be a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in selected settings, such as in children who are not able to comply with formal sleep testing or in the inpatient setting.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT), also referred to as out-of-center sleep testing or portable monitoring, is an acceptable approach to the diagnostic evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, it should only be used for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected OSA in patients with a high pre-test probability of having moderate to severe OSA and no comorbid medical or sleep disorders. Patients not suitable for HSAT are those with comorbid medical conditions (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] stage II or higher, heart failure) or comorbid sleep disorders (eg, central sleep apnea, hypersomnia disorders, insomnia, parasomnias, or periodic limb movement disorder). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HSAT can also be used to evaluate the efficacy of an oral appliance or upper airway surgery for OSA. Another potential use is to guide the titration of positive airway pressure therapy if the chosen mode of positive airway pressure is either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or autotitrating positive airway pressure. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Reassessment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Titration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several types of HSAT devices. Type 3 and 4 devices have highly variable diagnostic performance and most do not include a conventional measure of sleep, which has many drawbacks. This was supported by a technology evaluation that found that some devices clearly perform better than others. The SCOPER categorization system provides a more detailed description of individual devices than traditional categorization schemes. An adequate device is one that, at minimum, measures nasal pressure, chest and abdominal respiratory inductance plethysmography, and oximetry. Alternatively, devices that use peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) with oximetry and actigraphy are appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of monitoring devices'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse oximetry is a widely accepted and important component of both polysomnography and HSAT. However, it should NOT be used alone for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected OSA. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pulse oximetry'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
