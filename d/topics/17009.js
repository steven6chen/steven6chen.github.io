It is sometimes called &quot;lockjaw&quot; because muscle spasms can clench the jaw shut.</p><p>Tetanus is caused by bacteria (germs) that live in the soil. They can get into your body through a cut or scrape. Most people in the United States are protected from these bacteria because they have gotten vaccines against them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28987372\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of tetanus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff jaw or neck muscles, which make it hard to move your jaw or neck normally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strange-looking smile that does not go away when you try to relax your mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tight, painful muscles that do not let go when you try to relax them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing, swallowing, or both</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling irritable or restless</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating even when you are not exercising or hot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heartbeat that is faster than usual, or irregular heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful muscle spasms</p><p/><p>People who are very sick with tetanus can have muscle spasms that force the body into a &quot;bridge&quot; position. They might have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clenched fists</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back arched off the floor or bed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Legs stretched out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arms moving back and forth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing &ndash; They might even stop breathing during a muscle spasm.</p><p/><p>Some people with tetanus have tight muscles and muscle spasms in just one part of the body. For example, they might have stiff, hard belly muscles. Tetanus in the head or neck can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiff jaw or neck muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pain in the face or head</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28987387\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get a puncture wound, for example from a nail that goes through your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get a cut, scrape, or other injury you cannot clean completely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have an injury that leaves something (like a nail or glass) inside your body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An animal bites you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have diabetes, and get a sore on your foot, leg, or other place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a stiff jaw or neck, other tight muscles you cannot relax, or painful muscle spasms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have trouble breathing or swallowing.</p><p/><p>It is especially important to see a doctor or nurse if you get a puncture wound or animal bite and your last tetanus shot was 5 years ago or longer, or if you do not remember getting a tetanus shot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28987402\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for tetanus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no simple test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and vaccine history, and by doing an exam. This infection is most likely in people who have had an injury and who have not had the tetanus vaccine at all or not had the right vaccine boosters.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28987416\"><span class=\"h1\">Is tetanus dangerous?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. People with tetanus need to go to the hospital, and some people even die from it. The muscle spasms can stop your breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28987433\"><span class=\"h1\">How is tetanus treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors treat tetanus in the hospital, sometimes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleaning cuts or scrapes to remove skin and tissue that could have tetanus bacteria on it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving medicines to fight the infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving a tetanus vaccine booster</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving medicine and other treatments to reduce muscle spasms, breathing problems, pain, and other symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a ventilator (breathing machine) if you have trouble breathing on your own</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a feeding tube if you cannot eat or drink on your own</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having physical therapy to help muscles recover</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28987448\"><span class=\"h1\">Can tetanus be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To reduce your chances of getting tetanus, do these things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a tetanus vaccine. This is a medicine that teaches your body how to fight tetanus. Most children growing up in the United States get this vaccine as part of their routine childhood vaccines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get regular tetanus booster shots. Adults should get tetanus booster shots every 10 years. For bad wounds, you will need to get a tetanus booster shot if you haven't had one in the last 5 years. If you have a bad wound and you haven't received all of your tetanus vaccines or you are not sure if you have, you will need a tetanus booster shot and another shot to fight any tetanus bacteria that got in the wound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash cuts or scrapes with soap and water and use antibiotic ointment on them. See a doctor or nurse if you cannot get all the dirt out or cannot see all the way into the wound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do NOT inject illegal drugs, or at least use clean needles if you do inject drugs or anything else.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28987463\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-care-of-cuts-and-scrapes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking care of cuts and scrapes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=animal-and-human-bites-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Animal and human bites (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?
