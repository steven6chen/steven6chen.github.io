Although it is more common in older women, it can affect younger women as well. It is <strong>not</strong> a normal part of aging or something that you just have to live with.</p><p>This article discusses the different types of leakage and the tests that may be done during your evaluation. The treatment of incontinence and frequency is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-treatments-for-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary incontinence treatments for women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about incontinence is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF URINARY INCONTINENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common types of urine leakage in women are stress incontinence and urgency incontinence. Incontinence may be caused or worsened by medical problems, medications, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> problems with the brain due to a stroke or dementia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H354606798\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress incontinence occurs when the muscles and tissues around the urethra (where urine exits) do not stay closed properly when there is increased pressure (&quot;stress&quot;) in the abdomen, leading to urine leakage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F116081\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116081 \">figure 1</a>). As an example, coughing, sneezing, laughing, or running can cause stress incontinence. Stress incontinence is a common reason for incontinence in women, especially those who are obese or have given birth by vaginal delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Urgency incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In people with urgency incontinence (also called overactive bladder), there is a sudden, uncontrollable urge to urinate. You may leak urine on the way to the toilet. Common triggers of urgency incontinence include unlocking the door when returning home, going out in the cold, turning on the faucet, or washing your hands.</p><p>Many people with urgency incontinence also have to go to the bathroom more frequently than most people during the day <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> night. &quot;Normal&quot; frequency is considered to be eight times per day and once at night, but this depends on how much you drink and may increase if you drink more than 64 ounces of fluid in a day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixed incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with symptoms of both stress and urgency incontinence are said to have mixed incontinence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Overflow incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overflow incontinence occurs when the bladder does not empty completely, causing leakage when the bladder becomes overly full. It may result in symptoms of either stress or urgency incontinence or both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INCONTINENCE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although leaking urine can be difficult to talk about, it is often treatable with weight management for women who are obese, pelvic floor muscle exercises, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medications. Talking about it with your health care provider is the first step in getting help for this problem that is affecting your life.</p><p>Important questions to discuss include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When do you leak? (When you get a sudden urge, with <span class=\"nowrap\">coughing/sneezing,</span> or does it occur without warning?)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When did your leakage begin? Has it worsened or improved over time?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you tried any treatments to reduce leakage?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there any medications that you are taking that might be worsening the problem (diuretic medicine for high blood pressure or high doses of pain medications)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you seen blood in your urine or had fevers with bladder pain or other pelvic symptoms such as bulge or pressure? These symptoms should not be ignored and you should be evaluated by a clinician.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder diary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A <a href=\"http://www.oabcentral.org/resources/AUGS_Voiding_Diary.pdf&amp;token=HAZm5AsptUJR2XBY7R1KV22fIJLCo73JF32qauCIO8e1W3TclQb/ydPPnMz+9SrWQtCpYwvCrA4p3ifGhLTdnuBVlQxtn/xb/XlHhxil1TU=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2727\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">bladder diary</a> is a record of how much urine you make and how frequently you go generally during a 24-hour period. You should write down how much fluid you drink and how much urine you make and record any leakage and the activities that caused leakage. This diary may provide useful information about the cause(s) and potential treatment of your leakage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H558985798\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple tests may be done during an office visit to determine the type of leakage you are experiencing. This may include a cough test, when you are asked to cough while your doctor or nurse watches for urine leakage.</p><p>A urine test (urinalysis and sometimes a urine culture to test for bacteria) is usually done to look for signs of infection or blood in the urine. Blood tests may be ordered to measure the kidney function.</p><p>A test to see how well you empty your bladder when urinating may be done. This can involve inserting a small catheter in the bladder or a simple ultrasound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Urodynamic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a urodynamic test, small catheters are placed inside the bladder and vagina (or rectum) to measure how much urine your bladder can hold, what makes you leak urine, and whether there are problems emptying the bladder. This test can be done in the office and may be recommended if you are planning surgery for urine leakage or if the cause of your leakage is not clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">INCONTINENCE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment options for urinary incontinence are discussed in a separate topic review.
