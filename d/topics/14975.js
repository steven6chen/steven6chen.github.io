Complicated pyelonephritis in general, emphysematous pyelonephritis, malakoplakia, and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis are discussed in detail separately.

As an example, in a retrospective study from China that included 98 patients with renal or perinephric abscesses over a 10-year period, the main causative pathogens were <em>Escherichia coli</em> (51.4 percent), <em>S. aureus</em> (10.0 percent), and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> (8.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Renal abscess occurs more frequently than perinephric abscess. Both start with tissue necrosis (lobar necrosis in renal abscess; perirenal fat necrosis in perinephric abscess). Renal abscess forms a walled-off cavity; perinephric abscess consists of a more diffuse liquefaction located between the renal capsule and Gerota&rsquo;s fascia. Septation of the perinephric abscess is frequent, which makes drainage more difficult than that of renal abscess. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1492726249\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal renal abscesses typically occur in the setting of generalized pyelonephritis, particularly in patients with anatomical abnormalities that predispose to infection. As an example, approximately two-thirds of renal abscesses caused by gram-negative organisms occur in patients with a renal stone or vesicoureteral reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In such cases, the kidney may have suffered previous episodes of infection and be chronically pyelonephritic and scarred. </p><p>More rarely, acute pyelonephritis with lobar nephronia may rapidly develop to kidney tissue necrosis and formation of a walled-off cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. This mostly occurs in diabetics and can be associated with papillary necrosis. Following antibiotic treatment, the initial lesion evolves to a cortical scar.</p><p>In the pre-antibiotic era, a renal abscess (also called a renal carbuncle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]) or multiple miliary renal abscesses were classic complications of staphylococcal bacteremia that typically developed one to eight weeks after the initial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/6,7,11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,11-15</a>]. This presentation of renal abscess is now rare, since staphylococcal infections are, in most cases, treated early in their course. Renal abscess from a hematogenous source can, however, still be seen in certain settings, such as an intravenous drug abuser with staphylococcal endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Hematogenous spread can also occur from an infection originating in the contralateral kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>] or from extrarenal sources. As an example, renal abscesses may occur in patients without overt bacteremia who suffered from a seemingly minor skin lesion, such as staphylococcal pyoderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. </p><p>Renal abscesses arising as a consequence of focal suppuration in the setting of acute pyelonephritis can occur in the cortex, medulla, or both, whereas those due to hematogenous spread are usually located in the cortex of the kidney. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1492726295\"><span class=\"h2\">Perinephric abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perinephric suppuration, like renal abscesses, can also occur through local or hematogenous spread. </p><p>With local spread, perinephric suppuration can develop from the outward diffusion of a renal infection (generally due to gram-negative organisms) to the perirenal fat, ie, the infection progresses eccentrically toward the lumbo-abdominal wall and also toward adjacent visceral structures. Perirenal fat infection may also complicate a renal abscess that ruptures through the capsule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] or a cortical staphylococcal renal abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Rarely, perinephric suppuration may arise from non-renal contiguous infection originating from the liver, the gallbladder, the pancreas, small bowel Crohn&rsquo;s disease, a retrocecal appendix, or vertebral osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Conversely, perirenal fat infection can occur from hematogenous seeding, mostly staphylococcal, and in such cases, the kidney is in most instances normal. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H954770166\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Predisposing factors for renal and perinephric abscesses include diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and urinary tract abnormalities. Anatomical abnormalities that can be complicated by infection include a renal stone, especially large staghorn calculi, vesicoureteral reflux, neurogenic bladder, obstructive tumor, papillary necrosis, benign cyst, and polycystic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/1-4,6-8,11,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,6-8,11,12,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of renal and perinephric abscess are often similar and protean. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35601255\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both renal and perinephric abscesses are characterized by the insidious onset of fever, vague lumbo-abdominal pain, pallor, fatigue, sweats, and general signs and symptoms of deep-seated suppuration such as weight loss. Symptoms typical of a urinary tract infection, such as dysuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinary frequency, are not reported in many patients with renal or perinephric abscesses. </p><p>In a Korean series of 56 patients hospitalized with renal or perinephric abscesses, the most common presenting symptoms were fever and chills (reported in 75 and 63 percent of patients, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other symptoms included abdominal pain, anorexia, and dysuria (46, 38, and 9 percent, respectively). The average duration of symptoms prior to admission was 12 days. </p><p>The presentation of the abscess may be particularly indolent in the elderly and in individuals with autonomic neuropathy (as in the setting of diabetes or chronic alcoholism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/13,15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,17,18</a>]. </p><p>As perinephric abscesses can extend to involve adjacent structures, symptoms related to such involvement (eg, right upper quadrant pain with liver involvement or chest pain with an empyema or subphrenic abscess) may also be present.</p><p>On examination, costovertebral angle tenderness to percussion is common. In the Korean series above, it was the most common physical finding, in 75 percent of the patients. Occasionally, a palpable mass can be appreciated. In the setting of perirenal suppuration, the overlying skin may demonstrate an inflammatory reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35601416\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukocytosis is frequently observed in the setting of renal and perinephric abscess, although it is not a specific finding. In diabetics, acidosis is also a common early finding. Inflammatory markers, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), are virtually always elevated, reflective of a deep seated infection. </p><p>Abnormal findings in the urine depend on the pathogenesis of the abscess and whether the infectious process communicates with the collecting system. In the setting of renal abscesses, urinalysis usually demonstrates abundant pyuria and moderate proteinuria along with bacteriuria. However, not all renal abscesses communicate with the collecting system, particularly in cases of infected cysts, and in such cases, the urinalysis may be unremarkable. Similarly, urine studies are usually normal with a perinephric abscess that develops as a result of hematogenous spread and does not communicate with the collecting system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>For patients who have hematogenous seeding of the kidneys or perinephric fat, blood cultures may grow the causative organism. However, some patients who develop renal abscesses from presumed spread from a distant site may have sterile blood cultures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35601430\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities associated with renal and perinephric abscesses can be visualized on various imaging modalities, although computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging procedure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plain radiography</strong> &mdash; Radiographs occasionally reveal signs suggestive of renal and perinephric abscesses. Such findings on abdominal plain films include scoliosis with the concavity toward the lesion, an abdominal mass, an enlarged kidney with indistinct outlines, a loss of psoas margin, a radio-opaque calculus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F94753\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94753 \">image 1</a>), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a poorly defined renal shadow. Chest radiography may demonstrate a pleural effusion, ipsilateral pneumonia, atelectasis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevated hemidiaphragm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasonography</strong> &mdash; Ultrasound typically demonstrates a thick-walled cavity filled with fluid in the setting of renal abscess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63479\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63479 \">image 2</a>). Pus may be difficult to distinguish from sterile urine or blood, and echoes due to renal tissue debris can be difficult to distinguish from necrosis within a necrotic renal cancer. Ultrasonography is strongly suggestive of suppuration when it shows a horizontal separation between an upper level of low-density fluid (urine) and an underlying level of more dense fluid (pus). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Computed tomography (CT) </strong>&mdash; CT with contrast enhancement is the best imaging procedure for identification of renal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60754\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60754 \">image 3</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perinephric abscesses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75530\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75530 \">image 4</a>) and evaluation for extension of perinephric suppuration to adjacent structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51469\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51469 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F94753\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94753 \">image 1</a>), such as the liver, diaphragm, and mediastinum. Films taken one or two hours following injection of contrast may typically show an enhanced rim around the abscess cavity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On CT, renal abscesses appear as intrarenal walled-off cavities. CT may also demonstrate thickening of Gerota's fascia, renal enlargement, parenchymatous inflammation, decreased renal attenuation, and lobar necrosis. Focal or perirenal fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gas may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. Perinephric abscesses are usually confined to the perinephric space by Gerota's fascia but may extend to the retroperitoneal structures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rupture into the collecting system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/6,7,13,15,17-19,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,13,15,17-19,25</a>]. An abscess in the perinephric space may also penetrate into the flank muscles or into the psoas muscle; it may extend caudally between the diverging layers of Gerota's fascia and present as an abscess in the groin or paravesical area. Less commonly, there may be extension into the peritoneal cavity. Cephalad extension may lead to formation of a subphrenic abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], penetration of the diaphragm and empyema formation, progression to the mediastinum, lung abscess, or nephrobronchial fistula. Rupture into the colon occurs infrequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nuclear imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; Nuclear imaging and MRI have limited utility. However, in an Italian series that included 170 adults with acute pyelonephritis with consistent CT findings, of the 26 who were also evaluated with nuclear imaging, 21 also had positive findings on nuclear imaging, and in one case, nuclear imaging showed an abscess which had not been documented by CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This might indicate that in some rare cases, nuclear imaging may have an advantage over CT for diagnosing a renal abscess. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical diagnosis of renal or perinephric abscess should be suspected in a patient presenting with consistent signs and symptoms, including prolonged fever and flank pain as well as laboratory evidence of chronic inflammation (eg, elevated ESR and CRP) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above). In addition, the possibility of a renal or perinephric abscess should be suspected in patients being treated for pyelonephritis who do not or are slow to respond to antimicrobial therapy. Identification of a renal or perinephric abscess on imaging (ideally computed tomography) confirms the diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis of renal or perinephric abscesses is often delayed, sometimes by weeks, until imaging is finally performed, which highlights the importance of a high level of clinical suspicion for these entities. </p><p>A microbiological diagnosis may require cultures of urine, blood, or the abscess itself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H954769657\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiography should be used for definitive diagnosis of renal or perinephric abscess; the most useful modalities are ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/20-24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24,27,28</a>]. While ultrasound can be used to make the diagnosis, CT with contrast medium enhancement is the best imaging procedure for evaluation of renal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perinephric abscesses and for diagnosing a possible extension of perinephric suppuration to adjacent structures, such as liver, diaphragm, and mediastinum. Findings consistent with renal or perinephric abscesses are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H35601430\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H954769848\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiological diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood and urine cultures should be collected at the time of presentation in order to identify a causative pathogen. However, in some cases, particularly with perinephric abscesses, the abscess does not communicate with the collecting system, and culture of a sample of the abscess itself may be required for a microbiological diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1588293396\" class=\"local\">'Perinephric abscess'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine blood work (eg, chemistry panel and complete blood count) is helpful to assess underlying kidney function or the presence of leukocytosis. Urinalysis should also be performed to assess for the presence of pyuria and proteinuria; however, a normal urinalysis does not refute the diagnosis of renal or perinephric abscess, as they might not necessarily communicate with the collecting system. </p><p>Inflammatory markers, such as the ESR and CRP, are not only helpful in supporting the clinical diagnosis but are also useful markers to follow to assess for appropriate clinical response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H31686975\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other entities may present with similar clinical findings as renal or perinephric abscess. These include acute lobar nephronia without renal tissue necrosis, acute pyelonephritis complicated by papillary necrosis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, malakoplakia, and renal cell carcinoma. Most of these can be distinguished from renal or perinephric abscesses on computed tomography (CT) imaging, although in occasional cases, sampling of the tissue or abscess for histology and culture is necessary to make the alternate diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute lobar nephronia (also known as acute focal bacterial nephritis or acute focal pyelonephritis) is an acute, nonsuppurative renal infection that represents a radiological variant of acute pyelonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/10,20,23,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20,23,28</a>]. There is disagreement in the literature (among radiologists, pathologists, and clinicians) regarding the nomenclature used to describe acute lobar nephronia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Although the term was initially used to denote a localized process observed on CT in patients with acute bacterial kidney infection (the term was coined by analogy to &quot;acute lobar pneumonia&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]), there is no doubt that &quot;acute lobar nephronia&quot; is not a distinct entity but simply part of the continuum of bacterial renal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Ultrasonography usually demonstrates a focal mass of hyper-, iso-, or hypoechogenicity compared with the renal parenchymal tissue, and CT typically demonstrates a wedge-shaped or round poorly defined area of decreased density (rather than a well-defined walled-off cavity as seen with intrarenal abscess). Decreased density is the result of intense vasoconstriction in the pyelonephritic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/10,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,28</a>]. These findings are in contrast to the well-defined walled-off cavity that characterizes a renal abscess. Management of acute lobar nephronia consists of antibiotic therapy (usually 2 to 3 weeks). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Papillary necrosis can also complicate acute pyelonephritis, in which the infection progresses to necrosis of the renal pyramids. This can be detected on contrast enhanced CT, on which the entire papillary tip disappears and the calyceal fornix appears eroded and club-shaped.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a gas-producing necrotizing infection that involves the renal parenchyma and, in some cases, the perirenal tissues. CT demonstrates gas in the tissues as opposed to a predominantly suppurative process with renal and perinephric abscesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emphysematous urinary tract infections&quot;, section on 'Emphysematous pyelonephritis and pyelitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malakoplakia is a rare granulomatous inflammatory disease associated with <em>E. coli</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It usually affects the bladder; the kidney is the primary site of involvement in about 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. The classic appearance on CT is an enlarged kidney with multiple hypovascular masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Although generally distinctive from imaging findings of a renal abscess, the diagnosis is definitively made based on histological findings including PAS-positive Michaelis-Gutmann (MG) bodies, which are thought to result from inadequate intracellular killing of phagocytosed bacteria. Therapy should consist of antimicrobial therapy tailored to culture and sensitivity data.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an unusual variant of chronic pyelonephritis in which there is typically massive destruction of the kidney due to granulomatous tissue containing lipid-laden macrophages. Although presenting symptoms may be similar to renal and perinephric abscesses, the imaging findings are quite distinct. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=xanthogranulomatous-pyelonephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, renal cell carcinoma may be difficult to distinguish radiographically from a renal abscess, in which cases a tissue diagnosis may be necessary. Additionally, abscess formation can complicate renal cell carcinoma if it results in obstruction. This entity is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and staging of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to management of renal and perinephric abscess includes antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with percutaneous drainage (when warranted) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. In addition, urologic obstruction, if present, should be relieved promptly. In cases in which the abscess cannot be successfully treated with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage or when the underlying kidney is chronically diseased, surgical intervention may be indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31686901\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H954769250\"><span class=\"h3\">Empiric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of empiric antibiotic therapy depends on the suspected pathogenesis of the abscess. In the setting of an abscess associated with pyelonephritis, empiric therapy should be targeted against Enterobacteriaceae. In contrast, for an abscess associated with staphylococcal bacteremia, therapy should be targeted against this pathogen. In the case of a perinephric abscess when the causative organism has not been clearly established, empiric therapy may be delayed for drainage if it can be done promptly and the patient is stable, because a sample of the abscess itself may be the only microbiologically informative specimen. (See <a href=\"#H954769848\" class=\"local\">'Microbiological diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p>Initial empiric antibiotic therapy is generally administered parenterally. Some antibiotic options are outlined in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74492\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74492 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H954769256\"><span class=\"h3\">Directed therapy and duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial empiric antibiotic regimen should be tailored to culture and susceptibility results once these are available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74492\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74492 \">table 1</a>). Following catheter removal, the antibiotic course for Enterobacteriaceae can be completed with oral therapy guided by culture results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58686\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58686 \">table 2</a>). However, treatment of <em>S. aureus</em> metastatic infection should be completed with parenteral therapy.</p><p>We generally continue antibiotic therapy throughout and after drainage for a total duration of at least two to three weeks. The final duration of antibiotic therapy should be determined by the extent of infection, the patient's clinical response to initial management, and normalization of inflammatory markers. As an example, patients with abscesses that are difficult to drain or slow to resolve on follow-up imaging may require longer courses of antibiotic therapy, tailored to resolution of clinical symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to drainage differs somewhat between renal and perinephric abscesses. Indications for renal abscess drainage depend on the size of the abscess, whereas drainage is generally indicated for perinephric abscesses of all sizes for diagnostic purposes. Percutaneous drainage is generally preferred if possible because of decreased morbidity compared with surgical drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. </p><p>Urologic intervention may be warranted for abscesses that occur in the context of anatomic abnormalities or are too large for effective treatment with antibiotics and catheter drainage. (See <a href=\"#H31687390\" class=\"local\">'Urologic/surgical intervention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The size of the renal abscess generally dictates the need for drainage, which is ideally performed percutaneously (CT or ultrasound guided). </p><p>For renal abscesses &lt;5 cm in diameter, antimicrobial therapy alone (without drainage) is appropriate initial management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. These lesions frequently respond well to prolonged antibiotic treatment, and radiographic localization for drainage can be difficult. If clinical symptoms and radiographic findings persist after several days of antimicrobial therapy, percutaneous drainage of abscesses &lt;5 cm should be considered, if technically possible. </p><p>Patients with renal abscesses &gt;5 cm should be managed with percutaneous drainage in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/2,4,7,12,13,35,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,7,12,13,35,38,39</a>]. </p><p>Drainage catheters should remain in place until discharge is minimal (usually up to seven days). </p><p>The success of this approach was illustrated in a retrospective review of 52 patients with renal abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Resolution with antimicrobial therapy alone was observed in most patients with renal abscesses &lt;3 cm and 3 to 5 cm (100 and 92 percent, respectively). Those with abscesses &gt;5 cm did equally well with percutaneous or open surgical drainage. Similarly, in a series from Korea of 63 patients initially diagnosed with&nbsp;renal&nbsp;or perirenal&nbsp;abscesses, 51&nbsp;abscesses&nbsp;measured&nbsp;5&nbsp;cm&nbsp;or&nbsp;less (mean size 3.6 cm), and 49 of those were treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. All 49 patients showed complete clinical regression and resolution of the&nbsp;renal&nbsp;lesions shown by CT between 3 and 14 weeks. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1588293396\"><span class=\"h3\">Perinephric abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous drainage (CT or ultrasound-guided) is generally indicated for perinephric abscesses for diagnostic purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. As above, since perinephric abscesses do not always communicate with the collecting system, a sample of the abscess itself may be the only microbiologically informative specimen. If prompt drainage is feasible, it should ideally be performed prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy, unless a causative organism has been clearly established, so that the Gram stain and culture results can be used to guide selection of therapy. If drainage cannot be performed promptly, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated as outlined elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H31686901\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p>If cultures of other specimens are informative and drainage is not necessary for a microbial diagnosis, antibiotic treatment without drainage can be successful for small abscesses (eg, &lt;3 cm), as suggested by several observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/14,35,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,35,40</a>]. Drainage is generally necessary for resolution of larger perinephric abscesses or when medical therapy alone is not sufficient. Typically, a higher proportion of perinephric and mixed abscesses warrants drainage compared with renal abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>In some cases, septation of the necrotic and liquescent perirenal fat may complicate adequate drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and make surgical intervention the best approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31687390\"><span class=\"h2\">Urologic/surgical intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consultation with a urologic specialist should be pursued when there is a urologic obstruction that needs relief, when an abscess occurs in the context of an anatomic abnormality (such as large, obstructing renal stones or vesicoureteral reflux), or when the abscess is too large for effective treatment with antibiotics and catheter drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/1,7,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,12,16</a>]. For abscesses that are not amenable to percutaneous drainage, surgical drainage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rescue nephrectomy may be required if medical treatment has failed. </p><p>Nephrectomy may also be warranted for a renal abscess that has developed in a small, scarred chronically pyelonephritic and poorly functioning kidney destroyed by previous episodes of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Perinephric abscesses may also develop in the setting of a chronically infected and atrophic kidney, as in the case of a staghorn calculus, and nephrectomy may be warranted in such cases.

In a series from Korea of 63 patients with renal or perinephric abscesses, the average hospital stay was 15.3 days (range,&nbsp;5 to 31 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Significant predictors of a longer hospital stay were age, diabetes mellitus, and abscess size. Old age, lethargy, and renal insufficiency have also been associated with poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-and-perinephric-abscess/abstract/7,13,15,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,15,17-19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2608224704\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Both processes start with tissue necrosis. Renal abscess is a walled-off cavity, whereas perinephric abscess consists of a more diffuse liquefaction located between the renal capsule and Gerota&rsquo;s fascia. (See <a href=\"#H618772581\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of renal and perinephric abscess are similar and often initially do not evoke a specific diagnosis: fever, flank pain, and laboratory evidence of chronic inflammation. Although dysuria, pyuria, and proteinuria may be present, urinary symptoms and urinalysis abnormalities are not uniformly reported. The presentation may be especially subtle and insidious in the elderly and in individuals with autonomic neuropathy (usually in the setting of diabetes or chronic alcoholism). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities associated with renal and perinephric abscesses can be visualized on various imaging modalities, including plain radiographs, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT). On CT, renal abscesses appear as intrarenal walled-off cavities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60754\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60754 \">image 3</a>). Perinephric abscesses are usually confined to the perinephric space by Gerota's fascia but may extend to the retroperitoneal structures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rupture into the collecting system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75530\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75530 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51469\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51469 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F94753\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94753 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H35601430\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high level of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of renal or perinephric abscess which should be considered in a patient presenting with such symptoms and signs or in patients with pyelonephritis who are slow to respond to therapy. Identification of a renal or perinephric abscess on ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) confirms the diagnosis. CT with contrast enhancement is the best imaging procedure for identification of renal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perinephric abscesses and evaluation for extension of perinephric suppuration to adjacent structures. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood and urine cultures should be collected at presentation in order to identify a causative pathogen. In some cases, particularly with perinephric abscesses, a sample of the abscess itself may be required for microbiologic diagnosis, in which case drainage is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H954769848\" class=\"local\">'Microbiological diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric antibiotic choice depends on the pathogenesis of the abscess. For an abscess associated with pyelonephritis, empiric therapy should be targeted against Enterobacteriaceae; for an abscess associated with staphylococcal bacteremia, therapy should be targeted against staphylococci. Initial empiric antibiotic therapy is generally administered parenterally and should be tailored to culture and susceptibility results once available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74492\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74492 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H31686901\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for renal abscess drainage for therapeutic purposes depend on the size of the abscess, whereas drainage is often indicated for perinephric abscesses for diagnostic purposes. Percutaneous drainage is generally preferred if possible because of decreased morbidity compared with surgical drainage. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Drainage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For renal abscesses, we suggest immediate drainage for abscesses &ge;5 cm in diameter and deferring drainage pending the outcome of initial antibiotic therapy for smaller abscesses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Similarly, for perinephric abscesses when drainage is not necessary for a microbial diagnosis, we suggest immediate drainage for abscesses &ge;3 cm in diameter and deferring drainage pending the outcome of initial antibiotic for smaller abscesses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If clinical symptoms and radiographic findings persist after several days of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, percutaneous drainage of such smaller abscesses may be warranted. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Drainage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic therapy is often continued for at least two to three weeks, although duration should be tailored to individual patient circumstances depending on timing of clinical and laboratory improvement and abscess resolution. Following removal of the drainage catheter, the antibiotic course for Enterobacteriaceae can be completed with oral therapy guided by culture results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58686\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58686 \">table 2</a>). However, treatment of <em>S. aureus</em> metastatic infection should generally be completed with parenteral therapy.
