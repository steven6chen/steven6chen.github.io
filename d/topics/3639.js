The definitions of and classification systems for UA and NSTEMI and their use to assess risk will be reviewed here. Issues related to the evaluation, treatment, and risk stratification of patients with non-ST elevation ACS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-acute-management-of-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the acute management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-stratification-after-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk stratification after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both UA and NSTEMI, as well as ST elevation MI, are associated with unstable coronary lesions and plaque rupture.

Unstable angina is considered to be present in patients with ischemic symptoms suggestive of an ACS and no elevation in troponin, with or without ECG changes indicative of ischemia (eg, ST segment depression or transient elevation or new T wave inversion). Since an elevation in troponin may not be detectable for up to 12 hours after presentation, UA and NSTEMI are frequently indistinguishable at initial evaluation. ST segment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T wave changes are often persistent in NSTEMI while, if they occur in UA, they are usually transient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It should be kept in mind that the sensitivity of the biomarker test (usually troponin) used to evaluate patients with ACS determines whether a patient is labeled as having UA or NSTEMI. With the development of increasingly more sensitive troponins, it can be anticipated that the percent of patient with UA will decrease and the percent with NSTEMI will increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The 2012 joint task force of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the World Health Federation (WHF) defined MI (in pathologic terms) as myocardial cell death due to prolonged ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Regardless of type, the risk is greatest with angina that is refractory to or occurs despite maximal medical therapy and with an accelerating tempo of ischemic symptoms in the preceding 48 hours (crescendo angina) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55745\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55745 \">table 1</a>).

Patients with new onset angina occurring only after heavy physical exertion have a prognosis similar to patients with chronic stable angina. In comparison, new angina occurring after minimal exercise or at rest, particularly if prolonged, carries a worse prognosis in the absence of intervention. In the original Braunwald classification of unstable angina, new onset was defined as less than two months in duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rest angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rest angina, particularly if prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated with transient ST segment changes &gt;0.05 mV, identifies patients at increased risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55745\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55745 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Early post-MI angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early post-infarction angina (defined as chest pain occurring within 48 hours after an acute myocardial infarction [MI]) is typically associated with complex lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent intracoronary thrombus and with more severe coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The recurrent chest pain may signify either remaining viable myocardium in the infarct zone or a different area of myocardium at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a report from the GISSI-3 trial, angina occurred at rest in 94 percent of patients; one-third of episodes occurred within 72 hours of the MI and between 6 and 10 AM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Angina occurring soon after an acute MI is associated with high risk in the absence of intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7-9</a>]. This was illustrated in a report from the GUSTO-IIb trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among 3513 patients with a non-ST elevation (non-Q wave) MI (NSTEMI) (using the old definition that did not include serum troponins), 36 percent had recurrent ischemia that was responsive to medical therapy in 79 percent. Patients with recurrent ischemia that was refractory or responsive to medical therapy had a higher rate of reinfarction at 30 days (29 and 12 versus 3 percent in those without recurrent ischemia) and six months. In addition, the occurrence of refractory ischemia was associated with a higher mortality compared to responsive ischemia or no ischemia at 30 days (16 versus 6 and 4.3 percent) and one year. Similar findings were noted among 4125 patients with an STEMI and in over 40,000 patients with an STEMI in GUSTO-I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>GUSTO IIb also included 4488 patients with UA; 34 percent had recurrent ischemia that was responsive to medical therapy in 82 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients with recurrent ischemia that was refractory or responsive to medical therapy had a higher rate of reinfarction at 30 days (22 and 7.2 versus 2.3 for in without recurrent ischemia) and six months. In addition, the occurrence of refractory ischemia was associated with a higher 30 day mortality compared to responsive ischemia or no ischemia (8.2 versus 2.9 and 1.6 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Postrevascularization angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angina after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) can reflect a procedural event or, over the long-term, restenosis after PCI (less with stenting compared to angioplasty alone, particularly with drug-eluting stents), stenosis in a graft (usually with saphenous vein grafts), or progression of native disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug-eluting intracoronary stents: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-prevention-and-management-of-vein-graft-stenosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Prevention and management of vein graft stenosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Periprocedural</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemic chest pain within 48 hours after stenting usually results from procedural events such as abrupt vessel closure (usually due to stent thrombosis or progression of an untreated dissection), transient coronary spasm, side branch occlusion, or distal embolization of atherosclerotic or thrombotic debris. Some patients have asymptomatic enzyme elevations indicative of small infarctions. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'After PCI'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the EPISTENT trial, the incidence of ischemic chest pain was 11 percent, 12 percent of whom had associated ECG changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When ECG changes were present, there was a significantly increased risk (42 percent) of a cardiac event (death, all MI, repeat revascularization) compared to an intermediate risk of a cardiac event (13 percent) when chest pain without ECG changes was present, and the low risk (5 percent) in the absence of chest pain.</p><p>An important diagnostic consideration soon after PCI is the distinction between ischemic and nonischemic chest pain. Nonischemic chest pain is typically manifested at rest, without ECG changes or elevation of cardiac enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Most patients describe pain characteristics different from their typical angina (more localized and frequently pleuritic). This discomfort lasts for less than 72 hours in about 80 percent of patients, and less than two weeks in the remainder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Overexpansion of the stent is thought to be responsible in most cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As after PCI, recurrent angina during the postoperative period after CABG is usually due to a technical problem with a graft or with early graft closure. It is therefore an indication for prompt catheterization with revascularization by PCI, if feasible. The diagnosis of recurrent ischemia may be difficult to make after CABG, since cardiac enzyme elevations occur as a result of the surgical procedure and since electrocardiographic changes may reflect postoperative pericardial inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Late</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The delayed onset of angina (30 days or more after PCI) can reflect restenosis after PCI, graft stenosis after CABG, or progression of native disease. Affected patients typically present with the gradual and progressive return of effort angina. Prompt stress testing should be performed, since these patients are at increased risk. Stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging or echocardiography is preferred over exercise ECG testing, since these modalities can document both the site and extent of ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-stress-testing-after-coronary-revascularization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of stress testing after coronary revascularization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While less common, some patients with recurrent ischemia present with UA. Such patients should be evaluated with cardiac catheterization after adequate medical stabilization.</p><p>Unstable angina can also occur in patients with prior CABG; such patients have an increased rate of significant coronary events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This issue was best illustrated in the PURSUIT trial of almost 11,000 patients with a non-ST ACS, 12 percent (1134 patients) of whom had a prior CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients with a prior CABG had a significantly higher mortality at 30 days (5.2 versus 3.4 percent without a prior CABG, adjusted hazards ratio 1.45) and six months (8 versus 6.6 percent, adjusted hazards ratio 1.32). This difference may reflect a greater degree of cardiac disease. </p><p>The older the saphenous vein graft, the higher the likelihood that UA is due to a culprit lesion within the graft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50106\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50106 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Grafts are more likely than native vessels to show total occlusion or thrombus, complications that are more refractory to medical therapy. Among patients who undergo PCI for saphenous vein graft disease, the development of restenosis is manifested by an UA presentation in as many as 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In favor of the last mechanism is the observation in a report from the TIMI IIIA trial that approximately one-third of these patients had abnormally slow angiographic filling (TIMI flow grade 2 or less) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The absence of significant coronary disease has also been described in patients with stable angina. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac syndrome X: Angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the TIMI IIIA trial of 391 patients with rest angina who did or did not receive fibrinolytic therapy, 53 (14 percent) fulfilled this criterion; one-half had no visually detectable coronary stenosis on angiography, and one-half had a noncritical coronary narrowing without findings suggestive of an unstable lesion such as ulceration or thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. When compared to patients with UA and a culprit coronary lesion on angiography, those with relatively normal coronary arteries were more likely to be women and to have no ST segment deviation.</p><p>The characteristics of patients with UA who have mild or no coronary disease was further examined in a study of 5767 patients with a non-ST segment elevation ACS who were enrolled in the PURSUIT trial and who underwent angiography: 6 percent had mild coronary disease (&gt;0 to &le;50 percent stenosis) and 6 percent had no disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Thus, the above discussion of the classification of UA also applies to patients with NSTEMI.

This is due in part to an increased incidence of left main or three vessel disease compared to those without ST segment depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

These patients are treated for an ST elevation MI, but some never develop Q waves. Such patients have a better prognosis than those who develop Q waves because of more frequent reperfusion and a less severe infarction.

Six month infarct-free and patient survival were significantly lower for class C than for classes A and B (89 versus 97 percent and 80 versus 89 percent, respectively).

UA and NSTEMI differ primarily in whether the ischemia is severe enough to cause sufficient myocardial damage to release detectable quantities of a marker of myocardial injury.</p><p>Unstable angina is present in patients with symptoms suggestive of an ACS but no elevation biomarkers. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes indicative of ischemia (eg, ST segment depression or transient elevation or new T wave inversion) may or may not be present. Since an elevation in biomarkers may not be detectable for up to 12 hours after presentation, UA and NSTEMI are frequently indistinguishable at initial evaluation. ST segment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T wave changes are often persistent in NSTEMI while, if they occur in UA, they are usually transient. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classification of unstable angina'</a> above.)</p><p>Unstable angina is further categorized based upon patient characteristics at the time of presentation. New onset, rest, early post-MI, and post revascularization angina are examples. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classification of unstable angina'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients in whom NSTEMI is ultimately diagnosed by an elevation of biomarker, a detailed classification scheme (which also applies to STEMI) was developed by the 2012 joint task force of the European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association and the World Health Federation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with NSTEMI, the ECG on presentation may show no gross abnormalities, ST elevation or depression, or T wave inversion. Q waves on the ECG may or may not develop in those with no abnormalities, ST depression, or T wave inversion. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Classification of NSTEMI'</a> above.)</p><p>The different types of non-ST elevation ACS are associated with different risks of adverse outcomes. However, these efforts have limited applicability to current practice since almost all high or intermediate risk patients and many low risk patients now undergo coronary revascularization.
