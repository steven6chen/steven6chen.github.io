Typically, hoods and face masks are not initially used to deliver oxygen in the neonate. These devices should provide warmed and humidified gas that is delivered using a system in which the concentration can be regulated. The inspired oxygen concentration should be monitored with an oxygen analyzer, frequently or continuously if possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H817690173\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal cannula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nasal cannula provides oxygen through two soft prongs that are inserted into the patient's anterior nares (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113273\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113273 \">picture 1</a>). Both low- and high-flow oxygen delivery may be delivered by nasal cannula. Oxygen flows from the cannula into the patient's nasopharynx and mixes with room air entering from the infant's mouth and nose. Consequently, the concentration of oxygen that can be delivered by these methods varies depending upon factors such as the patient's respiratory rate, tidal volume, oxygen flow rate, and extent of mouth breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Low flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One hundred percent oxygen or oxygen administered from an oxygen flow meter is most commonly used for a low flow nasal cannula (flow rates &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min)</span>. However, as noted above, the effective inspired oxygen concentration is a mixture of room air and oxygen delivered by the nasal cannula. As a result, the inspired oxygen concentration cannot be directly determined. </p><p>Another approach for low flow delivery is to employ a blender to administer a selected oxygen concentration (commonly 25 to 40 percent) at a higher rate of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> in infants. The effective oxygen concentration the infant receives will be lower than the setting that is observed on the <span class=\"nowrap\">air/oxygen</span> blender. In preterm infants this approach provides the benefit of providing a modest continuous positive pressure, which is not feasible at lower flow rates when 100 percent oxygen source gas is used. This provides a transition from a standard continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system to low-flow nasal cannula. As the need for CPAP diminishes, transition to low flow rates of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> is recommended, as it is often better tolerated.</p><p>Although there are established formulas to estimate the effective delivered oxygen concentration based upon the size of the patient and the concentration of oxygen and flow rates delivered through the nasal cannula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], these formulas are not routinely used in practice because they are cumbersome to perform during clinical care. As a result, the effective inspired oxygen concentration delivered by low-flow cannula is usually lower than prescribed and, in some cases, almost equivalent to room air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Limited humidification or non-heated nasal cannulae at low flows results in drying of the upper airway mucosa, which can contribute to nasal mucosal injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H311067866\"><span class=\"h3\">High flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) delivery devices incorporate initial flow rates of 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> up to maximum of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> for neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. They are increasingly being used in NICUs in place of nCPAP devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, in our center, HHHFNC is not used as a primary form of respiratory support, but instead as an adjunct form, as the available evidence shows HHHFNC does not provide advantages over CPAP for primary respiratory support.</p><p>The theoretical benefit for HHHFNC is based on the belief that the use of a higher flow rate washes out nasopharyngeal dead space and replaces the end expiratory gas within the upper airway with fresh gas that is oxygenated, humidified, and heated and provides positive airway distending pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Clinical changes observed during effective HHHFNC therapy include a decrease in respiratory rate and observed work of breathing (retractions and nasal flaring).</p><p>However, limited data do not show additional benefit of HHHFNC over the use of nCPAP for respiratory support.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large multicenter noninferiority trial of preterm infants (gestational age &gt;28 weeks) reported a higher rate of treatment failure for patients who were randomly assigned to HHHFNC compared with those assigned to nCPAP for primary respiratory support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This trial was terminated early (564 patients recruited for a predetermined sample size of 750) when an interim predesignated analysis at 500 patient enrollment demonstrated a higher treatment failure rate for the HHHFNC group compared with the nCPAP group (25.5 versus 13.3 percent; risk difference [RD] 12.3 percent, 95% CI 5.8-18.7). Treatment failure was defined as an infant receiving maximal support for either HHHFNC or nCPAP and with one or more of the following criteria: intubation and mechanical ventilation, receiving fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) &ge;0.4, venous or arterial blood gas sample with a pH &le;7.2 or partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) &gt;60 mmHg, and apnea episodes requiring positive pressure ventilation. The rate of intubation did not differ (15.5 and 11.5 percent; RD 3.9 percent, 95% CI -1.7 to 9.6) nor did the rate of adverse events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous systematic reviews had reported that HHHFNC had similar efficacy to nCPAP with no differences in the rate of respiratory failure (need for intubation and mechanical ventilation) as either primary respiratory support or after extubation, mortality, or rate of pulmonary leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Meta-analyses showed that equivalent efficacy was observed primarily in moderate to late preterm infants in the clinical setting of respiratory support following extubation. In addition, HHHFNC was associated with a decrease in nasal trauma. However, several of the included studies were deemed to be of low quality due to the high risk of bias (nonblinded), and therefore, these results must be viewed with caution. Further high-quality clinical trials, similar to the large multicenter trial for primary respiratory support for preterm infants, are needed to evaluate the role of HHHFNC postextubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3336246404\"><span class=\"h4\">Prongs and devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HHHFNC prongs are usually smaller in length and diameter than those used for nCPAP and do not require a seal to operate. HHHFNC prongs should not occlude the nares and instead occupy no more than 50 percent of the internal diameter of the nares to permit sufficient leak and protection from high pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, HHHFNC may be associated with less nasal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and is easier to apply than nCPAP. However, unlike CPAP, the amount of positive pressure generated by HHHFNC varies.</p><p>Each HHHFNC system requires a specific humidification device and cannula that are not interchangeable between systems. Adequate heating and humidification is necessary for each HHHFNC system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Temperature, flow, and FiO<sub>2</sub> are managed by the clinician. The path of gas flow through the system begins with a high-pressure gas source that sends air and oxygen to a blender. The blender down-regulates the gas flow to provide physiologic flow rates that are regulated by the flow meter. High-pressure sensing or an external pressure relief valve is used to detect and divert back pressure caused by any obstruction of flow through the system. Some systems have built-in alarms for detection and notification of high pressure in the system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1591509535\"><span class=\"h3\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are insufficient data, there is a potential risk of traumatic air dissection because HHHFNC can generate high nasopharyngeal pressure, especially if the prongs are too large (which may lead to creation of a seal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. The risk is reduced with maintaining an adequate air leak by ensuring less than 50 percent of the nares are occupied by the prongs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H705751490\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous positive airway pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In neonates who require additional respiratory support, such as preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or apnea, nCPAP is used both as primary respiratory support and as postextubation support. nCPAP is thought to be effective by splinting the pharyngeal airway with positive pressure, thereby maintaining lung recruitment and reducing the risk of upper airway collapse and obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113276\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113276 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary support &ndash; nCPAP is the preferred noninvasive alternative to endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for very preterm infants (gestational age &le;32 weeks) who are at risk for neonatal RDS or apnea of prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. Although there has been a shift from intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation support towards CPAP to reduce lung injury in this susceptible subset of preterm infants, the incidence of BPD has remained relatively constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].<em> </em>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants#H1001477015\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Nasal continuous positive airway pressure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Protective ventilation strategies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-apnea-of-prematurity#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of apnea of prematurity&quot;, section on 'Nasal continuous positive airway pressure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-extubation &ndash; When nCPAP is applied to preterm infants being extubated following mechanical ventilation, it reduces the incidence of adverse clinical events (apnea, respiratory acidosis, and increased oxygen requirements) and the need for reintubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The optimal pressure level for CPAP following extubation is uncertain. Findings from a trial of 93 infants suggest that high versus lower distending pressure (7 to 9 cm versus 4 to 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) was associated with a lower extubation failure rate and reintubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, it remains uncertain whether increasing pressure levels for CPAP would adversely affect cardiovascular function in preterm infants at risk for or with cardiovascular compromise.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3061421370\"><span class=\"h3\">CPAP systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is administered through nasal prongs or mask through a variety of systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113276\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113276 \">picture 2</a>). The type of CPAP system can affect the work of breathing and the amount of pressure needed for adequate oxygenation. In our center, we prefer the fluidic CPAP especially in very preterm infants as it reduces the work of breathing compared with the other two available systems.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constant flow systems use a standard nasal prong or mask interface attached to a standard ventilator circuit. The level of CPAP is controlled by the ventilator settings and the bias flow (the amount of flow left in the circuit during exhalation). Advanced ventilator technology incorporates algorithms that respond to the patient's need or demand for flow. In some cases, if the patient needs higher flow because they are &quot;flow starved,&quot; such as in neonates with respiratory distress; the demand valve of the ventilator opens and allows for higher flows to achieve the desired CPAP. Most ventilators deliver constant pressure to achieve CPAP. However, in low birth weight (BW) infants, minimum or smaller respiratory efforts in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants are sometimes not recognized by the ventilator, making it less responsive to their needs, and thus making this system less favorable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bubble CPAP is a constant-flow variable pressure system that incorporates a standard nasal prong or mask interface attached to a dual-limb heated and humidified circuit. It is the least expensive system, is commonly used in level 2 and 3 neonatal care units, and is easy to initiate in the delivery room. Inspiratory flow is provided from a blended gas source while the expiratory side of the circuit is submersed into a water column. These low flows prevent buildup of back pressure in the system making it a safe application for neonates. The desired level of CPAP in cm H<sub>2</sub>0 is determined by not only the depth of the tubing within the water column but also the amount of flow powering the system. Continuous bubbling requires a base flow rate of 4 to 8 L per minute depending on the type of system used. Bubble CPAP systems' characteristics vary, so careful attention to both the depth and the flow are important factors to consider. CPAP pressure is measured with a pressure manometer to determine the actual pressure delivered. Gas flow is responsible for bubbling in the circuit and produces mini oscillations generated within the chest that can equate to nearly 5 to 20 Hz at average CPAP levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluidic CPAP, also known as variable flow CPAP, uses two individual flow paths, one each for inspiration and expiration. An inlet port supplies fresh gas flow that enters one of the two separate flow paths, converts energy to pressure, and delivers constant pressure through nasal prongs or a mask to the airway. On exhalation, gas exits the system though an exhaust tubing (opposing path) that imposes little to no resistance, making exhalation easy. Because of the availability of the two individual flow paths, transition between inspiratory and expiratory phases occurs quickly and reduces the work of breathing especially in very preterm infants (gestational age &le;32 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3004296360\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our center, we administer CPAP with an initial pressure level of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 and then increase to 6 to 8 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 as needed. We use the fluidic (variable) flow system that allows rapid transition of inspiration to expiration that reduces the work of breathing, especially in smaller infants. In some select cases, infants may benefit from higher pressures up to 10 to 11 cm, which is affected by the amount of leak around the nasal prongs and patient-specific factors, including lung compliance and impaired hypopharyngeal function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1337962454\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NIPPV provides noninvasive respiratory support to preterm infants who otherwise would undergo endotracheal intubation and ventilation. It augments CPAP by superimposing inflations, typically from a ventilator, with a set peak pressure delivered through nasal prongs or mask [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>]. Although NIPPV can be delivered either as synchronized or nonsynchronized breaths, synchronization is difficult to achieve. Availability of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved devices for delivery of synchronized NIPPV in neonates is limited. As a result, NIPPV is generally used in a nonsynchronized mode.</p><p>In nonsynchronized NIPPV, a decrease in extubation failure over CPAP alone has not been clearly documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Because of the challenges of delivering NIPPV and the lack of data demonstrating additional definite benefit of NIPPV, CPAP remains the preferred method for delivery of noninvasive pressure and oxygen in our center. NIPPV is typically used as a bridge before intubation or after extubation when support beyond CPAP is required. (See <a href=\"#H2870948267\" class=\"local\">'Challenges'</a> below.)</p><p>The amount of support (size of the breath) is determined by the difference in the inspiratory and expiratory pressure delivered over a one to two second inspiration for 10 to 30 breaths per minute. Breaths are time cycled and pressure or flow limited. Clinical trials of NIPPV have used a wide range of set peak pressures (10 to 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O pressure), ventilator rates (10 to 60 per minute), and variable inflation times (0.3 to 0.5 seconds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>NIPPV has been used clinically in the following settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/6,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apnea of prematurity.

There was no difference between the two groups in regard to mortality, or the risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). There was also heterogeneity among the studies regarding the device that was used and whether the delivery of NIPPV was synchronized or nonsynchronized.

Delivery of a preset inflation is triggered by a signal from the electrical activity of the diaphragm. NAVA is not affected by leaks around the interface as the inflation is synchronized with the infant's own inspiratory effort and the changes in the respiratory pattern are accurately monitored and regulated by the patient's breathing activity. NIV-NAVA has been used clinically to reduce intubation and mechanical ventilation, and it is unclear based on limited data whether there are short-term clinically beneficial effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

A pass-over system is used to humidify the oxygen to prevent drying of the skin and inspired gas. In preterm neonates &lt;1500 g, the oxygen is heated to the same temperature as the incubator.

In preterm infants, high concentrations of supplemental oxygen are associated with increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).

The PaO<sub>2</sub>, along with the accompanying measurements of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and pH, are used to evaluate effective pulmonary gas exchange in acute cardiopulmonary disease. However, intermittent sampling of arterial blood may not reflect the fluctuations in oxygenation that typically occur in infants with cardiopulmonary disease or in response to percutaneous puncture. In addition, although PaO<sub>2</sub> measurements can be used to estimate oxyhemoglobin saturation, changes in pH, temperature, or other factors may render this estimate unreliable. Capillary samples do <strong>not</strong> provide reliable measurements of PaO<sub>2</sub>.

The brachial and femoral arteries should be avoided if possible. Percutaneous puncture frequently causes agitation, and the resultant PaO<sub>2</sub> measurement may be lower than in steady state conditions.</p><p>Catheterization of the arterial system can be performed when frequent arterial blood gases are required. Sampling from a catheter also avoids the agitation associated with percutaneous puncture. Preferred locations in newborns are the umbilical or radial arteries; an alternate site is the dorsalis pedis. Common clinical settings in which an indwelling arterial catheter is useful include patients with tenuous gas exchange (eg, severe respiratory distress syndrome or persistent pulmonary hypertension) or shock.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Sources of error</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of arterial blood gases (PaO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub>) can be affected by the presence of air bubbles, the use of heparin as an anticoagulant, and the type of syringe used for collection. Air bubbles occupying more than 1 to 2 percent of the blood volume in the syringe may introduce error, leading to an artefactual high arterial PaO<sub>2</sub> and an underestimation of the true arterial PaCO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

This monitoring technique provides data that are continuous and noninvasive, and, therefore, avoids some limitations of intermittent arterial blood sampling. As a result, in most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), pulse oximetry is the accepted standard for routine monitoring, and SpO<sub>2</sub> has been called the &quot;fifth vital sign&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

As an example, pulse oximetry values were highly correlated with measured SaO<sub>2</sub>; however, values of 92&plusmn;3 percent were associated with PaO<sub>2</sub> values of 45 to 100 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. It should also be noted that pulse oximeters provide time-measure values over several heart beats and do not give out instantaneous readings. Longer averaging times provide a more stable assessment with fewer alarms but are less sensitive to brief episodes of changes in oxygen saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, it is challenging to maintain these targets, as SpO<sub>2</sub> values fluctuate in unstable neonates and are often outside the intended targeted range. Additional measures, including increased surveillance and heightened awareness by medical personnel at the bedside, may be helpful to reduce the time periods of either too low or too high oxygen saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

However, interpretation of pulse oximetry readings must account for a variety of technical and clinical factors that may artefactually influence the results. The best defense against these potential sources of error is a high level of training regarding the function of the pulse oximeter.</p><p>Technical sources of error include motion artifact, improper probe placement, and ambient light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Low amplitude arterial pulsations in small preterm infants are particularly difficult for oximeters to detect and differentiate from venous pulsations and other movement artifacts. As a result, examination of the displayed waveform is recommended to validate the oximeter signal. An alternate check is comparison of the pulse rate from the oximeter with the heart rate from the electrocardiograph monitor; the two values should be identical.</p><p>Variation in the design of the monitor may result in differences of 2 to 3 percent among various instruments. In particular, different algorithms are used to derive SpO<sub>2</sub>, correct for minor hemoglobin variants, or to exclude motion artifact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, algorithms vary on the averaging time for waveform analysis, which may affect the rate and detection of desaturation events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. As a result, short events that are in close proximity may be displayed as a single longer event, which may impact clinical decision making. Therefore, some pulse oximeters may not be suitable for neonatal use.</p><p>Erroneous data will result if the probe is improperly placed on the extremity or if it is exposed to ambient light. These problems can be avoided by proper placement and shielding of the probe.</p><p>Clinical factors that contribute to error include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoperfusion &ndash; Pulse oximetry readings can be falsely low because of signal failure in the setting of hemodynamic instability or poor limb perfusion caused by vasoconstriction.

Although pulse oximetry values are falsely lowered only when anemia is very severe, clinicians must be aware that low hemoglobin concentrations decrease oxygen content and delivery.

These frequent events may produce &quot;alarm overload&quot; among bedside care providers and further contribute to the difficulties of maintaining target saturations in a narrowly defined range. To reduce the impact of these &quot;nuisance alarms,&quot; manufacturers have employed increasingly sophisticated waveform analysis and algorithms that may include longer averaging time. Different averaging times used in conjunction with variable adjustments of alarm delay (which are manufacturer dependent) may influence the duration of desaturation events and the response of care providers.
