This disorder is differentiated from all other forms of HL, which are commonly referred to as classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHLs), by characteristic pathologic and clinical features.</p><p>NLPHL represents a more indolent disease than cHL, and therefore is managed uniquely. Since this disease is rare, most information concerning treatment and outcome has come from reports of single institutions or pooled, multi-institutional retrospective analyses.</p><p>Treatment and prognosis of NLPHL are reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, pathology, and diagnosis of NLPHL are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.) Treatment of the other Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes is discussed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the diagnosis of NLPHL is confirmed, the patient should undergo a work-up and staging evaluation similar to that performed for patients with classical Hodgkin lymphomas. Staging is performed using the Ann Arbor staging system with Cotswolds modifications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66651 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This system is described at length separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, patients with NLPHL have been treated like patients with classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHLs), and many of the large randomized studies that have guided treatment of patients with cHL have included small numbers of patients with NLPHL. NLPHL differs from cHL in terms of natural history, response to treatment, and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and therapeutic approaches may be distinct from cHL. Our approach is generally consistent with that proposed by the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/default.aspx&amp;token=TVbjtb8Z5RUMkRcyA7t0fcOssFPcbpOhPYA7ZB6FNJJY/CUG1w30s5EGgllcurschyz5k1SxL3fc5Ya57NsGqw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4732\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGE IA/IIA DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current treatment strategy for many patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> NLPHL without B symptoms involves local-regional radiation therapy (RT) with 30 to 36 Gy. Doses of 30 Gy are generally considered sufficient in patients whose nodal disease has been completely excised surgically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indolent nature and favorable prognosis of NLPHL are illustrated by published reports of patients who did not undergo further therapy following diagnosis but still enjoyed excellent overall survival. However, these reports must be interpreted cautiously because of a possible inaccurate diagnosis due to the absence of immunophenotyping, the small patient numbers, and likelihood for selection bias. As an example, in a series from 1983 of 51 patients diagnosed with NLPHL, most of whom were stage IA, 31 did not receive any treatment other than tumor excision, with actuarial survival rates at 5 and 10 years of 93 and 80 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Of the 31 untreated patients, only seven had died, with one death due to Hodgkin lymphoma and two to autopsy-confirmed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This report and another similar report indicate that some patients with early stage disease have enjoyed long-term survival with no treatment other than the original lymph node resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical excision alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data in adults concerning the efficacy of surgical excision alone. By comparison, several pediatric study groups have reported small nonrandomized series in which children and adolescents received only careful follow-up after initial lymph node resection in an attempt to avoid toxicities that can be associated with treatment (eg, growth retardation, infertility, hypothyroidism, cardiopulmonary complications, secondary malignancy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. However, the current use of limited fields and lower doses of radiation make the potential adverse long-term effects of treatment less concerning. Observation without treatment following excision is still considered experimental and should be reserved for highly selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of RT alone for early stage NLPHL has been evaluated retrospectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. The following is an overview of some of the studies that have evaluated this treatment approach.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study from the Australasian Radiation Oncology Lymphoma Group described the outcomes of 202 patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (LPHL) treated with RT alone (median dose of 36 Gy) at nine centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Pathology specimens were only available on 120 patients and were not centrally reviewed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At a median follow-up of 15 years, the 10- and 15-year overall survival (OS) rates were 88 and 83 percent, respectively. Freedom from disease progression at 10 and 15 years were 88 and 82 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>On multivariate analysis, the number of sites of involvement was found to be an independent prognostic factor for disease progression. Those patients with one or two sites of involvement were at a significantly lower risk of progression following RT than those with three or more sites of involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another retrospective study of 42 patients with NLPHL included 22 patients with stage IA disease who were treated with involved-field RT (35 Gy) alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Among these patients, 25 received limited-field RT, 35 received regional field, and 46 received extended field RT. Among those treated with RT alone, the rates of progression-free survival (PFS) at 10 years were 89 and 72 percent for those with stage I or II disease, respectively. Corresponding 10-year survival rates were 96 and 100 percent, respectively. PFS and OS rates were similar among the three RT groups. Patients treated with chemotherapy alone had a higher rate of progression than those whose treatment included RT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of stage IA NLPHL from the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG), estimated rates of PFS and OS at eight years were similar among patients treated with extended-field RT (49 patients; PFS 84 percent and OS 96 percent) or involved-field RT (108 patients; PFS 92 percent and OS 99 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p>These data tend to support the notion, as discussed below, that patients with early stage NLPHL may be adequately treated with less than full mantle fields without compromising disease control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduced volume RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduced volume RT is becoming better accepted as the treatment of choice in patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> NLPHL. A combined subset analysis of three selected retrospective studies gives insight into the outcome following RT alone in a total of 131 patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> NLPHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The combined recurrence rate following more limited mantle or regional RT was 19 percent (14 of 73 patients), which was similar to a recurrence rate of 16 percent (9 of 58 patients) following the use of more extensive subtotal- or total-lymphoid RT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">RT technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, involved-node (IN) or involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT) utilizing doses of 30 to 36 Gy is considered appropriate therapy for patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> NLPHL. Guidelines for <span class=\"nowrap\">IN/ISRT</span> are well described elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Generally, computed tomography (CT)-based simulation with three-dimensional (3-D) conformal treatment planning is used to determine target volumes and organs-at-risk. If positron emission tomography (PET)-CT was used as part of staging, fusion of the PET study with the CT-simulation study, along with intravenous contrast, can further help improve target delineation. </p><p>Because radiotherapy is the sole modality in most cases of early stage NLPHL, the clinical target volume definition should be generous, with inclusion of any sites that are suspicious of harboring microscopic disease. The expansion from clinical target volume to internal target volume to planning target volume depends on the site(s) of involvement, immobilization technique, and patient cooperation, and generally range from 5 mm to 15 mm. </p><p>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) should be considered if target metrics of surrounding organs-at-risk cannot be met with 3-D conformal therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H1070824621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">RT with or without chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of patients with NLPHL treated with moderate dose RT with or without chemotherapy is favorable.

Representative studies are presented below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the European Task Force on Lymphomas (ETFL) study, patients with stage I NLPHL were treated with either RT alone (88 percent) or RT combined with chemotherapy (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The corresponding figures for patients with stage II disease were 57 percent and 38 percent, respectively. The eight-year overall survival and freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) were 99 percent and 85 percent for patients with stage I disease and 94 percent and 71 percent for patients with stage II disease, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective report from the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) analyzed the treatment outcome of 256 patients with stage IA NLPHL without risk factors (ie, bulky disease, extranodal disease, ESR &gt;50 without B symptoms or ESR &gt;30 with B symptoms, three or more sites) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Estimated eight-year relapse-free survival rates were 84 percent after extended-field (EF) RT (49 patients), 92 percent after involved-field (IF) RT (108 patients), and 89 percent after combined modality treatment (two to four cycles of ABVD followed by <span class=\"nowrap\">EF/IF-RT;</span> 72 patients). In an additional 27 patients treated with four doses of weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> only, the estimated four-year relapse-free survival was 81 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These results suggest that EFRT, IFRT, and combined modality treatment achieve similar tumor control, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> alone is associated with an increased risk of relapse. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study from the MD Anderson Cancer Center compared the outcome in 48 patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> NLPHL who were treated with RT alone (n = 37) or combined modality therapy (n = 11) and found that the addition of chemotherapy did not improve relapse-free or overall survival at a median follow-up of 9.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective randomized trial evaluated the role of RT (30 Gy to extended field plus 10 Gy to involved field) with or without two cycles of ABVD chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> Hodgkin lymphoma without risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nodular-lymphocyte-predominant-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

This preference is primarily based upon our clinical experience, the desire to use rituximab in a CD20 positive tumor, and limited data that suggest that ABVD (doxorubicin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dacarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dacarbazine</a>) is not as effective as other alkylator-based regimens.
