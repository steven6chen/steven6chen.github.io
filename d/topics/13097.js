This process occurs in genetically susceptible subjects, is probably triggered by one or more environmental agents, and usually progresses over many months or years during which the subject is asymptomatic and euglycemic. Thus, genetic markers for type 1A diabetes are present from birth, immune markers are detectable after the onset of the autoimmune process, and metabolic markers can be detected with sensitive tests once enough beta cell damage has occurred, but before the onset of symptomatic hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This long latent period is a reflection of the large number of functioning beta cells that must be lost before hyperglycemia occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66417 \">figure 1</a>). Type 1B diabetes mellitus refers to nonautoimmune islet destruction (Type 1B diabetes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of type 1A diabetes is quite different from that of type 2 diabetes mellitus, in which both decreased insulin release (not on an autoimmune basis) and insulin resistance play an important role. Genome-wide association studies indicate that type 1 and type 2 diabetes' genetic loci do not overlap, although inflammation (eg, interleukin-1 mediated) may play a role in islet beta cell loss in both types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of type 1 diabetes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Associated autoimmune diseases in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymorphisms of multiple genes are reported to influence the risk of type 1A diabetes (including, HLA-DQalpha, HLA-DQbeta, HLA-DR, preproinsulin, the <em>PTPN22 </em>gene, CTLA-4, interferon-induced helicase, IL2 receptor (CD25), a lectin-like gene (KIA0035), ERBB3e, and undefined gene at 12q) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. A meta-analysis of data from genome-wide association studies confirmed the above associations and identified four additional risk loci (BACH2, PRKCQ, CTSH, C1QTNF6) associated with an increased risk of type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In addition, some loci conferring shared risk for celiac disease (RGS1, IL18RAP, CCR5, TAGAP, SH2B3, PTPN2) have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most loci have small effects, and the variants studied are common. The CCR5 association is of interest in that a 32-base pair insertion deletion in a chemokine receptor, CCR5, results in a loss of function and, when homozygous, a twofold decrease in risk of type 1 diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'MHC genes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Non-MHC genes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Association with other autoimmune diseases'</a> below.)</p><p>Genes in both the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and elsewhere in the genome influence risk, but only human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have a large effect, followed by insulin gene polymorphisms and PTPNN22. Although the association of certain HLA alleles with type 1 diabetes is strong, this genetic locus is estimated to account for less than 50 percent of genetic contributions to disease susceptibility. The associations of other loci are of a magnitude that do not contribute to prediction of disease but may implicate important pathways, such as CCR5.</p><p>In particular, it is estimated that 48 percent of the familial aggregation can now be ascribed to known loci, and the MHC contributes 41 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, siblings with the highest risk HLA DR and DQ alleles (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">DR3/DR4</span> heterozygotes), who inherit both HLA regions identical by descent to their diabetic sibling, may have a risk of developing anti-islet autoimmunity as high as 80 percent and a similar long-term risk of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The lifelong risk of type 1 diabetes is markedly increased in close relatives of a patient with type 1 diabetes, averaging approximately 6 percent in offspring, 5 percent in siblings, and 50 percent in identical twins (versus 0.4 percent in subjects with no family history) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,15</a>]. A monozygotic twin of a patient with type 1 diabetes has a higher risk of diabetes than a dizygotic twin, and the risk in a dizygotic twin sibling is similar to that in non-twin siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">MHC genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major susceptibility genes for type 1 diabetes (called IDDM1 for the MHC locus) are in the HLA region on chromosome 6p [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This region contains genes that code for MHC class II molecules expressed on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages. These MHC molecules consist of alpha and beta chains that form a peptide-binding groove in which antigens involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes are bound. MHC binding of antigen allows it to be presented to antigen receptors on T cells, which are the main effector cells of the destructive autoimmune process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63541\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63541 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structure and function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ability of these class II molecules to present antigens is dependent in part upon the amino acid composition of their alpha and beta chains. Substitutions at one or two critical positions can markedly increase or decrease binding of relevant autoantigens and therefore the susceptibility to type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In particular, more than 90 percent of patients with type 1 diabetes carry either HLA-DR3,DQB1*0201 (also referred to as DR3-DQ2) or -DR4,DQB1*0302 (also referred to as DR4-DQ8), versus 40 percent of controls with either haplotype; furthermore, approximately 30 percent of patients have both haplotypes <span class=\"nowrap\">(DR3/4</span> heterozygotes), which confers the greatest susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of this high-risk genotype is remarkably high in some populations. As an example, 8.9 percent of healthy white teenagers in Washington state have the <span class=\"nowrap\">DR4,DQB1*0302/DR3,DQB1*0201</span> genotype and 2.4 percent of the general population of Denver, Colorado. Approximately 5 percent of children with this genotype develop type 1A diabetes versus approximately 0.3 percent of children overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. A subset of DR4 alleles, such as DRB1*0403 and DPB1*0402, decrease the risk of development of diabetes, even with the high risk DQB1*0302 allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>In addition, the HLA allele DQB1*0602 confers protection against the development of type 1 diabetes. This allele is present in approximately 20 percent of the general US population, but only 1 percent of children developing type 1A diabetes. One prospective study evaluated 72 relatives with islet-cell antibodies (ICA), 75 percent of whom carried the high-risk alleles DQB1*0302 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> *0201 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Diabetes developed in 28 of the 64 subjects who did not have the DQB1*0602 allele versus none of the eight with it. No other common DQ allele provides such dramatic protection.</p><p>The prevalence of these genes varies with ethnicity, and explains to a large degree why type 1 diabetes is relatively common in Scandinavia and Sardinia, but uncommon in China (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80483\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80483 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-MHC genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although important, the MHC susceptibility genes are not sufficient to induce type 1 diabetes, suggesting polygenic inheritance in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An important component of the susceptibility to type 1 diabetes resides in certain non-MHC genes that have an effect only in the presence of the appropriate MHC alleles.</p><p>In particular, polymorphisms of a promoter of the insulin gene and an amino acid change of a lymphocyte-specific tyrosine phosphatase (termed lyp, <em>PTPN22</em>) are associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes in multiple populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. A repeat sequence in the 5' region of the insulin gene is associated with greater insulin expression in the thymus and it is hypothesized that this contributes to decreasing the development of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The polymorphism of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) gene influences T cell receptor signaling, and the same polymorphism is a major risk factor for multiple autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>A polymorphism in the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 gene was shown to be associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes in a meta-analysis of 33 studies involving over 5000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence for the role of non-MHC genes comes from studies in NOD mice (nonobese diabetic mice, a major model of type 1A diabetes). These mice develop spontaneous autoimmune diabetes with striking similarities to type 1 diabetes in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Autoimmune infiltration of the islets of Langerhans (insulitis) begins at approximately 50 days of age and clinical diabetes appears at approximately 120 days.</p><p>Interferon gamma-positive T cells (Th1 cells) appear to be an important mediator of the insulitis in NOD mice, and destruction of the islet cells can be slowed by the administration of anti-interferon gamma antibodies. Interferon gamma-inducing factor (IGIF; also called interleukin-18) and interleukin-12 are potent inducers of interferon gamma, and the progression of insulitis begins in parallel with increased release of these two cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>It was initially thought that, in contrast to Th1 cells, Th2 cells (which produce interleukin-4, -5, -10, and -13) protected against the onset and progression of type 1 diabetes. However, Th2 cells also are capable of inducing islet cell destruction and, therefore, the onset and progression of type 1 diabetes are probably under the control of both Th1 and Th2 cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>A more generalizable concept is that type 1A diabetes is prevented by a balance between pathogenic and regulatory T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A major subset of regulatory T lymphocytes termed regulatory T cells (Tregs) express the markers CD4 and CD25 on their surface and lack the IL7 receptor. Tregs generally suppress or downregulate induction and proliferation of effector T cells and are dependent for development upon a transcription factor termed FOXP3. Mutations of FOXP3 lead to lethal neonatal autoimmunity, including type 1 diabetes in neonates. This condition, though extremely rare (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IPEX: Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked&quot;</a>), is important to recognize as bone marrow transplantation can reverse it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-autoimmunity#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of autoimmunity&quot;, section on 'Pathogenetic mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p><em>STAT3</em> mutations have been identified as a monogenic cause of autoimmunity, including type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. De novo<em> </em>germline activating <em>STAT3 </em>mutations are associated with a spectrum of early-onset autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid dysfunction, and autoimmune enteropathy. These findings emphasize the critical role of <em>STAT3</em> in autoimmune disease and contrast with the germline inactivating <em>STAT3 </em>mutations that result in hyperimmunoglobulin E (IgE) syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-dominant-hyperimmunoglobulin-e-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOIMMUNITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) were first detected in serum from patients with autoimmune polyendocrine deficiency; they have subsequently been identified in 85 percent of patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and in prediabetic subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Radioassays are available to detect autoantibodies, which react with specific islet autoantigens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prediction of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with type 1 diabetes who do not have islet cell or other autoantibodies at presentation have a similar degree of metabolic decompensation as do children who have these antibodies, although those with more of the different types of antibodies appear to have the most accelerated islet destruction and a higher requirement for exogenous insulin during the second year of clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A few patients from Japan without obvious evidence of islet autoimmunity have been described in whom the onset of hyperglycemia was abrupt, A1C (glycosylated hemoglobin values) were normal, and serum pancreatic enzyme concentrations were high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. It is not clear whether these patients had an unusually abrupt onset of autoimmune type 1A diabetes or nonautoimmune islet destruction (type 1B diabetes), though with studies indicating high-risk human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles in these individuals, rapid type 1A diabetes in the absence of islet autoantibodies is a possibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Target autoantigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ongoing search has identified several autoantigens within the pancreatic beta cells that may play important roles in the initiation or progression of autoimmune islet injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69086\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69086 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40</a>]. Studies on the NOD (nonobese diabetic) mouse model indicate that <span class=\"nowrap\">proinsulin/insulin</span> itself is the likely primary target for the autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. The autoimmune response to proinsulin subsequently spreads to other autoantigens, such as islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic-subunit-related protein (IGRP), which is downstream of the immune response to insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Diabetes in the NOD mouse can be eliminated by changing a specific amino acid of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Other important autoantigens are glutamic-acid decarboxylase (GAD), insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2 and IA-2 beta), and the autoantigen ZnT8, a zinc transporter of islet beta cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>].

Direct confirmation of this hypothesis has come from studies in NOD mice. Pathogenic CD8+ T cell clone recognizes an epitope on the insulin B chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and a major target autoantigen for CD4 T cells of NOD mice is insulin peptide B chain amino acids 9 to 23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Similar T cell responses are found in peripheral lymphocytes obtained from patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes and from subjects at high risk for the disease have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Also consistent with the importance of insulin as an autoantigen is the demonstration that knockouts of the insulin genes in NOD mice greatly influence progression to disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], and the administration of insulin or its B chain during the prediabetic phase can prevent or delay diabetes in susceptible mice and perhaps in humans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Insulin'</a>.)</p><p>Insulin autoantibodies are often the first to appear in children followed from birth and progressing to diabetes, and are the highest in young children developing diabetes. Of note, once insulin is administered subcutaneously, essentially all individuals develop insulin antibodies, and thus insulin autoantibody measurements after approximately two weeks of insulin injections cannot be used as a marker of immune mediated diabetes (type 1A) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Glutamic acid decarboxylase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another important autoantigen against which antibodies are detected is the enzyme GAD, which is present in the islets as well as in the central nervous system and testes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Antibodies to GAD (a 65-kD protein) are found in approximately 70 percent of patients with type 1 diabetes at the time of diagnosis.</p><p>Autoantibodies reacting with GAD (anti GAD65 antibodies) are prominent in humans with type 1 diabetes.

NOD mice rendered tolerant to GAD develop diabetes. This coupled with lack of GAD expression by mouse islets has cast doubt on its importance as a pathogenic autoantigen in this model, although injections of GAD peptides slow progression to diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Insulinoma-associated protein 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another autoantigen is a neuroendocrine protein called insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2), which is a protein tyrosine phosphatase-related protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. IA-2 is granule membrane protein, whose cytosolic domain binds beta 2-syntrophin, an F-actin-associated protein, and is cleaved upon granule exocytosis. The resulting cleaved cytosolic fragment, ICA512-CCF, reaches the nucleus and upregulates the transcription of granule genes, including insulin and ICA512 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Autoantibodies to IA-2 usually appear later than autoantibodies to insulin and GAD, and are highly associated with expression of multiple anti-islet autoantibodies and progression to diabetes.

This condition is termed &quot;epitope spreading.&quot; Several observations indicate that islet autoantibody responses directed to multiple islet autoantigens are associated with progression to overt disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A number of additional type 1 diabetes-related autoantigens have been identified, which include islet cell autoantigen 69 kDa (ICA69), the islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP), chromogranin A (ChgA), the insulin receptor, heat shock proteins, the antigens jun-B,16, CD38, peripherin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>It has been hypothesized that early autoimmunity in spontaneous type 1 diabetes can also target nervous system tissue elements, raising the concept that in type 1 diabetes pathogenetic immune responses may also be non-beta cell exclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

While the role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and the frequent development of autoantibodies are not in question, there is increasing evidence for a major role of cellular immunity. The occurrence of type 1 diabetes in a 14-year-old boy with X-linked agammaglobulinemia suggests that B cells are not required for the development of the disorder and that the destruction of pancreatic beta cells is mediated principally by T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>The observation that this boy did not develop the disorder until age 14 years might imply that normal B cells facilitate the development of diabetes, but are not absolutely necessary. This is supported by a study of NOD mice, which found that when the mice were rendered absolutely deficient in B cells, the incidence of diabetes in female mice dropped from 80 percent to 30 percent, and the disease developed later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Other groups have reported almost complete protection if autoantibodies are absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Naturally processed epitopes of islet cell autoantigens represent the targets of effector and regulatory T cells in controlling pancreatic beta cell-specific autoimmune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In particular, naturally processed HLA class II allele-specific epitopes recognized by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, corresponding to the intracellular domain of IA-2, were identified after native IA-2 antigen was delivered to EBV-transformed B cells and peptides eluted and analyzed by mass spectrometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Furthermore, dendritic cell subsets can process and present soluble IA-2 to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after short-term culture, but only plasmacytoid dendritic cells enhance (by as much as 100 percent) autoantigen presentation in the presence of IA-2 autoantibody patient serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The plasmacytoid subset of dendritic cells is overrepresented in the blood close to type 1 diabetes onset and shows a distinctive ability to capture islet autoantigenic immune complexes and enhance autoantigen-driven CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. This suggests a synergistic proinflammatory role for plasmacytoid dendritic cells and IA-2 autoantibodies in type 1 diabetes. Taken together, these observations may lead to identification of novel naturally processed epitopes recognized by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which may represent potential therapeutic agents, either in native form or as antagonistic altered peptide ligands, for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular mimicry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initiating factors of the immune response are not well understood. One possibility is molecular mimicry due to homology between GAD and an infectious agent such as Coxsackie B virus (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Role of viruses'</a> below). A study of the expression of a beta cell specific 38 kDa protein in rats provides an alternative model for how this might occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. This protein is expressed in the islets at birth and at all times thereafter in strains that are resistant to the development of diabetes, but is not expressed until day 30 in diabetes-prone biobreeding (BB) rats.

Tolerance to tissue-restricted self-molecules is believed to begin at the level of the thymus with negative selection where the deletion of thymocytes with T cell receptors (TCR) exhibiting strong affinity towards self-molecules are expressed during maturation of the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>]. The insulin gene is one of the most widely studied genes in both humans and mice exhibiting thymic expression as well as a beta cell expression-dependent association with type 1 diabetes susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41,69,74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,69,74-76</a>]. For instance, in humans the IDDM2 susceptibility locus of the insulin gene (INS) is a region associated with type 1 diabetes and has been finely mapped to reveal Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms upstream of the INS promoter. The length of these repeats has been directly implicated in the control of the expression levels of insulin mRNA in the thymus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/76-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-79</a>]. In addition to insulin, islet cell autoantigen 69 kDa (ICA69), a neuroendocrine protein targeted by autoimmune responses in human T1D and in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>], is also expressed in the thymus, and the likelihood that thymic levels of ICA69 will affect susceptibility to T1D through a mechanism similar to that shown for the insulin VNTRs has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/69,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,83</a>]. This hypothesis is primarily based on previous studies indicating that IA-2, GAD, and ICA69 are transcribed in the human thymus throughout fetal life and childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/69,77,84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,77,84,85</a>], and that the existence of DNA sequence variation in NOD mice with the potential for functionally relevant effects on <em>Ica1</em> gene expression in the thymus. Such variations in the <em>Ica1</em> promoter might lead to an increased probability of failure to negatively select ICA69-reactive T cell clones of developing thymocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Reversal of diabetes in animal models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reversal of type 1 diabetes with administration of complete Freund's adjuvant, an immune modulator, has been reported in up to 32 percent of treated diabetic mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>]. This recovery is believed to be due to immunomodulation of an underlying autoimmune condition, allowing proliferation of small numbers of surviving islet cells and restoration of the beta cell mass in the mouse pancreas.

The immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome is associated with neonates developing type 1 diabetes. These infants usually die of overwhelming autoimmunity, in particular, severe enteritis. They have a mutation of a gene termed <em>foxp3</em>, a &quot;master-switch&quot; for the development of regulatory T cells. Studies of the syndrome and the related animal model provide dramatic evidence that regulatory T cells (formerly termed suppressor T cells) have a major physiologic role. The APS-I syndrome (Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome type 1) is caused by a mutation of the <em>AIRE</em> gene (autoimmune regulator). This gene controls expression of a series of &quot;peripheral&quot; antigens in the thymus, including insulin. It is thought that the gene provides protection from autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, via its influence on central T cell tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental influences are another important factor in the development of type 1 diabetes.

Although isolated case reports have suggested direct viral destruction of beta cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>], this is probably extremely rare.

Studies suggest a role for innate immune system activation in this model.

Impaired glucose tolerance frequently precedes the onset of overt diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. The most widely used test to estimate functioning beta cell mass is measurement of the acute insulin response to an intravenous injection of glucose (AIRg). This test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,139</a>] is used, along with immunologic measurements, to identify subjects at high risk for type 1 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prediction-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prediction of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been thought in the past that approximately 90 percent of the beta cell mass needs to be destroyed before hyperglycemia occurs; however, this is probably not true. As an example, the administration of streptozotocin in increasing doses to adolescent baboons can induce complete insulin dependency (with no detectable AIRg) at a time when 30 to 50 percent of the beta cell mass is still viable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. The profound insulin deficiency in this setting is out of proportion to the loss of functioning cells and may be due in part to the inhibitory action of cytokines released from inflammatory cells in the islets. The following observations are consistent with the importance of such external factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When severely inflamed islets are removed from 12- to 13-week-old NOD mice and studied in culture, insulin secretion on day 0 is very low, but there is almost complete recovery of function by day seven (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53657\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53657 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic and in vitro physiologic studies of the pancreas of a patient who died soon after the onset of type 1 diabetes revealed that a substantial mass of beta cells were still viable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a mouse model of diphtheria toxin-induced beta cell apoptosis (characterized by the absence of an inflammatory reaction), cessation of diphtheria toxin expression was associated with beta cell proliferation, recovery of beta cell function, and subsequent normalization of glucose homeostasis, even in a hyperglycemic environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. These findings are in contrast to those observed in autoimmune and pharmacologic (streptozotocin) models of diabetes, in which beta cells have demonstrated a poor ability to regenerate.</p><p/><p>These findings are of potential clinical importance, because they suggest that severe hyperglycemia does not necessarily imply irreversible loss of almost all functioning beta cells. Thus, stopping the autoimmune process, even at this late stage, may allow substantial recovery of beta cell function.</p><p>Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is thought to play a role in islet development and function. In transgenic mice, local expression of IGF-1 in beta cells resulted in regeneration of pancreatic islets and reversal of type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. However, in another study, beta cell-specific deletion of the IGF-1 receptor did not affect beta cell mass, but resulted in hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>].
