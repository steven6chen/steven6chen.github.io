Twenty percent of those were surgical inpatients and, using the ACCP Guidelines for risk stratification, it was estimated that 15 percent, 24 percent, and 17 percent were at moderate, high, or very high risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE, which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism).</p><p>Despite significant advances in the prevention and treatment of VTE, pulmonary embolism remains the most common preventable cause of hospital death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>], responsible for approximately 150,000 to 200,000 deaths per year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

These initiatives have come from the National Quality Forum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], the Surgical Care Improvement Project [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], the Centers for Medicine and Medicinal Services, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and the Office of the Surgeon General of the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similar initiatives have been developed in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], and Europe.</p><p>According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the prevention of VTE is the number one strategy to improve patient safety in hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As an example, as part of the Surgical Care Improvement Project, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) now considers appropriate VTE prophylaxis to be a pay-for-performance quality measure for specific procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50947 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Effective and safe prophylactic measures are now available for most high risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>], and numerous evidence-based guidelines have been published for the prevention of VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>In spite of the availability of these guidelines and the availability of safe and effective prophylactic agents, numerous audits have demonstrated that appropriate thromboprophylaxis is not being offered to large numbers of surgical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-33</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ENDORSE study evaluated VTE risk and prophylaxis in all hospital inpatients &ge;18 years of age admitted to a surgical ward in 358 hospitals from 32 different countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,34</a>]. For the 30,827 surgical patients in this study, 64.4 percent (range between countries: 44 to 80 percent) were judged to be at risk for VTE according to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Guidelines available at that time. However, only 58.5 percent (range between countries: 0.2 to 92 percent) of the at-risk surgical patients received ACCP-recommended VTE prophylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Canadian study of 10,744 patients &ge;65 years of age who had hip or knee replacement therapy, only 19 percent received thromboprophylaxis at the time of hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Of importance, the risk of short-term mortality (ie, death within three months of discharge) was significantly lower among those who received post-discharge thromboprophylaxis (hazard ratio 0.34; 95% CI 0.20-0.57).</p><p/><p>Various strategies to improve the use of thromboprophylaxis have been demonstrated to be effective, including computerized order sets with electronic alerts, or pre-printed orders and quality improvement in the form of clinician education programs, audit, and feedback, but further efforts are required at improving the translation of data from clinical trials into clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/35-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR VTE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are numerous risk factors for the development of VTE in surgical patients, including the type and extent of surgery or trauma, duration of hospital stay, a history of previous VTE or cancer, immobility, recent sepsis, presence of a central venous access device, pregnancy or the postpartum period, and inherited or acquired hypercoagulable states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/43-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-60</a>]. For surgical patients, prophylaxis has been recommended according to assignment of the patient to one of the defined surgical risk groups described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of appropriate prophylaxis, the incidence of <strong>asymptomatic</strong> DVT detected by objective diagnostic screening tests has ranged from 10 to 80 percent in various hospitalized medical and surgical groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. From earlier studies, the incidence of fatal pulmonary embolism in the absence of prophylaxis was estimated to be 0.1 to 0.8 percent in patients undergoing elective general surgery, 2 to 3 percent in patients having elective total hip replacement, and 4 to 7 percent of patients undergoing surgery for a fractured hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>These estimates are likely lower today because of the increasing use of early ambulation and shorter lengths of hospitalization. However, data from audits and registries demonstrate that the incidence of VTE, and in particular fatal pulmonary embolism, remains excessively high, even after hospital discharge.</p><p>As an example, in a prospective cohort study of 947,454 middle aged women in the UK, an estimated 1 in 140 women undergoing inpatient surgery in the UK will be admitted with venous thromboembolism during the 12-week period following surgery, 1 in 815 after outpatient surgery, and only 1 in 6200 women not undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. No information was available on the use or non-use of VTE prophylaxis in this cohort of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical risk groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of postoperative VTE depends upon a number of factors related to the surgical procedure itself (eg, degree of invasiveness, type and duration of anaesthesia, requirement for immobilization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>], as well as a number of patient-related adverse risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/15,24,25,64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24,25,64-66</a>].

Although there have been many attempts to quantitate these risks, no one method has been found to be universally acceptable. Thus, the caveat is that if a patient has additional risk factors, consideration should be given to either increasing the intensity or the duration of the prophylactic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/25,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,38</a>]. </p><p>The most widely tested surgical risk assessment model (the Modified Caprini Risk Assessment Model, Caprini score) has been slightly modified for use in the 2012 ACCP Guidelines and is described in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83739 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/64,68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,68-70</a>].

Their estimated baseline risk of VTE in the absence of prophylaxis is estimated to be less than 0.5 percent. </p><p>A prospective observational cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was used to identify independent predictors of 30-day VTE events requiring treatment following outpatient or same-day surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The 30-day incidence of VTE for the 173,501 subjects in the derivation cohort was 0.15 percent, and was 0.06 and 1.18 percent among those in the lowest and highest risk categories, respectively. Results of this study&nbsp;must be interpreted in context; it was unable to provide details on the use of VTE prophylaxis or common VTE risk factors, such as personal or family history of VTE. Nine independent risk factors were identified, including age 40 to 59 years, age &ge;60 years, current pregnancy, active cancer, increased body mass index, operative time &ge;120 minutes, arthroscopic surgery, saphenofemoral junction surgery, and venous surgery not involving the great saphenous vein. Even the highest risk patients using this outpatient model fit in the &ldquo;low risk&rdquo; surgical group, despite the fact that some of the identified risk factors may place a given patient in the highest Caprini risk group. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Low risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low risk surgical patients have been defined as those undergoing general and abdominal-pelvic surgery with a Caprini score of 1 to 2, or those undergoing plastic and reconstructive surgery with a Caprini score of 3 to 4. Their estimated baseline risk of VTE in the absence of prophylaxis is estimated to be approximately 1.5 percent.</p><p>In most cases, low risk surgical patients are those undergoing minor elective abdominal or thoracic surgery. However, in some settings the risk of VTE remains uncertain, and there have not been good randomized clinical trials demonstrating effectiveness of any particular form of VTE prophylaxis. These include vascular surgery, laparoscopic surgery, knee arthroscopy in the absence of more complicated surgery, elective spine surgery (eg, spinal fusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]), shoulder and elbow surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], isolated lower extremity fractures, Achilles tendon rupture repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], and podiatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Moderate risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moderate risk surgical patients have been defined as those undergoing general and abdominal-pelvic surgery with a Caprini score of 3 to 4, or those undergoing plastic and reconstructive surgery with a Caprini score of 5 to 6. Their estimated baseline risk of VTE in the absence of prophylaxis is estimated to be approximately 3 percent.</p><p>Patients undergoing general gynecologic, urologic, thoracic, ankle fracture, or neurosurgical procedures usually fall into the moderate risk category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/24,25,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,75,76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">High risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High risk surgical patients have been defined as those undergoing general and abdominal-pelvic surgery with a Caprini score of 5 or more, or those undergoing plastic and reconstructive surgery with a Caprini score of 7 to 8. Their estimated baseline risk of VTE in the absence of prophylaxis is estimated to be approximately 6 percent. Examples of patients in the high risk group are those undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, pelvic or hip fracture surgery, colorectal surgery, major trauma, spinal cord injury, or cancer surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/25,77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,77,78</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11971783\"><span class=\"h4\">Orthopedic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors increase the risk of VTE during major orthopedic surgery (eg, arthroplasty or hip fracture surgery), including the supine position on the operating table, the anatomic position of the extremity in a patient undergoing knee arthroplasty, and the use of a thigh tourniquet. As examples, internal injury may result from positioning of the extremity, and compression of the femoral vein may occur due to flexion and adduction of the hip during surgery on this joint.</p><p>The use of prophylactic anticoagulation in those undergoing major orthopedic surgery substantially reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of VTE. One meta-analysis of 47 studies in 44,844 patients who underwent either total or partial knee (TPKA) or total or partial hip (TPHA) arthroplasty and received currently approved VTE prophylaxis found that the rates of symptomatic VTE prior to hospital discharge were approximately 1.1 and 0.53 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Because the endpoint was symptomatic VTE during (but not after) hospitalization, the true rate of relevant VTE events was presumably underestimated.</p><p>Whether those undergoing other less extensive lower limb orthopedic surgery require VTE prophylaxis is less well studied. However, one randomized trial suggested that pharmacologic prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin in this population is not warranted, particularly when no other risk factors for VTE exist. In an open label trial (POT-CAST) of 1519 patients undergoing below knee casting of the lower leg (requiring surgical or conservative management), the rate of symptomatic VTE was similar among those receiving&nbsp;LMW heparin for the full period of immobilization compared to those not receiving anticoagulant prophylaxis (1.4 versus 1.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Similarly, in 1543 patients (POT-KAST) who underwent arthroscopy (three quarters had meniscectomy), eight days of LMW heparin did not reduce the rate of symptomatic VTE compared with those not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation (0.7 versus 0.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. There were no differences in major bleeding events in any of the groups (0.1 percent each) in either study. However, noteworthy is that among those who did develop thrombus, many had risk factors for VTE. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12423403\"><span class=\"h4\">Obese patients and those undergoing bariatric surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The obese surgical patient is considered to be at moderate to high risk for VTE, with an estimated Caprini score of 4 or more for those undergoing bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/68,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,81</a>]. However, the preferred anticoagulant (eg, unfractionated versus LMW heparin) and appropriate prophylactic anticoagulation dosing are both unclear; available studies on this subject have been considered to be of low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/68,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,82,83</a>].</p><p>A more complete discussion of this subject is presented separately.

This should be in the form of a written institution-wide thromboprophylaxis policy endorsed by department heads and medical advisory boards. Strategies should be developed to increase compliance with thromboprophylaxis recommendations, including the use of computerized order sets and prompts, pre-printed orders, and periodic audit, including follow-up with feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Problem overview'</a> above.)</p><p>The article &quot;Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition)&quot; is an extensively referenced guideline for the prevention of VTE, which may be useful in formulating these policies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. Their grading system is identical to that used in UpToDate, and includes both the strength of the recommendation as well as the quality of the available evidence. The concept of values and preferences has also been incorporated into a number of these recommendations.
