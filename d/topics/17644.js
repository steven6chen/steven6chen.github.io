AA amyloidosis can complicate a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and ankylosing spondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-aa-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If untreated, AA amyloidosis is a serious disease with a significant mortality due to end-stage renal disease, infection, heart failure, bowel perforation, or gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Patients with persistently high circulating levels of serum amyloid A protein (SAA) are at particular risk of these complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. A progressive improvement in survival rates has been reported among patients with AA amyloidosis, likely reflecting, in part, improved treatment strategies for associated inflammatory disorders, as well as earlier detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>].</p><p>In a review of 374 cases of AA amyloidosis, for example, mean survival from diagnosis was 133 months, with older age, reduced serum albumin concentration, end-stage renal failure at baseline, and the degree by which the SAA concentration was elevated during follow-up being of poorer prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of control of the underlying disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fibril precursor in AA amyloid, SAA, is a normal plasma protein that is produced by hepatocytes as part of the physiologic acute phase response. A chronic inflammatory state leads to sustained high levels of the acute phase proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Successful treatment of the underlying inflammatory process by, for example, surgical resection of the focus of infection or the tumor, cytotoxic agents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biologic agents in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or antibiotics with chronic infection, results in reduced hepatic production of the acute phase response and a fall in circulating SAA down to normal healthy levels. Over time, this can lead to stabilization of or improvement in renal function, to reduction in urinary protein excretion, and to partial resolution of amyloid deposits (as assessed in studies by scintigraphy with radiolabeled serum amyloid P component [SAP]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. This was illustrated in a report of 80 patients with AA amyloid, mostly due to juvenile idiopathic arthritis or to RA, who were prospectively followed for a median of four years; in this series, the systemic amyloid load was assessed by yearly SAP scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forty-two patients had median serum SAA concentration within the reference range (&lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L);</span> amyloid deposits regressed in 25 and stabilized in 14. Among patients with renal disease at baseline, proteinuria typically fell, while the serum creatinine concentration was either stable or improved. Two patients who required dialysis remained on dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcomes were variable in the other patients. However, among those in whom the serum SAA was persistently above 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> the amyloid load usually increased, and organ function deteriorated. In one patient who underwent renal transplantation, proteinuria and renal amyloid deposits recurred within 36 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was a variable relation between changes in amyloid load and changes in organ function. In some patients, for example, renal function was stable despite a reduction in amyloid load, while others had improved renal function despite a stable amyloid load.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated 10-year survival was much higher in the patients with median serum SAA below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (90 versus 40 percent in those with higher median values), with 60 percent regression as assessed by I-123-labeled SAP scintigraphy, if this level was maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>].</p><p/><p>Similar findings have been noted in other uncontrolled series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/11,12,15-17,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,15-17,19-21</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 10- to 20-year follow-up of 16 adults given alkylating agents because of AA amyloid due to rheumatic disease (RA, ankylosing spondylitis, or juvenile chronic polyarthritis), treated patients had substantial preservation of renal function compared with 48 untreated controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In three patients with Crohn disease who underwent kidney transplantation because of renal amyloidosis, immunosuppressive therapy led to remission of the inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Serial SAP scintigraphy demonstrated regression of amyloid deposits in two patients and stabilization of amyloid in the third.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In four patients with systemic AA amyloidosis complicating Castleman disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia), resection of the tumors may have led to clinical regression of the amyloid, which was also corroborated by SAP scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF AA AMYLOIDOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As illustrated by the preceding observations, the preferred therapy of AA amyloidosis is control of the underlying inflammatory disease and thus near complete suppression of serum amyloid A protein (SAA) production. Treatment needs to be specific for the underlying disease; for example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> is the accepted therapy for AA amyloidosis complicating familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), and agents active against proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, IL-6) have been shown to have efficacy in some cases of AA amyloidosis due to rheumatic disorders and to hereditary autoinflammatory disease. Eprodisate, a glycosaminoglycan mimetic that was developed to interfere with fibril formation in AA amyloidosis, was withdrawn from clinical development after phase 3 studies failed to show benefit. Agents that enhance clearance of amyloid from tissue are undergoing clinical studies. The efficacy of dialysis and renal transplantation in those patients who progress to end-stage renal disease is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Colchicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> has become accepted prophylactic therapy to prevent AA amyloidosis in FMF, where doses of 0.6 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in adults markedly reduced the frequency of attacks of abdominal pain, diminished the incidence of clinical renal disease (including prevention of recurrence in the renal transplant), and stabilized the glomerular filtration rate in patients with mild proteinuria. In the large series reported from Tel Hashomer Hospital in Israel, the rate of development of proteinuria at 9 to 11 years was 1.7 in 960 compliers versus 49 percent in 54 non-compliers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In 86 patients who already had nonnephrotic proteinuria prior to therapy, colchicine led to resolution of proteinuria in five and to stabilization in 68. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of familial Mediterranean fever&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among FMF patients with nephrotic syndrome due to AA amyloid, prevention of disease progression and a reduction in protein excretion can be achieved. However, a higher <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> dose of 1.5 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> appears to be required, and therapy should be instituted before the plasma creatinine concentration reaches 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (132 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Protein excretion in responders can be reduced to below 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> with this regimen; the benefit is gradual, occurring over a one- to two-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A small number of patients do, however, appear to be resistant to the effects of colchicine, possibly reflecting genetic subsets of underlying disease or variable pharmacokinetics of the drug and anti-IL-1 therapies are the second-line treatment of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> is not likely to be effective in salvaging renal function in FMF patients who already have chronic renal failure, since irreversible glomerular injury is probably present. However, it can prevent recurrent disease in the transplant and prevent progressive amyloid deposition in other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The optimal colchicine dose in this setting is 1.5 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day;</span> lower doses are less predictably effective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anecdotal successes with chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> therapy (0.6 mg twice daily) have also been reported in patients with AA amyloid due to inflammatory bowel disease, in patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, and in intravenous drug users with suppurative skin lesions. Proteinuria due to renal amyloidosis may be markedly reduced, and renal function may remain stable over long periods of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/26,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28-30</a>]. However, repeat renal biopsy in one such patient did not demonstrate a reduction in total amyloid deposition despite almost complete resolution of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Dimethylsulfoxide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) may have anti-amyloid activity in several forms of the disorder; it has been shown to be active in murine models of AA amyloidosis and in case reports of patients with AA amyloid due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or to Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Use of DMSO is limited, however, by its acrid odor and, because of its potent solvent activity, by the difficulty attaining purity for pharmaceutical usage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> have been shown to be helpful in AA amyloidosis complicating treatment-responsive inflammatory diseases in individual case reports and small series.

In this study of 15 French patients, of whom six received monthly cyclophosphamide following confirmation of renal involvement, the survival of patients treated with pulse cyclophosphamide was longer than that of those administered non-alkylating drug regimens (mean survival of 165 and 46 months, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Trends toward decreased proteinuria and maintenance of renal function were also noted with cyclophosphamide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results were confirmed in a cohort study reported from Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

This experience has been extended to AA amyloidosis complicating AS and Crohn disease, with regression of tissue amyloid occurring as early as three months, documented by gastrointestinal biopsies in some instances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>Since 2006, with the first report of the effectiveness of a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a>) for the treatment of AA amyloidosis complicating juvenile chronic polyarthritis, there has been a large experience with the use of this biologic agent to improve AA amyloid complicating adult RA, as well as isolated case reports in patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, polyarteritis nodosa, Castleman disease, autoinflammatory disease, and Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. Tocilizumab has been used effectively in patients with RA and renal insufficiency due to AA amyloid, with biological activity manifesting as a dramatic and rapid drop in C-reactive protein (CRP) and SAA levels to normal compared with more traditional treatments, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, with a significantly lower incidence of progression to hemodialysis over time. In a retrospective review of 42 patients with RA and AA amyloidosis treated with tocilizumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] or TNF antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], the former was more efficient in normalizing SAA levels, and was a more effective strategy for treating AA amyloidosis. By contrast, although TNF inhibitors may reduce SAA levels in clinical practice, complete normalization is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Only limited information is available regarding the efficacy of other biologicals, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, which are effective in reducing disease activity but do not have direct anticytokine activity, in reversing the development of AA amyloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>The impact of anticytokine therapy in preventing AA amyloid in hereditary autoinflammatory diseases, such as FMF, TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), or Muckle-Wells disease, is increasingly clear. AA amyloidosis may complicate conditions related to pyrin mutations (in particular, homozygosity for the M694V mutation in <em>MEFV</em>), with, and, very rarely, without the phenotype of FMF, TRAPS, the full spectrum of cryopyrinopathies (familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, which is also termed familial cold urticaria; Muckle-Wells syndrome; and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disorder), and mevalonate kinase deficiency (also known as hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome), with varying incidences depending upon disease and ethnic background [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The bulk of experience has focused on the central role of the NALP3 inflammasome, with mutations resulting in constitutive over production of IL-1 beta in the cryopyrinopathies, and on the efficacy of a commercially available IL-1-receptor antagonist, anakinra, in attenuating both disease and resulting amyloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. As yet, less information is available regarding the potential efficacy for AA amyloidosis of other synthetic agents (eg, caspase 1 inhibitors) or biologic agents (eg, monoclonal anti-IL-1 antibodies or IL-1 TRAP) that are effective in reducing cryopyrinopathy disease manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. With regard to TRAPS and FMF, both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> and anakinra have been reported as effective treatments for disease manifestations and for lowering of SAA levels, although anti-IL-1 treatments are increasingly favored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. However, similar efficacy to that seen with etanercept has not been obtained with use of other TNF inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, in patients with TRAPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]; and whether these agents are effective for preventing or reversing AA amyloidosis has not been described. IL-6 receptor blockade with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> may act downstream of inflammasome activation, and has been reported to be an effective therapy for AA amyloidosis complicating both FMF and TRAPS; in a series of 20 patients with autoinflammatory disease and AA amyloidosis, including four patients with renal transplants, a rapid drop in SAA levels to normal occurred within 10 days and was sustained through 23 months, with stabilization or regression of amyloid on SAP scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Anticytokine therapy remains an option for patients presenting with renal insufficiency who undergo renal transplantation as prophylaxis to prevent recurrence of AA amyloid in the allograft; in particular, IL-1 inhibitors may be especially beneficial in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/54,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,56</a>]. In addition, the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>), which is commonly used to prevent allograft rejection, may also slow progression of AA amyloid, based on animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Demonstration of the efficacy of available anticytokines holds the promise that novel monoclonal antibodies and low molecular weight inhibitors in phase <span class=\"nowrap\">2/3</span> trials may also prove useful for the inhibition of the deposition phase of SAA amyloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Identification of the central role of activation of the inflammasome in the generation of proinflammatory cytokines (eg IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-18) as a key pathogenic event in some autoinflammatory diseases that may be associated with the development of AA amyloid is also an active area of drug development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1947271475\"><span class=\"h2\">Interference with binding to cofactors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>New classes of agents may eventually prove efficacious by interfering with fibril formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].

In a preliminary report, this resulted in disappearance of deposits in three types of systemic amyloidosis (AL, ATTR, and AA), as assessed by SAP scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. This effect was sustained in follow-up studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]; however, approximately 20 percent of P-component remained associated with the amyloid deposits, which were only slowly resorbed. This limitation was addressed initially in a murine model for AA amyloid, in which SAP depletion following CPHPC was then followed with treatment using polyclonal anti-SAP, resulting in a rapid complement-dependent, macrophage-derived giant cell reaction that appeared to clear visceral amyloid deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Administration of a humanized monoclonal anti-SAP antibody following CPHPC treatment has been shown to trigger clearance of amyloid deposits from the liver, kidney, and other tissues in an early phase trial in patients with systemic amyloidosis, including a patient with AA amyloidosis, as well as patients with AL and hereditary forms of amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. This approach may provide a new and generic therapeutic approach to the treatment of systemic and possibly localized forms of amyloidosis.</p><p>An alternative approach is the use of monoclonal anti-AA antibodies as agents for the in vivo imaging of AA amyloidosis and potential mobilization of amyloid deposits from tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. One of these antibodies directed to an epitope derived from a cleavage site of SAA was found to recognize a cryptic epitope shared with human light chain (AL) amyloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-aa-secondary-amyloidosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], and has reached phase 3 testing for patients with primary amyloidosis (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02312206).
