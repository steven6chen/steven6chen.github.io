Doctors and nurses use this test for 2 reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To see whether a person has diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To see whether diabetes treatment is working the right way</p><p/><p>Other names for hemoglobin A1C are &quot;glycated hemoglobin,&quot; &quot;HbA1C,&quot; or just &quot;A1C.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27502375\"><span class=\"h1\">What should my A1C numbers be?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on why you have the test.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>When checking for diabetes</strong> &ndash; If you had an A1C test to see if you have diabetes, your A1C should be 6 or less.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If your A1C is 6.5 or higher, it probably means you have diabetes, but you should have the test done again to be sure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If your A1C is between 5.7 and 6.4, you are at risk for getting diabetes. You should probably start doing things that can help prevent diabetes. For example, you should become more active and lose weight (if you are overweight).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>When checking how treatment is working</strong> &ndash; If you already know you have diabetes, and you had an A1C test to see how well controlled your blood sugar is, your A1C should probably be 7 or less. But you need to check with your doctor on what your level should be. Not everyone with diabetes is the same. Some people need to aim for different A1C levels than others.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27502382\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do this test at home?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is now possible to buy kits to test your A1C at home. But home testing of A1C is not usually necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27502389\"><span class=\"h1\">How often should I have an A1C test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on whether you have diabetes and on what your last A1C test showed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you had an A1C test to check for diabetes and your A1C was less than 5.7 (meaning you do <strong>not</strong> have diabetes), you should have A1C tests done every 3 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you had an A1C test to check for diabetes and your A1C was between 5.7 and 6.4 (meaning you do not have diabetes but are at risk for it), you should have A1C tests done every 1 to 2 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you do have diabetes and your blood sugar is well controlled, you should have A1C tests every 6 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have diabetes and you recently changed treatment plans or you are having trouble controlling your blood sugar, you should have A1C tests every 3 months.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27502396\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do my A1C numbers matter?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies show that keeping A1C numbers close to normal helps keep people from getting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease that can cause blindness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve damage caused by diabetes (also called neuropathy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney disease</p><p/><p>For people with newly diagnosed diabetes, keeping the A1C close to normal might also prevent heart attacks and strokes in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27502403\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I still need to measure my blood sugar at home?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your doctor wants you to check your blood sugar at home, you should keep doing so even if you have routine A1C tests. Blood sugar tests tell you what your blood sugar is from moment to moment. That's important information to have, because it lets you know if your medications and lifestyle changes are keeping your blood sugar in a safe range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27502500\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-abcs-of-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: The ABCs of diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment for type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=using-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Using insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetic retinopathy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-damage-caused-by-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nerve damage caused by diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=keeping-your-childs-blood-sugar-under-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Keeping your child's blood sugar under control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=checking-your-childs-blood-sugar-level-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Checking your child's blood sugar level (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Overview (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-overview-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Overview (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
