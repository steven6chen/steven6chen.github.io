Symptoms due to SSP are generally more severe than those associated with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, presumably because patients with SSP have less pulmonary reserve due to underlying lung disease. Thus, any impairment of pulmonary function has a more noticeable effect. The intensity of dyspnea can range from a mild increase over baseline to impending cardiopulmonary failure when a tension pneumothorax develops. Patients with an infectious cause of SSP may also have cough, fever, chills, or fatigue.</p><p>Usually, the patient has a known underlying lung disease, although occasionally the SSP is the presenting manifestation, as with a malignancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91031069\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a small SSP, physical examination findings may be limited to those of the underlying lung disease. In contrast, characteristic physical findings of a large pneumothorax include decreased chest excursion, diminished breath sounds, absent fremitus, and hyperresonance to percussion on the affected side. Subcutaneous emphysema may be present. Labored breathing and hemodynamic compromise (eg, tachycardia, hypotension) may suggest a possible tension pneumothorax, which necessitates emergency decompression. Tracheal deviation from the midline is a rare and typically late finding in pneumothorax. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91031083\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial blood gases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial blood gases are typically obtained when a patient demonstrates tachypnea, accessory muscle use, a pulse oxygen saturation &lt;92 percent, or has a history of hypercapnia. In patients with SSP, arterial blood gases are frequently abnormal. In one study, the arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) was below 55 mmHg in 17 percent of patients and below 45 mmHg in 4 percent, while the arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) exceeded 50 mmHg in 16 percent and exceeded 60 mmHg in 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An upright chest radiograph is typically obtained as part of the evaluation of new or worsening dyspnea or chest discomfort in a patient with underlying lung disease. The chest radiograph provides the diagnosis of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) with the finding of a visceral pleural line, which defines the interface of the lung and pleural air (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56589\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56589 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71341\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71341 \">image 2</a>). If the diagnosis of SSP is unclear on the conventional chest radiograph, chest computed tomography is the best modality for determining the presence, size, and location of intrapleural air.

In general, the pleural line associated with a pneumothorax is convex relative to the lateral chest wall, whereas the pleural line associated with a large bulla is usually concave relative to the lateral chest wall. The two conditions can be easily differentiated by computed tomography of the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The size of the pneumothorax is generally determined based on the interpleural distance, which is the distance between the lung margin (visceral pleura) and the chest wall (parietal pleura) at the level of the hilum on a conventional, upright posterior-anterior chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A distance of 2 cm roughly correlates with a 50 percent pneumothorax, which is considered a large pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The tube thoracostomy group was more likely to have their pleural air completely evacuated than the needle aspiration group (93 versus 67 percent). The lower success rate of pleural aspiration in SSP than primary spontaneous pneumothorax may be due to a higher rate of persistent air leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

One retrospective study included 91 patients, 22 of whom were treated with a large bore (20 to 28 Fr) tube and 69 with a small bore (10 to 14 Fr) tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The choice is generally made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the severity of the underlying lung disease and the anticipated rate of air leakage. Traditionally, large bore tubes (24 to 28 Fr) have been used to decompress pneumothoraces in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, because of concerns about small bore tubes not being adequate for large volume air leaks during positive pressure ventilation. However, in a retrospective study of 62 patients with pneumothoraces complicating mechanical ventilation, small bore tubes were successful in 69 percent of pneumothoraces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In this study, small bore tubes were less likely to be successful when treating barotrauma-induced pneumothoraces, when compared with pneumothoraces caused by lung puncture during procedures such as central line insertion. Thus, patients who are clinically unstable (eg, tension pneumothorax) or who have barotrauma complicating mechanical ventilation are generally managed with a 24 to 28 French (Fr) chest tube, due to the increased risk for a large air leak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3139375\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest tube management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chest tube or catheter should be connected to a water seal device, generally without application of suction due to the risk of re-expansion pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Failure of the pneumothorax to resolve should lead to the initiation of suction if it was not initially applied. A Heimlich valve can also be used, although a water seal device is preferable because it allows monitoring of the rate of air leakage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes#H254981216\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;, section on 'Drainage system'</a>.)</p><p>In general, the chest tube should remain in place until a procedure is performed to prevent recurrent SSP. However, patients who decline preventive interventions can have their chest tube clamped twelve hours after the lung has expanded radiographically and no further air leak is detected via the chest tube. A chest radiograph should be performed 12 to 24 hours after the chest tube is clamped and, if the pneumothorax has not recurred, the chest tube can be removed. Caution is required in clamping a chest tube, because there is now no egress for air and, if an air leak resumed, a tension pneumothorax could develop. If the patient should become symptomatic, the chest tube should be promptly unclamped. However, if the tube is removed the same risks are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes#H254981706\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;, section on 'Removal'</a>.)</p><p>An alternative approach for stable patients whose lung is at least 90 percent expanded, but who have a persistent air leak, is to attach a Heimlich valve to the chest tube and discharge the patient to home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The advantage of this regimen is that it allows the patient to avoid a long-term hospitalization. However, a separate procedure to prevent a recurrent SSP is typically performed in patients who are surgical candidates.

For those who require an intervention for prolonged air leakage, the two procedures are typically performed at the same time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1032319\"><span class=\"h3\">Persistent air leakage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent air leaks are more common and tend to persist longer in SSP, compared to primary spontaneous pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Persistent air leaks may be due to subpleural bullae or cysts (eg, COPD, Pneumocystis pneumonia) or to necrotic lung (eg, pneumonia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. For patients who have a persistent air leak after three days of tube thoracostomy drainage or failure of the lung to re-expand fully, it becomes progressively less likely that the leak will close spontaneously and additional interventions may be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/15,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery</strong> &ndash; For surgical candidates with a persistent leak <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incomplete lung expansion (&lt;90 percent), the preferred procedure is stapling or resection of blebs and mechanical pleurodesis via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or open thoracotomy. As an alternative, VATS with <span class=\"nowrap\">stapling/resection</span> of blebs and intraoperative chemical pleurodesis can be performed. As pleurodesis is performed as part of the procedure, the two goals of closure of the air leak and prevention of recurrence are accomplished with one operation. Additional details of VATS and thoracotomy are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1032463\" class=\"local\">'Preventing recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood patch or chemical pleurodesis</strong> &ndash; For patients who have a persistent or refractory air leak but are not candidates for surgery, we suggest bedside application of a blood patch or chemical pleurodesis. A few case series have described the successful use of a pleural blood patch (also known as blood patch pleurodesis) for patients with a persistent air leak complicating acute respiratory distress syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-38</a>]. Blood patch pleurodesis is performed by drawing approximately 100 mL of the patient's venous blood without anticoagulants under sterile conditions and instilling it immediately into the pleural space through the chest tube. One review of ten observational studies that utilized the blood patch technique reported successful cessation of the air leak 92 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, another report suggested that empyema was a significant complication in 9 percent of patients treated with this modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chemical pleurodesis via the chest tube with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> derivative or size-calibrated talc is another option for management of a persistent air leak, although success is much lower than with VATS. The technique is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemical-pleurodesis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemical pleurodesis&quot;, section on 'Technique'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conservative management</strong> &ndash; Some patients with severe underlying lung disease who are poor surgical candidates may prefer a longer period of conservative management with supplemental oxygen and chest tube drainage. Spontaneous resolution has been described with conservative management after as long as 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/15,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1032463\"><span class=\"h3\">Preventing recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the patient has been stabilized and initial drainage of pleural air established, we advocate performing an intervention to prevent recurrence in almost all patients treated for an initial SSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This advice is based on the observation that recurrence of SSP is common and frequently life-threatening. One study reported a 50 percent likelihood of recurrent SSP over three years among patients with a SSP due to COPD, who did not have an intervention to prevent recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>As noted above, for patients with a persistent air leak, an intervention to control the leak and prevent recurrence (pleurodesis) is performed within a few (eg, three to five) days of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For patients with full re-expansion and no evidence of persistent air leak, surgery to prevent recurrence is typically performed during the same hospitalization prior to removal of the chest tube, because SSP tends to recur relatively early. </p><p>The three main options are thoracotomy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), and chemical pleurodesis. The decision among these options depends on the preferences of the surgical team and whether the patient is an operative candidate at present or a lung transplant candidate in the future. (See <a href=\"#H1032988\" class=\"local\">'Lung transplant candidates'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgical options</strong> &ndash; Meta-analyses comparing open thoracotomy with VATS have shown lower recurrence rates with open procedures (approximately 1 percent with open versus 5 percent with VATS), but with greater blood loss, more postoperative pain, and longer hospital stays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/15,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,39,40</a>]. Due to the potential for lower morbidity, VATS with stapling of blebs followed by obliteration of the pleural space is the preferred intervention in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/15,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,41,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several methods are available for obliteration of the pleural space, including pleural abrasion with dry gauze [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], apical pleurectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], intraoperative insufflation of talc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and laser abrasion of the parietal pleura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. We prefer mechanical pleurodesis, using pleural abrasion with gauze, because it is effective and simple to perform.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For surgical candidates who have a persistent air leak, the optimal surgical techniques to ensure closure of the air leak(s) are uncertain. Most surgeons recommend stapling of blebs, because recurrence rates are substantially higher if the blebs are not closed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. In contrast, in one study of patients with AIDS-related pulmonary infections, VATS-directed insufflation of talc was reported to be successful in seven out of eight patients without treatment directed to the site of the air leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with emphysema who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), it may be appropriate to perform LVRS at the time of surgical pleurodesis.

However, this technique is not as effective as the VATS with pleurodesis procedure described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/5,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,51</a>]. Chemical pleurodesis administered via the chest tube reduces the SSP recurrence rate from 40 to 50 percent to approximately 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/5,15,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15,52</a>]. It is performed by instilling a sclerosant into the pleural space. Although the choice of a sclerosant is controversial, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> over talc, because we believe it is the safer option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>].
