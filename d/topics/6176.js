The large number of men with the symptoms of this disorder, the easy access to diagnostic tests, and the availability of drug therapy make it appropriate for the primary care provider to participate in the management of men with this disorder. To do so requires an appreciation for what is known regarding the epidemiology and etiology of BPH, which will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and management of this disorder are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transurethral procedures for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prostate on average weighs 20 grams in normal 21- to 30-year-old men, and the weight changes little thereafter unless the man develops benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, because of the increased prevalence of BPH in older men, the mean prostate weight at autopsy increases after age 50 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71296\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71296 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of histologically diagnosed BPH increases from 8 percent in men aged 31 to 40, to 40 to 50 percent in men aged 51 to 60, to over 80 percent in men older than age 80 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55614 \">figure 2</a>). The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging compared the age-specific prevalence of pathologically defined BPH at autopsy with the clinical prevalence based upon history and the results of digital rectal examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There was good agreement between the clinical prevalence and autopsy incidence in men of all ages.</p><p>A major difficulty in comparing the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among different groups has been the lack of a common definition. The Olmsted County study found the prevalence of moderate or severe LUTS for men in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth decades of life to be 26, 33, 41, and 46 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a community-based group of 502 men aged 55 to 74 years without prostate cancer, the prevalence of BPH and LUTS was 19 percent using the criteria of a prostate volume above 30 mL and a high International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the prevalence was only 4 percent if the criteria were a prostate volume above 30 mL, a high IPSS, a maximal urinary flow rate below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec,</span> and a post-void residual urine volume greater than 50 mL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower urinary tract symptoms in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Race</strong> &ndash; Race has some influence on the risk for BPH severe enough to require surgery. While the age-adjusted relative risk (RR) of BPH necessitating surgery is similar in black and white men, black men less than 65 years old may need treatment more often than white men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a study of 34,624 men, compared with whites, Asians had a lower risk for nocturia (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9), physician-diagnosed BPH (RR 0.7, CI 0.2-0.5), and transurethral prostate surgery (RR 0.2, CI 0.1-0.6), while risks for blacks and whites were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the American Male Health Professional Study, men of Asian ancestry were less likely (RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) to undergo surgery for BPH as compared with white men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Black men had similar risk to white men in this study. In a community sample of 2480 men in the United States, moderate to severe LUTS were more common in blacks than in whites (41 versus 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and blacks had greater total and transitional zone prostate volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, there is evidence that differences in risk of LUTS is more related to socioeconomic factors such as income and insurance than to race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One study applied the American Urological Association symptom score to 289 Japanese men ranging in age from 40 to 79 years: the Japanese men had somewhat higher symptom scores than American men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The American men had an approximately 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/decade</span> increase in prostate size, as compared with 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/decade</span> for the Japanese men. This correlates with the lower age-specific prevalence of BPH in Japan. However, an autopsy study of men who lived in Beijing and Shanghai found that the frequency of BPH was similar to that in Western countries, although prostate cancer was much less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There have been inconsistent results across studies about the effects of various dietary components and supplements on the risk of symptomatic BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Family history of cancer</strong> &ndash; The relationship between cancer and BPH is unclear. One study found an increased risk of BPH in men with a family history of bladder cancer, but risk of BPH was not associated with a family history of prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormone levels</strong> &ndash; Some reports have suggested a relationship between BPH and hormone levels. Higher serum levels of testosterone and estradiol were associated with decreased risk of future development of symptomatic BPH in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There appears to be a weak inverse relationship between autopsy findings of BPH and cirrhosis. Men with advanced cirrhosis have lower urinary symptom scores, smaller prostate volumes, and higher ratios of serum estradiol to serum testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alcohol consumption</strong> &ndash; Alcohol consumption, particularly consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol (three or more drinks per day), which can reduce androgen levels, may reduce the risk of BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Alcohol consumption was also associated with a decreased risk of LUTS in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], though not all, other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vasectomy</strong> &ndash; There is no relationship between vasectomy and BPH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prostatitis</strong> &ndash; In a longitudinal, population-based study, prostatitis was associated with an increased risk of subsequent prostatism, enlarged prostate, and BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, in a study of prostate biopsies done for any indication, inflammation of the peripheral zone of the prostate was not strongly associated with LUTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>NSAIDs</strong> &ndash; An observational study found an inverse association between use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and risk of BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; this may be related to actual improvements in BPH when men take NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obesity or metabolic syndrome</strong> &ndash; Obesity, elevated fasting glucose, and diabetes have been associated with an increased risk of LUTS, whereas high adiponectin levels were associated with reduced risk of symptomatic BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In a cross-sectional study using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink, metabolic syndrome was diagnosed in 26.5 percent of men with clinical BPH and 20.9 percent of matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Two meta-analyses found that men with the metabolic syndrome had higher prostate growth rates and larger prostate volume than those without the metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. An increased waist-hip ratio, an estimate of central obesity, has been associated with increased severity of prostate inflammation; however, prostate size was not associated with proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Men with the metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are more likely to have severe prostatic inflammation than men with only one metabolic alteration (75.8 versus 24.2 percent, p&lt;0.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other</strong> &ndash; In the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, increased risk of BPH was associated with higher free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, heart disease, and use of beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The 2001 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) also found co-occurrence of erectile dysfunction and BPH in about 10 percent of men age 40 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Sleep-related problems may be associated with LUTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Massachusetts Male Aging Study found that a decreased risk of BPH was associated with cigarette smoking (1 to 20 per day) and higher levels of physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Exercise was also associated with a decreased risk of LUTS in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, risk was not altered by total fat caloric intake, sexual activity, alcohol intake, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, diabetes, or serum levels of androgens or estrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, in other studies, a higher diastolic blood pressure was associated with increased incidence of LUTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

The hyperplastic nodules are comprised primarily of stromal components and to a lesser degree epithelial cells; stereologic measurements have revealed a fourfold increase in stroma and a twofold increase in glandular components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In one immunohistochemical study, stroma comprised 62 percent of the volume, epithelium 15 percent, and glandular lumens 23 percent; the stromal-to-epithelial ratio was 4.6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Some studies have found inflammation to be a common finding in BPH tissue. Inflammation was assessed by cytological and immunohistochemical parameters in 282 surgical specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The investigators found a high correlation between inflammation, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and prostate volume. A study of the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial found that low-soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II and elevated interleukin-6 concentrations were associated with increased BPH risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older age and the presence of functioning Leydig cells of the testes are essential for the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Thus, BPH is very rare in hypogonadal men with onset before age 40 years who are not treated with androgen. Studies have examined the molecular and cellular changes associated with BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. It is likely that multiple factors are causally related to the development of BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of BPH remains incompletely understood. Population-based observational studies, disease registries, biochemical, molecular and histochemical analyses of BPH tissue, in vitro studies of human tissue, and clinical trials continue to contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of this common disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Androgen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The necessity for androgen, in particular dihydrotestosterone (DHT), during prostate development is best illustrated by observations in men with congenital deficiency of 5-alpha-reductase activity (type 2), the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT in the prostate and other androgen-sensitive tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Men with this disorder have a rudimentary prostate throughout life despite normal serum testosterone concentrations and normal androgen receptors (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency&quot;</a>). The importance of androgen in the development of BPH is seen in androgen's ability to induce BPH in dogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>], as well as the regression of BPH in men when serum testosterone concentrations are lowered with medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-treatment-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, the concentrations of DHT in prostatic tissue are not higher in men with BPH than in those without BPH. Thus, excess intraprostatic conversion of testosterone to DHT is not responsible for the development of BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. There may be, however, changes in androgen receptors in the prostate. These receptors are primarily located in epithelial cells in normal prostatic tissue, as compared with a more heterogeneous distribution (epithelial and stromal cells) in hyperplastic prostatic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A segment of DNA for the androgen receptor (AR) encodes for a variable number of glutamine repeats. Results of one study suggest that risk of surgery for BPH is increased with decreased CAG (trinucleotide cytosine-adenine-guanine) repeats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]; however, analysis of 416 BPH cases and 527 controls from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial failed to find an association between CAG repeat length and BPH risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. One study reported an increase in coactivators and another noted a decrease in corepressors of the androgen receptor in BPH tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Subsequent experiments suggest that DHT stimulates response elements for a calcium-activated chloride channel to cause prostate enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Serum testosterone or DHT concentrations do not appear to be higher in men in whom the prostate ultimately becomes hyperplastic than in men in whom it does not. The Physicians' Health Study found similar serum testosterone concentrations at the initial examination in 320 men who had BPH treated surgically up to nine years later and 320 men who did not develop prostatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. A nested case-control study of steroid concentrations and risk of BPH found that the lowest quartiles of testosterone, estradiol, and testosterone:17beta-diol-glucoronide ratio were associated with the highest risk of BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In summary, the available evidence indicates that testosterone and DHT are necessary but not sufficient to cause BPH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most compelling evidence for a role of estrogen in the pathogenesis of BPH is that induction of the disorder in dogs is potentiated by the addition of estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. This relationship has been partially explained by estrogen induction of androgen receptors. In addition, the finding of an increase in the ratio of estrogen to androgen in the serum in older men suggests a possible role for estrogen in the maintenance, but not necessarily the causation, of BPH. The age-related increase in the serum estrogen-androgen ratio is associated with an increase in the estrogen-androgen ratio in prostatic tissue, especially in the stroma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The prostate also contains the enzymes needed to convert dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and testosterone to estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The results of other studies relating estrogen with BPH are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/55,58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,58-61</a>].

However, mepartricin, an antifungal agent that also reduces serum estrogen concentrations, has been reported to improve symptoms and peak flow rates without changing prostate volume or serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysregulation of stromal growth factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since BPH is primarily a disease of the stroma, the stroma might have intrinsic properties that enable it to proliferate and also to induce hyperplasia of the epithelium. In the presence of androgen, mesenchymal tissue derived from the urogenital sinus can induce differentiation of prostate epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. By contrast, stroma lacking functional androgen receptors cannot induce differentiation of normal epithelium. These observations emphasize the importance of the stroma in development of the prostate.</p><p>It has been suggested that BPH occurs because prostatic tissue reverts to an embryonic-like state in which it is more sensitive to various growth factors. Tissue concentrations of several growth factors are increased in hyperplastic prostatic tissue as compared with normal prostatic tissue. The most consistent increases are in several fibroblast growth factors, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II, and transforming growth factor-beta and the mRNAs for these substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/66-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-71</a>]. In vitro, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, several fibroblast growth factors, and IGF-I and -II stimulate and transforming growth factor-beta inhibits prostatic epithelial cell growth. Most of these factors stimulate stromal cell growth. A nested case control study found that serum IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) was inversely associated with BPH risk among men with severe symptoms, while the IGF-1:IGFBP3 ratio was positively associated with BPH risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. T lymphocytes and macrophages appear to play an important role in the induction of cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9903785\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory infiltrates are present in up to 70 percent of the prostates of patients with BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The cause for the inflammation has not been identified with certainty; possible etiologies include obesity, autoimmune processes, and chronic infections.</p><p>BPH is more common in obese patients and obesity is associated with increased inflammatory cytokines. Dietary fats have been implicated, and lipopolysaccharides can induce prostatic inflammation in experimental animals. It has been hypothesized that macrophages secrete cytokines that stimulate stromal and epithelial hyperplasia. Investigators have found increased concentrations of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, which can be secreted by epithelial cells and is known to be induced by proinflammatory cytokines and to be involved in testosterone-mediated hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. HIF-1 alpha enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition in experimental models. These investigators proposed that developing agents that block the effects of HIF-1 alpha could provide a new approach to treatment of BPH. If inflammation is a causal mechanism for BPH, it also could provide an explanation for improvement with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There is also some evidence that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors decrease fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation, which could be a mechanism by which they decrease symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Inflammation could be caused by an autoimmune process or in response to chronic infection. Investigators have failed to associate BPH with any of 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The lymphotoxin-beta-receptor (LT-beta-R) gene has been reported to be involved in autoimmune disease and inflammatory disorders. Korean investigators found nucleotide polymorphisms located in the promoter and coding regions of LT-beta-R in BPH tissue, and an allele was significantly associated with BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Heat shock protein (HSP) 27 also is known as a mediator in immune responses. Expression of HSP27 is reported to increase with increasing inflammation in BPH tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Investigators have sought to identify chronic infections that might cause prostatitis. One possibility is <em>Escherichia coli</em>. It is postulated that phospholipase D, which is attached to the outer membrane of <em>E. coli</em>, stimulates the production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and LPA stimulates other factors that cause inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Zinc, which is known to affect some prostate processes, can enhance LPA stimulation in BPH smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Infection with trichomonads also has been shown to induce migration and activation of mast cells, which can induce proliferation of prostate stromal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Another approach to understanding inflammation in BPH tissue has been to measure heme oxygenase (HO). HO has been found to be inversely related to metaflammation in the prostate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased cell death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average lifespan of stromal cells exceeds 30 years, while the average lifespan of epithelial cells exceeds two years. These observations are consistent with the infrequency with which mitoses or apoptotic bodies are seen in hyperplastic prostatic tissue and indicate that decreased cell death may be a major contributor to prostatic hyperplasia and enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Increased immunoreactivity for interleukin-2 and its receptors and bcl-2 expression are consistent with a lower apoptotic rate in BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. These observations also attest to the difficulty in causing regression of established BPH in the absence of increasing cell death. Furthermore, androgen deprivation does not alter bcl-2 expression, which has been found to be increased in hyperplastic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased stem cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increase in stem cells that reside in the basal epithelial compartment is hypothesized to cause BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Studies in animal models have found that in rats, the size of the prostate is defined by the absolute number of potential stem cells and their subsequent recruitment and maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>].

In one study, men with three or more affected family members had large prostate glands, above-normal serum androgen concentrations, and a normal response to 5-alpha-reductase inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. In a survey of men in Olmsted County, Minnesota, 21 percent of 2119 men between 40 and 70 years of age had a family history of an enlarged prostate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The odds ratio of a man with a positive family history of BPH having moderate to severe LUTS was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.7).</p><p>The possible role of genetic factors was evaluated in several studies. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of men from three independent populations indicated that genetic variants of&nbsp;GATA3&nbsp;may play a role in the inherited susceptibility and etiology of <span class=\"nowrap\">BPH/LUTS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of genes that may cause urinary symptoms in men only found a variant of the vitamin D receptor that was consistently protective across different populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. In a case-control study of men under 64 years of age who had undergone prostatectomy for BPH and in whom more than 37 grams of tissue was resected, the first-degree relatives of these men had a fourfold increased risk of developing BPH that required surgical therapy as compared with the relatives of normal men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Segregation analysis suggested an autosomal dominant mode of disease transmission (with an estimated penetrance of 0.89) and an allele frequency of 3.4 percent in the population. Hereditary BPH could account for 9 percent of all cases requiring surgery and for more than 50 percent in men under 60 years of age. One study evaluated genes expressed in prostates that were &lt;60 mL and compared them with glands &gt;60 mL in men undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Analyses of microarrays revealed 227 genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups.
