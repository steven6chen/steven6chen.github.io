Its transmural inflammatory nature coupled with the variability of intestinal distribution (ie, which intestinal segment is affected) and systemic manifestations, gives rise to a spectrum of clinical presentations and long-term risks that have to be considered in deciding the optimal therapeutic approach. </p><p>The choice of therapy varies depending upon the anatomic location of disease, the severity of disease, and whether the treatment goal is to induce remission or maintain remission.

Two commonly used systems are the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-crohns-disease-activity-index-cdai-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-harvey-bradshaw-index-of-crohns-disease-activity\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-medical-management-of-mild-low-risk-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], which is a simplified derivative of the CDAI. The HBI has been shown to correlate with the CDAI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-medical-management-of-mild-low-risk-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A drop in the CDAI of 100 points corresponds to a 3-point drop in the HBI. A CDAI of &lt;150 (ie, clinical remission) corresponds to an HBI of &lt;4. These Crohn disease activity scoring systems rely on subjective symptoms, and while still utilized in clinical research trials, there is an emerging construct that defines disease burden in terms of objective findings and the presence or absence of bowel destruction. In addition, clinical trials are increasingly utilizing patient-reported outcomes to assess disease activity in Crohn disease. </p><p>In clinical practice, the following working definitions may be more useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-medical-management-of-mild-low-risk-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical remission (CDAI &lt;150) &ndash; These patients are asymptomatic and without symptomatic inflammatory sequelae.

For example, the PROSPECT index, based on clinical, serologic, and genetic variables, is a validated tool that can be used to predict the risk of developing a Crohn disease-related complication or progression to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-medical-management-of-mild-low-risk-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, the activity and severity of inflammatory bowel disease occur on a continuum, and some patients may not clearly fit into a specific category based on the clinical features and long-term risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STEP-UP VERSUS TOP-DOWN THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two general approaches to the treatment of Crohn disease: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step-up therapy &ndash; </strong>Step-up therapy typically starts with less potent medications that are often associated with fewer side effects. More potent and potentially more toxic medications are used only if the initial therapies are ineffective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Top-down therapy &ndash; </strong>Top-down therapy starts with more potent therapies, such as biologic therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunomodulator therapy, relatively early in the course of the disease before patients become glucocorticoid dependent, and possibly even before they receive glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>When treating patients with mild Crohn disease who are low-risk, we favor step-up therapy, beginning treatment with less potent drugs that have relatively long track records and good safety profiles. We then progress to more potent treatments in patients whose disease does not respond to initial treatments or who require more than one course of glucocorticoids. Such an approach spares these low-risk patients the adverse effects of drugs that they may not need. </p><p>In contrast, high-risk patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease should be initiated on biologic or immunomodulator therapy in a top-down approach; the more potent therapies are more likely to be associated with more rapid onset of clinical remission and more favorable long-term side effect profile compared with glucocorticoids. In a trial 133 patients with newly diagnosed Crohn disease who were randomly assigned to receive combination therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>) or glucocorticoids followed by azathioprine and infliximab as needed, more patients in the combination group achieved clinical remission at 26 and at 52 weeks compared with the glucocorticoid group (60 versus 36 percent, and 62 verus 42 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-medical-management-of-mild-low-risk-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

These patients usually have no to mild symptoms and lack signs of systemic inflammation (ie, normal or mild elevation in C-reactive protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fecal calprotectin levels). (See <a href=\"#H15820128\" class=\"local\">'Low- versus moderate/high-risk patients'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two general approaches to the outpatient treatment of Crohn disease: step-up therapy and top-down therapy. Step-up therapy starts with medications that are less potent and associated with fewer side effects. If those therapies are ineffective, more potent (and potentially more toxic) medications are used. Top-down therapy starts with more potent therapies, such as biologic therapy or immunomodulator therapy, relatively early in the course of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, we favor step-up therapy for low-risk patients with mild Crohn disease, but top-down therapy for patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Step-up versus top-down therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For induction of remission in low-risk patients with mild Crohn disease affecting the ileum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right colon, we suggest starting controlled ileal release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> 9 mg by mouth daily (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Ileum and/or proximal colon involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For low-risk patients with diffuse Crohn colitis or left-sided colonic disease, we suggest initial therapy with oral glucocorticoids (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sulfasalazine</a> is an alternative option in patients with left-sided colonic Crohn disease. (See <a href=\"#H2396696703\" class=\"local\">'Diffuse colitis or left colonic involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For low-risk patients with mild Crohn disease who achieved remission with a glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>), we taper and then discontinue the glucocorticoid, followed by clinical observation and ileocolonoscopy in six to 12 months. Conventional glucocorticoids (ie, prednisone) should not be used to maintain remission given their side effect profile. (See <a href=\"#H4038653\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of remission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have achieved clinical remission with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> but who are unable to stop glucocorticoids after six months, we suggest maintenance therapy with an immunomodulator or biologic agent.
