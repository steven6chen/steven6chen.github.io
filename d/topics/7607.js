When people do have symptoms, they are due to other conditions that can happen with gastritis, like ulcers. Symptoms from ulcers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the upper belly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling bloated, or feeling full after eating a small amount of food</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased appetite</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting blood, or having black-colored bowel movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling more tired than usual &ndash; This happens if people with gastritis get a condition called &quot;anemia.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279767659\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have belly pain that gets worse or doesn't go away</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You vomit blood or have black bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are losing weight (without trying to)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279767666\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she might also do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An upper endoscopy &ndash; During this procedure, the doctor puts a thin tube with a camera on the end into your mouth and down into your stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>). He or she will look at the inside of your stomach. During the procedure, he or she might also do a test called a biopsy. For a biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of the stomach lining. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to check for H. pylori infection. These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Breath tests &ndash; These tests measure substances in your breath after you drink a special liquid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tests on a small sample of your bowel movement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">barium</a> swallow &ndash; Your doctor will give you a drink called &quot;barium.&quot; Then he or she will take an X-ray as the barium moves through your stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to check for anemia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279767673\"><span class=\"h1\">How is gastritis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what's causing your gastritis.</p><p>For example, if NSAIDs are causing your gastritis, your doctor will recommend that you not take those medicines. If alcohol is causing your gastritis, he or she will recommend that you stop drinking alcohol.</p><p>Doctors can use medicines to treat gastritis caused by an H. pylori infection. Most people take 3 or more medicines for 2 weeks. The treatment includes antibiotics plus medicine that helps the stomach make less acid.</p><p>Doctors can use medicines that reduce or block stomach acid to treat other causes of gastritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78918 \">table 1</a>). The main types of medicines that reduce or block stomach acid are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antacids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surface agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histamine blockers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proton pump inhibitors</p><p/><p>If your doctor recommends acid-reducing treatment, he or she will tell you which medicine to use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279767680\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes, people who are treated for an H. pylori infection need follow-up tests to make sure the infection is gone. Follow-up tests include breath tests, lab tests on a sample of bowel movement, or endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279767736\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=h-pylori-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: H. pylori infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peptic ulcers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomach-ache-and-stomach-upset-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stomach ache and stomach upset (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Peptic ulcer disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upset-stomach-functional-dyspepsia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upset stomach (functional dyspepsia) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
