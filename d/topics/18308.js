Tilt table testing may be helpful in patients in whom the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope is suspected but not certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. It is also useful in older persons in whom the cause of syncope remains unclear, but vasovagal syncope is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. </p><p>The indications for tilt table testing, along with a description of the procedures and discussion of the results, will be reviewed here. The general evaluation of the patient with transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) and suspected syncope, as well as a detailed discussion of reflex syncope, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reflex syncope in adults and adolescents: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1673686322\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND CAUSES OF SYNCOPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Syncope is a clinical syndrome in which transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) is caused by a period of inadequate cerebral nutrient flow, most often the result of an abrupt drop of systemic blood pressure. Typically, the inadequate cerebral nutrient flow is of relatively brief duration (8 to 10 seconds) and, in syncope, is by definition spontaneously self-limited. </p><p>Loss of postural tone is inevitable with loss of consciousness, and consequently syncope usually is associated with collapse, which may trigger injury due to a fall (such as may occur if the person is standing) or other type of accident (eg, if syncope occurs while driving). Recovery from true syncope is usually complete and rapid, with episodes rarely lasting more than a minute or two. Longer periods of real or apparent loss of consciousness suggest that the event is not syncope.</p><p>Syncope is but one form of TLOC. The possible causes of TLOC resulting in true syncope are generally grouped into four major categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflex syncope (also termed neurally-mediated reflex syncope)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthostatic syncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac arrhythmias</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural cardiopulmonary disease</p><p/><p>In addition to the causes of true syncope, in the evaluation of a patient with TLOC in whom syncope is suspected, the clinician must also consider and exclude conditions that mimic syncope but are not true syncope. The most common of these conditions are seizures, sleep disturbances, accidental falls, and some psychiatric conditions (eg, pseudosyncope and pseudoseizures). The major causes of syncope are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, our approach to tilt table testing is consistent with the published recommendations of various professional societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/1,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5</a>]. With the understanding that tilt table testing is an imperfect test for the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope due to limited sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, we recommend tilt table testing for patients in the following instances (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Test performance'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with recurrent episodes of syncope of unknown cause in the absence of structural heart disease, or in the presence of structural heart disease after cardiac causes of syncope (ie, arrhythmias) have been excluded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected vasovagal syncope who lack a confident diagnosis after the initial assessment or who do not have clear diagnostic features. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a single unexplained syncopal episode in high-risk settings (eg, occurrence or potential risk for physical injury or occupational hazard).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients for whom there is clinical value of demonstrating susceptibility to reflex syncope.

The drug-free test duration is approximately 20 minutes in most laboratories. Thereafter, if the initial drug-free portion of the test is negative, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> may be given as provocative diagnostic agents, and the test is carried out for an additional 10 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60161 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88516892\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient preparation and necessary equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient preparation, along with the facilities and equipment necessary for performing a tilt table test, are straightforward (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60161 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should fast at least three to four hours before the test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the clinical circumstances, patients may be asked to take their usual meds or alternatively hold their usual drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The test should be performed in a quiet room with a comfortable temperature and minimal distractions for the patient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should have an intravenous catheter placed prior to the procedure, allowing for administration of fluids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medications (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>) if needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is placed on a motorized tilt-table with a foot board and safety restraints. The bed should be capable of smoothly and rapidly moving the patient passively from a supine position to a head-up position between 60 to 80 degrees and quickly (in &lt;10 seconds) returning the patient to a supine position to avoid the consequences of prolonged hypotension. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) and beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring are employed throughout the test. Careful monitoring is required because many patients have a pronounced cardioinhibitory response characterized by symptomatic hypotension, bradycardia, or both. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is no defined consensus regarding ECG monitoring, but most tests are performed using either three or six ECG leads. Conventional limb leads are commonly used as they are convenient and offer more than adequate monitoring to assess for changes in heart rate and rhythm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood pressure recording should be beat-to-beat and is typically non-invasive. Invasive arterial monitoring is rarely used with current tilt table tests, but it is acceptable as long as the line is placed at least an hour before the procedure to allow autonomic tone to return to baseline. Intermittent blood pressure measurement via sphygmomanometer is not adequate as the number of data points precludes identifying developing problems and even more importantly the cuff disturbance alters patient autonomics and may thereby undermine the objective of the study.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tilt protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of protocols have been described for the test that vary in the angle of tilt (60 to 70 degrees above supine), duration of tilt (10 to 60 minutes), and the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60161 \">table 1</a>). The most commonly used protocol is described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2687323813\"><span class=\"h3\">Starting the test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To begin the test, the patient is monitored in the supine position for 5 to 10 minutes to obtain baseline heart rate and blood pressure measurements. If venous or arterial cannulation other than a routine intravenous line is performed just prior to the test, a longer supine time period of at least 20 minutes is recommended in order to allow any stimulated circulating catecholamines to return to baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The patient should be instructed to remain as calm and relaxed as possible and to report any symptoms that may develop. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3262323217\"><span class=\"h3\">Passive phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A passive phase (upright with no <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> infusion) of usually 20 minutes is performed first, with the patient positioned in a head-up tilt position at a tilt angle between 60 and 70 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Heart rate and symptoms are recorded every three to five minutes, and the ECG is recorded continuously. The blood pressure should be monitored non-invasively by beat-to-beat finger arterial monitoring. Alternatively, but much less desirable, the blood pressure may be non-invasively monitored by an arm cuff every three to five minutes. </p><p>Possible outcomes resulting from the passive phase include a positive response for reflex syncope, a positive response for psychogenic pseudosyncope, and a nondiagnostic response. If no symptoms have developed after a period of 20 minutes, the patient is returned to the supine position, and the test is considered nondiagnostic for reflex syncope. The decision to proceed with a drug provocation phase is up to the discretion of the clinician and is generally determined by the perceived necessity of inducing a response suggestive of reflex syncope. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Test interpretation'</a> below.)</p><p>It may be possible to reduce the time necessary for the tilt table test and avoid the need for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> infusion based upon the heart rate response early in the passive phase. In a study of 109 patients, a heart rate change &le;18 beats per minute during the first six minutes of the test prospectively predicted a negative tilt table test with a 96 percent specificity, 98 percent positive predictive accuracy, and 87 percent sensitivity, even with the subsequent use of isoproterenol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, this shortened procedure is not widely used and is not our recommended approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1948117310\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug provocation phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient has remained asymptomatic during the passive phase of tilt table testing, a second tilt table test is often performed after a vasoactive medication (usually either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>) is administered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60161 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Either drug can be used for the drug provocation phase, with the choice of isoproterenol or nitroglycerin usually directed by local practice and clinician expertise. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Isoproterenol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the passive phase is negative and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a> infusion is chosen, the infusion is administered with the patient in the supine position, although some advocate for the infusion to be initiated with the patient already in the 60 to 70 degree head-up tilt position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Isoproterenol is usually titrated from 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/minute</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60161 \">table 1</a>) to increase the heart rate by 20 to 25 percent above baseline. Once the desired heart rate has been achieved, the patient is placed in the 60 to 70 degree head-up tilt position for an additional 15 to 20 minutes. Generally, loss of consciousness during isoproterenol infusion is required to consider the test positive, although the 2009 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines include no separate diagnostic criteria for tilt table testing following isoproterenol infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A modest decrease in blood pressure with symptoms is common with isoproterenol and is nonspecific. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Isoproterenol</a> may trigger vasovagal syncope somewhat paradoxically. The mechanism is thought to be due to activation of central circulation mechanoreceptors, but the exact basis for the effect is not absolutely known. The potential efficacy of isoproterenol infusion was illustrated in a study in which a single-stage isoproterenol tilt table test more frequently induced syncope than a standard passive tilt table test (56 versus 32 percent) and reduced the time necessary for the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There was, however, a lower specificity (83 versus 91 percent for standard tilt table testing).

The use of intravenously administered nitroglycerin has been described but is rarely used. Generally, loss of consciousness following nitroglycerin administration is required to consider the test positive, although the 2009 ESC guidelines include no separate diagnostic criteria for tilt table testing using nitroglycerin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A modest decrease in blood pressure with symptoms is common with nitroglycerin and is nonspecific.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitroglycerin</a> likely increases susceptibility to vasovagal syncope by reducing venous return to the heart and thereby enhancing cardiac activity and activating central cardiac mechanoreceptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].

The addition of nitroglycerin to tilt table testing increases the frequency of hemodynamic changes and reproduction of symptoms and may shorten test duration but also increases the rate of false positive tests. In a study of 232 patients, including 149 with unexplained syncope and 83 asymptomatic controls, participants were randomly assigned to receive nitroglycerin (800 mcg metered spray) and a 20-minute tilt table test or no nitroglycerin and a standard 40-minute tilt table test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The response to tilt table testing can be highly variable such that a patient may display a cardioinhibitory response on one day and a vasodepressor response on another day. Additionally, factors such as prior history of syncope, age, and the use of medications during the protocol all seem to have an effect on the likelihood of a positive test. Ultimately, in all patients with syncope, obtaining a thorough history as part of the initial evaluation is the most important thing clinicians can do to make the appropriate diagnosis and direct further diagnostic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H14005354\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.) </p><p>The sensitivity of tilt table testing is as high as 80 percent, depending upon the protocol and patient selection, but this high sensitivity is at the expense of a lowered specificity (ie, more false positive tests). Among individuals who undergo a tilt table test with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a>, a positive response is seen in as many as 45 percent or more of those who do not have a history of syncope (ie, induction of syncope in normal volunteers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The reported false negative rate is as high as 14 to 30 percent, but can be higher depending upon the protocol and patient age. However, the true false negative rate is difficult to determine since there is no gold standard for comparison. Thus, vasovagal syncope cannot be excluded by a negative tilt table test.</p><p>The mechanism for syncope during tilt table testing appears to be different in normals (false positive results) and patients with a history of vasovagal syncope. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that compared eight normals with a positive tilt table test, eight normals with a negative tilt table test, and 15 patients with vasovagal syncope, patients with vasovagal syncope had a shorter time to syncope (9.5 versus 17 minutes), an immediate and persistent drop in mean blood pressure, more rapid peripheral pooling of blood, and higher peak serum epinephrine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 145 patients with a history of presyncope or syncope, patients with a history of recurrent syncope were significantly more likely to have a positive test compared with those with a single episode or with recurrent presyncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/upright-tilt-table-testing-in-the-evaluation-of-syncope/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Additionally, patients with structural heart disease or with a noncardiovascular cause for syncope were significantly less likely to have a positive test (16 versus 42 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67278\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67278 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p>The response to tilt table testing appears to vary with the patient age.
