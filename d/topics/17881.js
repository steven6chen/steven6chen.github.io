While less common in men than women, over 8 million men in the United States have low bone mass or osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The mortality rate associated with hip fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], as well as vertebral and other major fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], is higher in men than in women. In addition, men are even less likely than women to be evaluated or receive antiresorptive therapy after a hip fracture (4.5 versus 49.5 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>The treatment of osteoporosis in men consists of lifestyle measures and drug or hormonal therapy. An overview of the approach to therapy of osteoporosis in men will be presented here. The diagnosis, evaluation, and epidemiology of osteoporosis in men are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFESTYLE MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, lifestyle modifications should be encouraged for all men with osteoporosis. A weight-bearing exercise regimen may be modestly beneficial, given the association of reduced physical activity with bone loss and fracture in older men and the positive effect of exercise in women with osteoporosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteoporosis-in-men#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteoporosis in men&quot;, section on 'Physical activity and strength'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a>). In addition, smoking and excessive alcohol intake should be avoided.</p><p>As a general rule, men with osteoporosis should receive adequate calcium (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in younger men, 1000 to 1200 mg daily in older men, total diet plus supplement) and vitamin D (600 to 800 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day)</span> supplementation. Older persons confined indoors and other high-risk groups may have low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at this intake level and may require higher intakes of vitamin D. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H1310134670\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Groups at high risk'</a>.)</p><p>In some trials, calcium and vitamin D have been shown to reduce fracture risk in men and women when administered at a dose of at least 700 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;</a>). However, in most cases, the addition of pharmacologic or hormonal therapy is necessary for the treatment of osteoporosis in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF SECONDARY CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a cause of osteoporosis is identified, it should be treated. As an example, potential offending agents (eg, glucocorticoids, alcohol, tobacco, etc) should be eliminated whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Testosterone therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> therapy has beneficial effects on bone mineral density (BMD) and other consequences of hypogonadism, we recommend testosterone replacement therapy for hypogonadal men (as evidenced by clinical symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and a distinctly subnormal serum testosterone concentration) or men who have an unequivocal cause for hypogonadism (eg, pituitary tumor, Klinefelter syndrome, gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] deficiency, etc) and who do not have contraindications to testosterone therapy. The diagnosis of hypogonadism and details of testosterone therapy, including a discussion of possible increases in cardiovascular risk with testosterone therapy, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testosterone treatment of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Young, hypogonadal men</strong> &ndash; Hypogonadism is among the most commonly identified causes of osteoporosis in men. Several studies have demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> replacement increases BMD in young men with hypogonadism associated with a clear etiology (eg, pituitary tumors, Klinefelter syndrome, GnRH deficiency etc). For example, in one report of 36 men with previously untreated, acquired hypogonadism, most of whom had pituitary tumors, spinal BMD increased (5 percent by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] and 14 percent by computed tomography [CT]) during 12 to 18 months of intramuscular testosterone replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations and urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline, markers of bone formation and resorption, respectively, both decreased significantly, suggesting that the beneficial effects of testosterone replacement were due to its ability to suppress bone turnover.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similar results were reported in a larger group of 72 men with hypogonadism, many of whom had GnRH deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50233\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50233 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The mean BMD increased from 95 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/cm<sup>3</sup></span> in the first year of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> replacement, and in some men, it eventually normalized. The response was greatest in previously untreated men with the lowest BMD at baseline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testosterone treatment of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Testosterone</a> replacement also increases BMD, primarily cortical BMD, in men with hyperprolactinemic hypogonadism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] or idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65580\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65580 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The effect is most marked in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism who are still skeletally immature when treatment is initiated, although, even with prolonged therapy, BMD remains low in these men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Older men</strong> &ndash; Few studies have examined the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> on BMD in older men. In one study of 211 men over age 65 years whose baseline mean serum testosterone concentration was approximately 235 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (8.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> 12 months of testosterone replacement significantly increased mean lumbar spine trabecular volumetric (v) BMD (7.5 versus 0.8 percent), as well as lumbar peripheral and hip trabecular and peripheral vBMD, as measured by quantitative CT (QCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There was also a significant but less impressive increase in areal BMD (DXA) of the lumbar spine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In another study, intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> administration increased spine and hip BMD (DXA) significantly in 70 men aged 65 years or older whose baseline testosterone levels were &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (12.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> on two occasions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Another study in men aged 60 years or older with baseline testosterone levels &lt;320 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> found that intramuscular testosterone increased BMD (DXA) at the spine but not at the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These data suggest that only men with serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> levels below the normal range are likely to have skeletal benefits of testosterone therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20461678\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid therapy is associated with an appreciable risk of bone loss, which is most pronounced in the first few months of use. In addition, glucocorticoids increase fracture risk, and fractures occur at higher BMD values than occur in postmenopausal osteoporosis. The increased risk of fracture has been reported with doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or its equivalent as low as 2.5 to 7.5 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, glucocorticoid-induced bone loss should be treated aggressively, particularly in those already at high risk for fracture (older, prior fragility fracture). In other individuals, clinical risk factor and BMD assessment may help guide therapy. The prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss in men and women is reviewed in detail separately.

Bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> have been shown to increase BMD. Denosumab has also been shown to reduce vertebral fractures in such men. This topic is reviewed in detail separately.

A reasonable cutpoint that may be cost effective in some settings is a 10-year probability of hip fracture or combined major osteoporotic fracture of &ge;3.0 or &ge;20 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We calculate fracture probability using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (<a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=Is0F5/ImQqBopGKrWR2x/MCmpmhgzdFRoihp7Vybx7uk/lvW7TmyNtcbx4DNfIl6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2059\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX</a>). Although the United States-adapted fracture prediction algorithm provides general clinical guidance, osteoporosis treatment should remain individualized through shared decision making between patient and clinician. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Fracture risk assessment'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-men#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in men&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>One area of uncertainty is the selection of hypogonadal men, who are already treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> therapy, for additional pharmacologic therapy. There are no clinical trial data that address this question, and in particular, the effect of testosterone therapy on fracture risk has not been evaluated. We agree with guidelines from the Endocrine Society for management of men with osteoporosis that suggest adding a pharmacologic agent with proven antifracture efficacy (eg, a bisphosphonate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=teriparatide-recombinant-human-parathyroid-hormone-1-34-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">teriparatide</a>) in hypogonadal men whose risk of fracture is felt to be high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the absence of definitive data upon which to objectively classify fracture risk in men, high-risk groups might include men on high-dose glucocorticoids; men with frequent falls; men who have had a recent fragility fracture, particularly if they have a BMD T-score below -2.5 at any skeletal site; or men with T-scores below -3.5 or even below -3 if they have other risk factors for fracture. Adding an established osteoporosis therapy to testosterone should also be considered in hypogonadal men whose BMD T-score is &lt;-2.5 even after receiving adequate testosterone replacement therapy for two years. The latter suggestion is based upon clinical trial data in men showing that testosterone continues to improve BMD for at least two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Fracture risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2008, a World Health Organization (WHO) task force introduced <a href=\"http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/&amp;token=Is0F5/ImQqBopGKrWR2x/MCmpmhgzdFRoihp7Vybx7uk/lvW7TmyNtcbx4DNfIl6&amp;TOPIC_ID=2059\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FRAX</a>, which estimates the 10-year probability of hip fracture or major osteoporotic fractures combined (hip, spine, shoulder, or wrist) for an untreated patient using femoral neck BMD <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span> and easily obtainable clinical risk factors for fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76445 \">table 2</a>). BMD from non-hip sites has not been validated and is therefore not recommended for use in the algorithm. The technical aspects of FRAX are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;, section on 'Fracture risk assessment tool'</a>.)</p><p>The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) released revised osteoporosis treatment and prevention guidelines based upon the fracture prediction algorithm (FRAX) in conjunction with an updated United States-specific economic analysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52512\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52512 \">table 1</a>). The guidelines provide treatment recommendations for postmenopausal women and men age 50 and older. Guidelines from the Endocrine Society for the management of osteoporosis in men are similarly based upon the WHO fracture prediction algorithm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>These guidelines recommend treatment of men &ge;50 years with a history of hip or vertebral fracture or with osteoporosis based upon BMD measurement (T-score &le;-2.5). These recommendations are widely accepted, and clinical trial data support the use of bisphosphonates to prevent fracture in such individuals. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Bisphosphonates'</a> below.)</p><p>The guidelines also provide treatment recommendations for men with osteopenia on BMD (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5). In these individuals, the model suggests that treatment is cost effective when the 10-year probability of hip fracture reaches 3 percent or the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures combined is &ge;20 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52512\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52512 \">table 1</a>). These criteria were chosen on the basis of a United States-specific economic analysis, and they have not been assessed in clinical trials.</p><p>Intervention thresholds have been estimated for other countries based upon assessment of absolute fracture risk and country-specific analyses. The 2010 Osteoporosis Canada guidelines recommend pharmacologic therapy to patients at high absolute risk (&gt;20 percent probability for major osteoporotic fracture over 10 years) and to individuals over age 50 who have a fragility fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For those at moderate risk (10 to 20 percent), the decision to treat should be based upon the presence of additional risk factors not considered in the risk assessment system and upon individual preference.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, pharmacologic treatment was cost effective at all ages when the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture exceeded 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The United Kingdom National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommends an age-dependent intervention threshold, which ranges from 7.5 to 30 percent for ages 50 to 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, these guidelines should not be applied to individuals living in different countries, as the guidelines are based upon a United States-specific economic analysis. Intervention thresholds have been estimated for other countries and country-specific guidelines are available or are in development.

In an analysis of data from a population-based cohort of 5880 older men (mean age 73.6 years), the proportion of men identified for osteoporosis treatment varied from 2.2 to 25.3 percent, depending upon the different criteria used to assess osteoporosis and risk for fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Use of the BMD criteria proposed by the WHO (femoral neck T-score &le;-2.5 derived from female reference database) identified the fewest men for osteoporosis treatment, whereas use of the FRAX intervention thresholds set by the NOF for men with BMD T-scores between -1 and -2.5 identified the most men for treatment (25.3 percent). During the 10-year follow-up period, 177 (3 percent) men had a hip fracture. The observed 10-year fracture probabilities were highest among the men identified as having osteoporosis by the WHO BMD criteria (20.6 versus 9.5 percent using FRAX thresholds set by the NOF).</p><p>The FRAX intervention thresholds as proposed by the NOF increase the proportion of older men who are candidates for therapy, whereas restricting treatment only to men who meet the WHO BMD criteria reduces the total number of men treated but may exclude some men who might benefit from treatment. Even with the FRAX-NOF thresholds, some high-risk patients, such as men receiving high-dose glucocorticoids, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, or who have undergone organ transplantation, should often be treated even if they fail to meet the criteria listed above. Thus, although these guidelines are useful, osteoporosis treatment should remain individualized through shared decision making between patient and clinician.</p><p>The diagnosis of osteoporosis, including debate about the use of sex-specific normative databases for the calculation of a T-scores in men, is reviewed separately.

In the absence of high-quality, head-to-head drug comparison trials to determine the relative efficacy of the individual drugs, choice of therapy should be based upon efficacy, safety, cost, convenience, and other patient-related factors. Bisphosphonates are considered the treatment of choice for most men with osteoporosis requiring pharmacologic therapy. We and others suggest weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> as initial therapy for most men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men/abstract/2,18,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18,23,24</a>].
