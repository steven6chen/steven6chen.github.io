The following observations have been made regarding their efficacy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared to placebo, both are more effective in maintaining sinus rhythm at six months and in prolonging the time to atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-trials/abstract/18-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flecainide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a> appear to have equal efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-trials/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In a randomized, open-label study of 200 patients, for example, the probability of a safe and effective response (maintenance of sinus rhythm or fewer episodes of paroxysmal AF) at one year was 77 and 75 percent with flecainide and propafenone, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-trials/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis evaluated trials of patients with AF resistant to class I drugs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> after cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-trials/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The concern about the use of the class IC agents is primarily the result of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), which showed that flecainide increased the number of deaths among patients with drug-suppressible ventricular premature beats in the year following a myocardial infarction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59975\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59975 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-trials/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

One approach to managing this situation has been a &ldquo;hybrid approach&rdquo; that involves ablation of atrial flutter by creating a block across the cavotricuspid isthmus and then continuation of the antiarrhythmic drug. Although this approach may be helpful in maintaining sinus rhythm in the short term, data (articles below) suggest that in the long term, there is a high recurrence of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-trials/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Therefore, the development of atrial flutter on an antiarrhythmic drug may be considered failure of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations for the use drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation: Recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following are the important points made in this topic:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main goal of drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm is to reduce symptoms by decreasing the frequency and duration of episodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary endpoint of many clinical trials involving antiarrhythmic drugs has been time to first recurrence of AF. However, there is great variation in efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs from patient to patient. Although a drug may be shown to significantly prolong the time to recurrence of AF in a clinical trial, some patients will experience no benefit and others will experience a dramatic reduction in AF frequency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other outcomes are also important. These include the effect of the drug on overall AF burden, AF episode duration, symptoms, ventricular rate control, and hospitalizations. A single recurrence of AF on a drug does not necessarily indicate treatment failure or require a change in therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the rhythm control strategy is chosen, the recommended drugs for maintenance of sinus rhythm vary with the clinical setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78424 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83173\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef83173 \">algorithm 1</a>). Optimal antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be both effective and have a low incidence of toxicity, including proarrhythmia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a> are effective in the maintenance of sinus rhythm. Of these, amiodarone is the most effective, but is associated with the development of more frequent side effects. Dronedarone is also associated with the development of significant side effects as well as worse outcomes in some groups of patients with AF.
