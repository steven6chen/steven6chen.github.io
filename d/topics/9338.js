Hypovolemia typically reduces tissue perfusion. However, tissue edema can also reduce tissue perfusion (eg, excessive volume administration or compensatory fluid retention in a patient with severe myocardial dysfunction).</p><p>Intraoperative monitoring with standard hemodynamic measurements (eg, noninvasive blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]) and in selected cases, with one or more invasive monitors of dynamic hemodynamic parameters, can be used to predict fluid responsiveness (ie, increase in cardiac output following intravenous fluid administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F86275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86275 \">figure 1</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Laboratory values may be obtained, but these do not immediately reflect acute changes in volume status. Other clinical methods routinely used to assess volume status in the awake state are not available in the anesthetized patient (eg, thirst, postural dizziness, lethargy, confusion). </p><p>Regardless of the monitors employed, intraoperative determination of intravascular volume status is challenging because of continuously changing cardiovascular responses to anesthetic drugs, variable surgical volume losses that are difficult to quantify, and a preoperative volume status that may be suboptimal or unknown. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1307207319\"><span class=\"h2\">Static (traditional) parameters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Static parameters (eg, measurements of BP, HR, urine output [UO], and central venous pressure [CVP]) have been traditionally used to provide supplemental data regarding intravascular volume status (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-during-anesthesia#H1289396269\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring during anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Monitoring modalities'</a>). However, sole use of these parameters to guide fluid therapy may result in either hypovolemia or hypervolemia, and significant intraoperative reduction in tissue perfusion may not be recognized even with continuous monitoring of these static parameters due to the following limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/9,10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,18</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood pressure and heart rate</strong> &ndash; BP and HR responses to changes in intravascular volume status are not predictable in individual patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For example, a healthy young patient with a subclinical hypovolemic state often has normal BP and HR because the stress response to surgery activates the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, with release of vasoconstrictor hormones that increase BP. Although the resulting peripheral vasoconstriction favors maintenance of adequate perfusion to the heart and the brain, perfusion to other organs such as the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and skin may be reduced. Furthermore, general or neuraxial anesthesia may blunt these compensatory vasoconstrictive responses to decreased perfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another example is a patient treated with beta-blockers who may not manifest tachycardia in response to hypovolemia.

However, in patients undergoing anesthesia and surgery, oliguria alone is not a sufficient indication for fluid administration. Inhalation anesthetics, as well as surgical stress, may reduce UO. If the patient is actually euvolemic, administration of fluid to treat oliguria may lead to fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Traditional thresholds for intraoperative oliguria do not predict acute kidney injury (AKI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 trials conducted in surgical and critically ill patients, less renal dysfunction was noted in patients receiving goal-directed fluid therapy without use of oliguria to guide fluid administration compared with patients who received conventional fluid management that targeted oliguria reversal (odds ratio [OR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.34-0.61) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Different thresholds for UO were examined in a large retrospective study of 3560 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Intraoperative UO &lt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour was associated with increased risk for AKI (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.77-3.97) compared with UO 0.3 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour or higher. Taken together, these data suggest that traditional targets that attempt to maintain UO &gt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour are not warranted, but oliguria &lt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour may be associated with increased risk of renal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mixed venous oxygen saturation </strong>&ndash; Measurements intended to track global oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) delivery have limited utility to guide fluid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

These include differing definitions for GDT, lack of well-defined endpoints, different types of fluid therapy, different devices used to monitor dynamic hemodynamic parameters, variations in management of the control group, and small sample sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/10,53,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,53,113</a>]. In addition, most studies included only limited information regarding anesthetic techniques and surgical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. </p><p>Whether GDT is superior to a restrictive fluid strategy is less certain. One randomized trial that included 150 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery noted that cardiac output-guided GDT to optimize SV offered no significant benefit or difference in outcomes compared with a restrictive fluid therapy approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. GDT does not appear to offer additional benefits over a restrictive fluid approach for patients managed with protocols to achieve enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/115-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">115-118</a>]. The likely reason is that ERAS protocols implement multiple processes that each reduce the risk of perioperative fluid imbalances (eg, avoidance of preoperative dehydration, use of an intraoperative restrictive fluid approach, emphasis on early postoperative alimentation and ambulation). One meta-analysis assessing GDT in this setting found no benefit (or harm) with its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthetic-management-for-enhanced-recovery-after-major-surgery-eras-in-adults#H244926194\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthetic management for enhanced recovery after major surgery (ERAS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Fluid management'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical questions regarding GDT that remain unanswered include which types of patients are most likely to benefit, timing of the use of GDT (preoperative, intraoperative, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postoperative), which outcome measures or endpoints are optimal, which combinations of therapies constitute the best approach (eg, fluids with or without vasopressors or inotropic agents), and how long the regimen should be maintained during the postoperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3041008465\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid traditional liberal or fixed-volume approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not use traditional liberal or fixed-volume approaches to fluid therapy in patients undergoing any type of surgery, because these strategies result in administration of a large volume of crystalloid solution, with increased incidence or severity of tissue edema and associated adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/9,10,12,18,48,49,90-93,119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,12,18,48,49,90-93,119,120</a>].</p><p>Traditional fixed-volume approaches were based upon predetermined calculations that included administration of fluid to account for presumed preoperative deficits, as well as intraoperative blood and urinary losses. In addition, fluid was typically administered to compensate for calculated non-anatomic &quot;third space&quot; fluid losses during the surgical procedure. This practice is inappropriate, as it has been well-established that such third space losses do not exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/4,98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,98,99</a>]. Furthermore, fixed volume regimens specified replacement of initial blood loss with crystalloid volume that was three times the amount of lost blood. For example, if blood loss was estimated to be 500 to 1000 mL, then 1500 to 3000 mL of crystalloid was typically administered. This calculation is not supported by available data. Rather, optimal volume ratios to compensate for lost blood are estimated to be 1.5:1.0 for crystalloid and 1.0:1.0 for colloid, as discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96</a>] (see <a href=\"#H4057778\" class=\"local\">'Crystalloid solutions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H334047574\" class=\"local\">'Colloid solutions'</a> above). Similarly, large volumes of fluid are unnecessary as preloading before a neuraxial block. </p><p>The overall result of use of traditional fixed volume calculations was administration of a large total volume of crystalloid solution and a high likelihood of increased perioperative tissue edema. For these reasons, such approaches have been abandoned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1058523279\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of tissue perfusion by maintaining euvolemia is the goal for intraoperative monitoring of intravascular fluid volume and administration of intraoperative fluid therapy. Both hypovolemia and hypervolemia are associated with postoperative morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H1351216045\" class=\"local\">'Consequences of intravascular volume derangements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absolute or relative hypovolemia is common in the perioperative period due to preoperative dehydration, vasodilation caused by anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and surgical bleeding. The most common cause of perioperative tissue edema is retention of fluid administered during surgery. (See <a href=\"#H254314205\" class=\"local\">'Causes of intravascular volume derangements'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While physiological parameters such as blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), and urine output (UO) are monitored during surgery, significant intraoperative reduction in tissue perfusion may not be recognized even with continuous monitoring of these static parameters. (See <a href=\"#H1307207319\" class=\"local\">'Static (traditional) parameters'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring of dynamic hemodynamic parameters based on respiratory variation uses the intra-arterial waveform tracing for automated analysis or visually estimated or manually calculated pulse pressure variations (PPV) or systolic pressure variations (SPV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F86275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86275 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F85848\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85848 \">figure 2</a>), or estimates of stroke volume (SV) in order to determine responses to fluid boluses (typically administered in 250 mL increments). An alternative is use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to recognize hypovolemic and hypervolemic states by visual qualitative assessment or quantitative measurements of left ventricular (LV) cavity size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104149\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104149 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109236\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109236 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104503\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef104503 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106967\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106967 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H254311286\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic hemodynamic parameters'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the use of balanced electrolyte solutions (eg, Ringer's lactate, Plasmalyte), rather than normal saline or colloid as the standard intravenous fluid to maintain or replace intravascular volume in surgical patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We typically select a balanced crystalloid solution to be administered at 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour to replace sensible and insensible losses, and for fluid boluses (typically 250 mL) to optimize intravascular volume. (See <a href=\"#H334047574\" class=\"local\">'Colloid solutions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4057778\" class=\"local\">'Crystalloid solutions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We replace initial blood loss with either crystalloid administered in a volume that is 1.5 times the amount of lost blood, or colloid administered on a 1.0:1.0 volume basis, until a transfusion threshold is met. (See <a href=\"#H1058523188\" class=\"local\">'Choosing fluid: Crystalloid, colloid, or blood'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most adult patients undergoing minimally or moderately invasive surgical procedures with planned early postoperative ambulation, we administer 1 to 2 L of a balanced electrolyte solution to provide adequate intravascular hydration. (See <a href=\"#H2312279859\" class=\"local\">'Minimally/moderately invasive surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For major invasive surgical procedures, we suggest a restrictive (zero-balance) or goal-directed therapy (GDT) approach to fluid therapy, rather than traditional liberal or fixed-volume approaches (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We choose between these strategies based on anticipated significant blood loss (eg, &gt;500 mL) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other significant perioperative fluid shifts. Both the restrictive and GDT strategies appear to be associated with reduced morbidity compared with more liberal fluid administration. (See <a href=\"#H3439693921\" class=\"local\">'Major invasive surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A restrictive (zero-balance) approach to fluid therapy replaces only fluid lost during the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H2410959413\" class=\"local\">'Restrictive (zero-balance) strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A GDT approach to fluid therapy requires invasive monitoring of dynamic hemodynamic parameters (ie, intra-arterial catheter). (See <a href=\"#H626508222\" class=\"local\">'Goal-directed fluid therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H254311286\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic hemodynamic parameters'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients, we use visually estimated SPV in the intra-arterial waveform tracing to determine responsiveness to fluid boluses (typically 250 mL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F86275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86275 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For high-risk patients undergoing a surgical procedure with expected blood loss &gt;1000 mL, significant nonhemorrhagic fluid shifts, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> likely prolonged duration, we typically select a commercially available device to determine responses to fluid challenges (eg, devices that provide automated calculations of respiratory variations in systolic BP, pulse pressure, or SV in the intra-arterial waveform tracing, esophageal Doppler device to estimate SV, TEE to assess LV cavity size).</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraoperative-fluid-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Jacob M, Chappell D, Conzen P, et al.
