Complete remissions from systemic chemotherapy are uncommon, and only a fraction of complete responders remain progression free for a prolonged period. The median survival for patients with stage IV breast cancer is 18 to 24 months, although the range extends from only a few months to many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although systemic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for metastatic breast cancer, local management of the primary as well as metastasis-specific local treatment (ie, metastasectomy, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, and radiation therapy) may palliate symptoms and prevent cancer-related complications. Some evidence suggests a potential for prolonging survival, although prospective data are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These approaches and their rationale are discussed here.</p><p>Systemic medical therapy for metastatic breast cancer, consisting of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biologic therapies, and supportive care is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H496392973\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF THE PRIMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary role of local treatment to the breast in metastatic breast cancer is palliation. Patients with metastatic disease should be evaluated for possible local management of the primary if it may control local complications from the cancer (eg, bleeding, infection, or wound management). However, in general, for patients who are asymptomatic at the site of their primary, we do not offer local treatment given lack of clear evidence that it improves survival. While retrospective evidence suggests a possible benefit, prospective data have shown no overall survival benefit or only minimal survival benefit, and are limited by methodologic issues. As such, we typically do not offer surgery in such cases.</p><p>Deviations to this approach may be rarely made on a case-by-case basis in a multidisciplinary setting, although these instances are exceptional. For example, we have offered local management of the primary to patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease who have a brisk and dramatic response to systemic therapy. However, data supporting such an approach are lacking, and the decision to proceed with local management in a similar situation should take into account the expertise and experience of the treating institution as well as patient preferences. If lumpectomy is pursued for local management of the primary, radiation therapy (RT) is not indicated, as it would be for primary curative treatment for non-metastatic disease. Similarly, if mastectomy is used, reconstruction should not be offered (unless necessary to close a large wound).</p><p>Prospective studies evaluating the effect of surgical resection of the primary lesion have yielded somewhat mixed results, possibly because of differences in the patient populations evaluated. In a trial from India, 350 women with de-novo metastatic breast cancer who achieved a partial or complete response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to surgery (mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery [BCS]) and standard postoperative radiation versus no locoregional treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There was no difference between the two groups in regards to overall survival (19.2 versus 20.5 months in the control group, hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% CI 0.81-1.34). Locoregional treatment resulted in improvement in locoregional progression-free survival (median not attained&nbsp;versus 18.2 months; HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.10-0.26) but worsened distant progression-free survival (11.3 versus 19.8 months in the control group; HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08-1.85). In this study, endocrine therapy and HER2-directed therapy were permitted when clinically appropriate; however, most eligible women did not receive these treatments. It is unclear whether locoregional therapy would have improved survival in these women if these systemic treatments had been administered. In a separate United States (US) registry study in which 94 women who responded to first-line therapy were randomly assigned to local management of the primary or not, preliminary data suggest no difference in overall survival between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>By contrast, in a Turkish trial in which patients who presented with metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned at diagnosis to surgery or not, a benefit was observed with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This design differs from the studies above in which patients were only included if they had experienced a response to systemic therapy. In preliminary presentation of this trial, 274 women with de-novo metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to local management (mastectomy, or BCS with radiation) followed by systemic therapy versus systemic therapy only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While there was no difference in three-year survival, patients treated with local management experienced an improvement in five-year survival with locoregional treatment (46.4 versus 26.4 percent; HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.88). Patients in the surgical group had lower rates of triple-negative disease (7 versus 17 percent) and visceral metastases (29 versus 45 percent), and were more likely to have solitary bone metastases only (33 versus 20 percent), raising the concern that the patients receiving surgery fell into a better prognostic category before the intervention. In a post-hoc subgroup analysis, patients with hormone-positive, HER2-negative disease; those younger than 55 years; and those with solitary bone metastases appeared to derive the greatest benefit from local management.</p><p>Previous retrospective studies have also suggested that women who undergo resection of the primary breast cancer have improved survival with removal of the primary tumor, though are likely limited in interpretation due to selection bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/8-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-21</a>]. For example, in a meta-analysis of 10 studies that included 28,693 women presenting with stage IV breast cancer, women undergoing a resection of the primary breast cancer were more likely to survive three years compared with women not undergoing a primary cancer resection (40 versus 22 percent; odds ratio [OR] 2.32, 95% CI 2.08-2.60, p &lt;0.01). However, women undergoing surgical resection were more likely to have smaller tumors and less extensive metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], raising the possibility of selection bias in this study (ie, patents perceived to have a longer potential for survival are more likely to be offered breast surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. In another review of 19,464 patients with breast cancer, matched pair analysis showed that the survival benefit associated with primary-site surgery in stage IV disease was limited to those patients who received chemotherapy initially rather than surgery followed by chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This suggests that patients who have a good response to initial chemotherapy are selected to proceed to surgery, arguing again for selection bias.</p><p>Given these conflicting results, we await data from trials such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E2108, which evaluates overall survival as well as quality of life and the incidence of uncontrolled chest wall disease among those with metastatic breast cancer undergoing local management of the primary (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01242800&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPPwoW+bEJfzUWoHPrtlcCCG0mV3gqJ8m7lPdhDUh1sGzA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=760\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT01242800</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36512206\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF METASTASES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2618087954\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who present with symptomatic metastases, eg, intractable pain, loss of function, or an oncologic emergency (eg, cord compression, mass effect due to brain metastases, pathologic fracture due to a bony metastasis), are appropriate candidates for urgent local intervention to relieve symptoms and preserve patient ability to function. The objective of this treatment is palliative to relieve symptoms and to stabilize the patient rather than to prolong survival outcomes.</p><p>Additionally, for patients with a first presentation of metastatic disease, biopsy of the metastatic site should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and reestablish receptor status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles#H1577314249\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;, section on 'Role of repeat biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>For patients who lack symptomatic metastases, systemic therapy without surgical intervention is usually the most appropriate treatment. While retrospective data suggest a survival benefit for aggressive local therapy in patients with oligometastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/4,17,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17,23,24</a>], selection bias may have played a role in these studies. Prospective data are not available.</p><p>In the absence of conclusive data, some UpToDate experts use systemic treatment alone for asymptomatic patients; others adopt an individualized approach to the asymptomatic patient, offering local management to those with multiple good prognostic factors, although this is not considered standard of care at this time:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Good performance status</strong> &ndash; The most important issues in choosing patients for local treatment of metastatic disease are the performance status and an estimation of the relative risks of a planned operation.

When metastatic breast cancer is confined to the bones, the natural history is usually characterized by an indolent course and good response to systemic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. One UpToDate expert views a solitary sternal metastasis as a possible exception, given that sternal metastases may remain solitary for a long time and may represent a locoregional recurrence rather than true metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

Such patients are likely to have a good prognosis regardless of whether they undergo surgery, so other UpToDate experts prefer to treat with systemic therapy only in the absence of urgent or palliative indication. (See <a href=\"#H2618087954\" class=\"local\">'Selection of patients'</a> above.)</p><p>An essential part of the diagnostic work-up in patients who are considered for hepatectomy is precise imaging of the liver (helical computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging) to evaluate whether a complete resection can be achieved while retaining a sufficient volume of functional liver. It is not clear that multiple metastases are a negative prognostic feature for resection of liver metastases, as long as they can be completely resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/27,28,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,33</a>]. Bilobar disease and location close to the porta hepatis are typically considered a contraindication to resection. Initial laparoscopic exploration may spare unresectable patients the morbidity of a laparotomy, since up to one-half of patients considered for resection are discovered to have diffuse liver lesions or peritoneal dissemination at the time of laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Hepatic resection and SBRT are the most frequently employed methods. The selection of SBRT versus surgery depends on which one will result in the highest probability of preserving liver function. For larger (&gt;5 cm) peripheral lesions, surgery can sometimes preserve more functional liver than SBRT. By contrast, for central lesions, SBRT may be preferred.</p><p>The data to support local therapy come from a systematic retrospective review of 19 studies involving 535 patients who underwent hepatectomy for metastatic breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Hepatectomy was undertaken in patients with mostly solitary lesions or with a median of two lesions (range, one to four). The median overall survival was 40 months (range, 23 to 77 months) with a five-year survival following resection of 40 percent (range, 21 to 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Postoperative mortality ranged from 0 to 6 percent, and the complication rate ranged from 0 to 44 percent. Poor prognostic factors following hepatic resection include positive margins and hormone-refractory disease. In a subsequent case-control study of 167 patients, 69 of whom received surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ablation and 98 of whom were treated medically, overall survival between the two groups was not significantly different (50 versus 45 months in the local treatment versus medical treatment groups, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Local treatment was associated with a recurrence-free interval of 28.5 months. Those receiving local treatment had lower-risk disease, with a higher frequency of estrogen receptor (ER) positivity, lower median number of liver metastases, and a longer interval between breast cancer diagnosis and presentation with a solitary liver metastasis (53 versus 30 months). These results suggest that among patients with low-risk disease, local treatment might provide a significant period of disease-free survival, while allowing for time off of systemic chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatic-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatic resection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-resection-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic resection techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While there are only low-quality data to support the use of RFA in patients with metastatic breast cancer, it may be used in select patients alone or in combination with resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/37,54-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,54-58</a>], particularly in solitary hepatic lesions smaller than 3 cm in diameter. One series involved 45 patients who underwent an RFA for metastatic disease (mean size, 2.3 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Of these, 90 percent had a complete ablation. However, approximately 20 percent had relapsed at eight months. Three-year overall survival was 44 percent in this series. In addition, these results suggested that RFA was most effective in smaller lesions &lt;3 cm in size.</p><p>Although we do not suggest their routine use based on available data, alternative local therapies are being explored to treat liver metastases, including selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), percutaneous ethanol injection, cryotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, transhepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and interstitial laser therapy. In general, there are fewer data regarding the use of these techniques for metastatic breast cancer than there are for patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases or primary hepatocellular cancer. Furthermore, none of these methods has been directly compared with systemic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H987218206\"><span class=\"h3\">Ovaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the ovaries are a rare site for metastases from breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>], limited data suggest ovarian breast cancer metastases can appear many years following the initial diagnosis of breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>]. Surgical evaluation of an adnexal mass may be required to discriminate metastatic breast cancer from a primary ovarian cancer. Furthermore, for the premenopausal women with hormone-positive breast cancer, oophorectomy can provide a therapeutic effect, regardless of whether metastatic disease to the ovaries is present or not. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-approach-to-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-her2-negative-breast-cancer-endocrine-therapy-and-targeted-agents#H3036297027\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment approach to metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: Endocrine therapy and targeted agents&quot;, section on 'ET for premenopausal women'</a>.)</p><p>Other indications for local management of ovarian metastases may include pain or bleeding that is refractory to medical therapy, although in practice this presentation is rare.</p><p>Data are limited in regards to local management of ovarian metastases from breast cancer. In one series of 147 patients with metastatic disease to the ovary (8 percent of whom had a breast primary), the median overall survival after ovarian metastasectomy was 41 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. For the entire series, massive intraoperative ascites, multiple metastases, and locally invasive disease were independent factors for a poorer overall survival.
