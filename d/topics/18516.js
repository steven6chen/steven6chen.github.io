In the United States, for example, the number of persons aged 80 years or older is expected to increase from 6.9 million in 1990 to approximately 25 million by the year 2050 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, degenerative valve disease is likely to become an increasing problem. Furthermore, the prevalence of valvular disease is increasing with age, with more than one in eight people age 75 and older having moderate or severe valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Fortunately, there have been major advances in cardiac surgery, which affect the consideration of surgical treatment in elderly patients who in the past may not have been surgical candidates. Among patients who survive the surgery and perioperative period, the level of function and quality of life and, in some studies, survival are the same as in a general population of age-matched subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. As a result, the classic view that surgery should be considered only for elderly patients in excellent general condition is being challenged as higher success rates are obtained in patients with comorbidities that are not serious or, if uncontrolled, not overwhelming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Additionally, development of percutaneous valvular interventions will further increase therapeutic choices for elderly adults. Indeed, the success of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has spurred active development efforts for mitral and tricuspid valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-therapy-for-symptomatic-severe-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of therapy for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies have used various age criteria to identify elderly adults. Although there are no comprehensive population-based data regarding the prevalence of valvular heart disease, several studies have provided important information about the prevalence of significant valvular heart disease, stratified by age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77504 \">table 1</a>). Aortic stenosis, organic and ischemic (functional) mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation are the most common valvular disorders in elderly adults. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AORTIC STENOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcific or degenerative aortic valve disease is a common valvular lesion encountered among elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In the Helsinki Aging Study, 501 randomly selected men and women aged 75 to 86 underwent imaging and Doppler echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The prevalence of at least moderate aortic stenosis, defined as an aortic valve area (AVA) &le;1.2 cm<sup>2</sup> and velocity ratio &le;0.35, was 5 percent; the prevalence of critical aortic stenosis (AVA &le;0.8 cm<sup>2</sup>, and velocity ratio &le;0.25) increased with age from 1 to 2 percent in persons 75 to 76 years of age up to almost 6 percent in those 86 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Moderate or severe aortic stenosis was more frequent in women (8.8 versus 3.6 percent in men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aortic valve area in aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similar prevalence has been reported from referral centers and nursing home populations, with an even higher prevalence in those over 90 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>The two most common causes of aortic stenosis severe enough to require surgery are calcification of congenital bicuspid aortic valves and degenerative calcification of tricuspid aortic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The relative distribution is importantly influenced by age, as illustrated in a study of 932 adults with isolated nonrheumatic aortic stenosis who underwent operative excision of the valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among patients over age 70, approximately 60 percent had a tricuspid valve and 40 percent had a bicuspid valve. In contrast, among patients between the ages of 50 and 70, approximately two-thirds had a bicuspid valve, one-third a tricuspid valve, and rare patients had a unicuspid valve. </p><p>Aortic stenosis in elderly patients may be accompanied by aortic regurgitation. In comparison, isolated aortic regurgitation due to aortic valve disease is uncommon in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

As an example, the Cardiovascular Health Study evaluated 5201 subjects &ge;65 years of age; the incidence of aortic sclerosis and aortic stenosis was 26 and 2 percent overall and 37 and 2.6 percent among those more than 75 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The prevalence is higher in older subjects: 35 percent between 75 and 84 years of age, and 48 percent of those aged 85 years and above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It is usually detected on echocardiography requested for other indications, although some patients have a midsystolic ejection murmur.</p><p>Aortic valve sclerosis is clinically important because it can progress to aortic stenosis and it is a marker for increased cardiovascular risk. Issues related to aortic valve sclerosis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aortic valve sclerosis and pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13898611\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of aortic stenosis in the elderly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic stenosis is staged based upon valve anatomy, valve hemodynamics, and hemodynamic (left ventricular) effects as presented in the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This staging system included the syndrome of symptomatic severe low gradient aortic stenosis. This entity is particularly prevalent in the elderly, and presents a diagnostic challenge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-low-gradient-severe-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient severe aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) is being performed more frequently in elderly patients at almost any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and approximately 60 to 70 percent of all valve surgery performed in elderly adults is for aortic stenosis. The indications for surgery are similar to those for younger patients: severe aortic stenosis with symptoms (angina, dyspnea, or syncope), a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50 percent, or concurrent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98005\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98005 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for valve replacement in aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Elderly patients with aortic stenosis tend to have a poorer preoperative status than younger patients. This leads to higher in-hospital mortality in older patients, which ranges from 5 to 18 percent in various studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/3,7,21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,21-26</a>]. Among elderly adults, age is an important determinant of outcome. In one series, for example, patients &ge;80 years of age had higher perioperative mortality than those 65 to 75 years of age (14 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At least part of this difference was due to a much higher frequency of New York Heart Association functional class III or IV in the older group (86 versus 36 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 3</a>). More trials show, in general, lower perioperative mortality (6.4 percent in Partner Cohort A patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Another factor related to the poorer outcome is extensive age-related valvular calcification, which is associated with friable tissues. This makes valve surgery particularly difficult in elderly adults, with a high risk of complications.</p><p>Patients undergoing aortic valve replacement generally have increased mortality if concurrent CABG is also performed. Mortality is also increased when aortic valve replacement is combined with procedures other than CABG (eg, mitral valve replacement or valve repair or aneurysm repair) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Coronary heart disease'</a> below)</p><p>Elderly patients who survive the perioperative period often do well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/3,21,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21,25-27</a>]. This was illustrated in a retrospective review that evaluated the outcome after aortic valve replacement in 1100 patients &ge;80 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The 30-day cardiac and all-cause mortalities were 4 and 6.6 percent, respectively, while the actuarial survival at one, five, and eight years was 89, 69, and 46 percent, respectively. After the first 30 postoperative days, 70 percent of deaths were due to noncardiac causes (most often malignancy, stroke, or pneumonia).</p><p>Older patients have excellent functional recovery and a marked improvement in quality of life, similar to what is observed in younger patients; their level of function and quality of life are the same as a general population of age-matched subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of aortic valve prosthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of prosthesis (bioprosthesis versus mechanical valve) is an important issue in aortic valve disease. The major problems with mechanical valves are thromboembolism and bleeding from chronic anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], while the major problem with bioprosthetic valves is their limited durability due to valve degeneration, although bioprosthetic valve thrombosis is now increasingly recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for valve replacement in aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early mortality and actuarial survival in elderly adults are similar with the two types of valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, the longevity of a bioprosthetic valve is inversely related to age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. In one report, the actuarial estimate of the rate of structural deterioration of bioprosthetic aortic valves at 15 years varied from 63 percent between the ages of 40 and 49 (and perhaps higher under age 40) to 10 percent over age 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similar findings were noted in a Veterans&rsquo; Affairs trial in which the rate of bioprosthetic valve failure at 15 years varied from 26 percent under age 65 to 9 percent in patients &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The lower rate of valve failure in elderly adults is due at least in part to decreased activity in older patients. </p><p>The net effect is that the life expectancy of an octogenarian is shorter than the expected functional life of a bioprosthesis. As a result, a bioprosthetic valve is usually the best choice in elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/21,25,31,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25,31,33,34</a>]. In the review cited above of aortic valve replacement in 1100 patients &ge;80 years of age, a bioprosthetic valve was implanted in 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A similar frequency of bioprosthetic valve use (81 percent) was reported in a series of 2447 patients &ge;65 years of age who underwent aortic valve replacement between 1992 and 2004 at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Over the last years, there was a strong increase in the use of bioprosthetic valves. Indeed, bioprostheses made up 53.3 percent of an estimated 767,375 prosthetic valves implanted in the United States between 1998 and 2011, increasing from 37.7 percent between 1998 and 2001 to 63.6 percent between 2007 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. For the entire period, bioprostheses were used in 65 percent of patients over the age of 75. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Small aortic annulus and prosthesis-patient mismatch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older patients, particularly elderly women, tend to have a small aortic annulus; this has led to use of a small aortic prosthesis, which may leave a marked residual transprosthetic gradient, ie, a patient-prosthesis mismatch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. This mismatch may be associated with worse hemodynamics, less functional improvement, and higher in-hospital mortality, particularly in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/37,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39,40</a>]. Long-term outcome in patients with patient prosthesis mismatch remain controversial; however, most of the studies have found that early and late mortality and sudden death risk are greater when mismatch is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/39,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41-43</a>]. </p><p>The impact of mismatch may vary among patients. A study found the mismatch has a negative impact in young patients &lt;70 years, but not in older patients; and in patients with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (&lt;50 percent), but not in those with preserved LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Obese patients (body mass index [BMI] <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;30kg/m&sup2;)</span> with mismatch had similar survival as compared to those with a BMI &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m&sup2;,</span> suggesting that using body surface area (BSA) to index aortic valve area is not the best way to define mismatch in obese patients undergoing AVR. Further studies using an alternative definition of mismatch are needed to evaluate long-term outcome in obese patients with AVR. </p><p>Some surgeons suggest that a mechanical valve may be preferred in patients with a small aortic annulus. Mechanical valves have smaller transvalvular gradients than bioprostheses and provide better hemodynamics, especially in patients with a small annulus (&lt;21 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The options with a bioprosthetic valve include accepting the higher residual gradient of a bioprosthesis, enlarging the aortic annulus, the use of a stentless bioprosthetic valve, or use of a transcatheter valve. Aortic root enlargement permits the use of a bioprosthesis one or two sizes larger. Although this may prevent a patient-prosthesis mismatch, it adds to the complexity of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Newer stentless bioprosthetic valves offer a larger orifice area with only a small transvalvular gradient so that enlargement of the annulus is infrequently required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. However, the durability of these stentless valves remains uncertain since long-term follow-up is not available. The incidence of severe patient-prosthesis mismatch is significantly lower with both balloon-expandable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] and self-expanding transcatheter valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Percutaneous balloon valvotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous balloon valvotomy was initially introduced as an alternative to aortic valve replacement in elderly patients with aortic stenosis. Early reports suggested elderly adults have limited benefit since the aortic valve is usually severely calcified without discernible commissural fusion, making it unsuitable for dilatation, and there has been a high incidence of residual or recurrent stenosis and serious complications, including death, stroke, aortic rupture, and aortic regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>As a result, balloon aortic valvotomy has traditionally been restricted to very high risk or inoperable patients. However, it can result in immediate improvement in hemodynamics and is palliative in patients with severe aortic stenosis who are inoperable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Patients who develop restenosis after aortic balloon valvotomy have undergone aortic valve replacement, with good long-term outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/51,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,54</a>]. Introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of aortic balloon valvuloplasty procedures, mainly due to increased referral of high-risk patients and to the emerging indication of bridge to TAVI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-elderly-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

While the MitraClip was inferior to surgical correction in terms of overall reduction of mitral regurgitation and need for re-intervention, this is a procedure that could be helpful in inoperable patients.

Elderly patients considered for valvular surgery are more likely to have aortic atherosclerosis. In such patients, any manipulation of the aorta during surgery, including aortic cannulation for arterial inflow during cardiopulmonary bypass or aortic cross-clamping, may fragment a plaque, resulting in embolization.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors associated with calcific aortic stenosis in elderly adults are similar to those for atherosclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for degenerative calcific aortic stenosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of aortic stenosis (AS) may be more complex in the elderly due to the prevalence of &ldquo;low-gradient severe AS&rdquo;. In such cases, quantification of aortic valve calcification by computed tomography may prove useful. (See <a href=\"#H13898611\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of aortic stenosis in the elderly'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elderly patients with AS tend to have poorer preoperative status and higher operative mortality with aortic valve replacement. However, those who survive the perioperative period often do well and have marked improvement in quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Outcome of surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When aortic valve replacement is indicated, a bioprosthetic valve is generally preferred to a mechanical valve in elderly patients in whom life expectancy is shorter than the expected function life of the bioprosthesis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Choice of aortic valve prosthesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is the main choice for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are considered inoperable for surgical aortic valve replacement, and is associated with lower rates of patient prosthesis mismatch. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common causes for chronic aortic regurgitation in elderly adults are dilation of the ascending aorta resulting from hypertension or primary aortic disease, calcific aortic sclerosis, and, rarely, a bicuspid aortic valve. Acute aortic regurgitation is most often due to an aortic dissection or endocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Aortic regurgitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In elderly adults, the most common causes of significant mitral regurgitation referred for mitral valve surgery are primary mitral valve disease and ischemic heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery for severe chronic mitral regurgitation may be recommended for young asymptomatic patients with or without early evidence of left ventricular dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98397 \">table 5</a>), but in patients over age 80, although early surgery can be discussed, it is often preferred to proceed with surgery when symptoms are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-intervention-for-severe-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for intervention for severe chronic primary mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral stenosis is relatively uncommon in elderly adults. The predominant cause is rheumatic fever. Calcific mitral stenosis due to protuberant annular calcification is occasionally seen. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Mitral stenosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis, percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is the procedure of choice if valvular morphology is favorable. However, it is not indicated in patients with mitral obstruction due to mitral annular calcification. Transcatheter mitral valve implantation is being investigated for calcific mitral stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary heart disease is common in elderly patients with valvular disease. When valve surgery is indicated in elderly patients, coronary angiography is indicated to assess the need for concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery.
