It is estimated that approximately 140,250 new cases of large bowel cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], including approximately 97,220 colon and 43,030 rectal cancers. Approximately 50,630 Americans are expected to die of large bowel cancer each year. Although CRC mortality has been progressively declining since 1990 at a rate of approximately 2.5 to 3 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], it still remains the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States in women, and the second leading cause of death in men. Global, country-specific incidence and mortality rates are available from the World Health Organization <a href=\"http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/Map.aspx&amp;token=0fC2KlWP2lBbCApZ6DyKw47MnQXaSNBIvsugca7gMSw+6djwprsRosUIl828CRp5&amp;TOPIC_ID=2496\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Globocan database</a>.</p><p>In contrast to these declines, the incidence of CRC in men and women under the age of 50 has been steadily increasing at a rate of 2.1 percent per year from 1992 through 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These increases are driven predominantly by left-sided cancers in general and rectal cancer in particular (3.9 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Current literature suggests that over 86 percent of those diagnosed under the age of 50 are symptomatic at diagnosis, and this is associated with more advanced stage at diagnosis and poorer outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. At present, screening is not recommended for individuals under the age of 50 unless they have inflammatory bowel disease, a history of abdominal radiation, a positive family history, or a predisposing inherited syndrome.

Screening of asymptomatic individuals for CRC is advocated by major societies and preventive care organizations. Screening has been shown to detect asymptomatic early-stage malignancy and improve mortality.

However, the specificity was &gt;95 percent for dark-red rectal bleeding and for the presence of a palpable abdominal mass on examination, indicating that patients without CRC rarely have these findings and suggesting that the presence of either makes the diagnosis of a CRC likely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The association between constipation and CRC was addressed in a meta-analysis of 28 cross-sectional surveys and cohort studies, which demonstrated no increase in the prevalence of CRC among individuals with constipation as the primary indication for colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A population-based case-control study of clinical features before the diagnosis of CRC conducted in 21 primary care practices in Exeter, Devon, in the United Kingdom included 349 patients over the age of 40 who were diagnosed with CRC over a four-year period and 1744 controls without CRC who were matched by age, sex, and general practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Primary care records for the two years before diagnosis were reviewed to ascertain symptoms. Of the 349 cases studied, 210 (60 percent) had tumors at or distal to the splenic flexure and 126 (36 percent) were proximal to it, with the remainder having multiple or unknown sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ten features were associated with CRC before diagnosis; in a univariate analysis, the likelihood ratios for CRC according to symptoms were rectal bleeding 10, weight loss 5.1, abdominal pain 4.5, diarrhea 3.9, constipation 1.8, abnormal rectal examination 18, abdominal tenderness 4.6, hemoglobin &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> 9.5, and positive fecal occult blood 31. The positive predictive values (PPVs) for abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, weight loss, and rectal bleeding were higher for older patients (70 and over), especially rectal bleeding. When symptoms were combined, the PPV was highest (&gt;10) for hemoglobin &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> combined with abdominal tenderness. The very high PPV for a positive fecal occult blood test validates the policy of prompt investigation of patients with positive fecal occult blood tests, particularly if symptomatic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-for-screening-for-colorectal-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests for screening for colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Stool-based tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the limitations to timely colonoscopy in many health care settings and the nonspecific nature of most colorectal (cancer) symptoms, there is emerging interest in using fecal immunochemical tests for occult blood (iFOBT) using a low threshold of fecal hemoglobin to maximize sensitivity in order to stratify symptomatic patients who need more urgent diagnostic colonoscopy. This approach is supported by a limited amount of data showing that a negative result on iFOBT has a high negative predictive value for ruling out CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, this approach is not in widespread use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another systematic review of 62 studies assessing the relationship between symptoms and CRC used estimates of sensitivity and specificity to calculate a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR = <span class=\"nowrap\">[sensitivity/(1-sensitivity)]/[(1-specificity)/specificity]),</span> which provided a single summary measure of accuracy for each symptom; a high DOR indicates a high correlation between the symptom and the disease, while a DOR of one means that the symptom presence is no better than chance in discriminating between diseased and nondiseased patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The DORs, sensitivity, likelihood ratio of having the disease if the symptom was present, and likelihood of having CRC in the absence of the symptom for a variety of symptoms are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F88734\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88734 \">table 1</a>). The authors concluded that only rectal bleeding and weight loss were associated with the presence of a CRC, and even these had relatively low DORs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may also present with <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> of metastatic disease. Approximately 20 percent of patients in the United States have distant metastatic disease at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. CRC can spread by lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination, as well as by contiguous and transperitoneal routes. The most common metastatic sites are the regional lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and peritoneum. Patients may present with signs or symptoms referable to any of these areas. The presence of right upper quadrant pain, abdominal distention, early satiety, supraclavicular adenopathy, or periumbilical nodules usually signals advanced, often metastatic disease.</p><p>Because the venous drainage of the intestinal tract is via the portal system, the first site of hematogenous dissemination is usually the liver, followed by the lungs, bone, and many other sites, including the brain. However, tumors arising in the distal rectum may metastasize initially to the lungs because the inferior rectal vein drains into the inferior vena cava rather than into the portal venous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Unusual presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of atypical presentations of CRC. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local invasion or a contained perforation causing malignant fistula formation into adjacent organs, such as bladder (resulting in pneumaturia) or small bowel. This is most common with cecal or sigmoid carcinomas; in the latter case, the condition can mimic diverticulitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever of unknown origin, intraabdominal, retroperitoneal, abdominal wall or intrahepatic abscesses due to a localized perforated colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Because of this, and because of the high frequency of synchronous CRCs, flexible sigmoidoscopy is generally not considered to be an adequate diagnostic study for a patient suspected of having a CRC, unless a palpable mass is felt in the rectum. In such cases, a full colonoscopy will still be needed to evaluate the remainder of the colon for synchronous polyps and cancers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>).

A review of the biopsy specimen is important prior to making a decision about the need for clinical staging studies and surgical resection, especially for a cancerous polyp. Polyps with an area of invasive malignancy that have been completely removed and lack associated adverse histologic features (positive margin, poor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion) have a low risk of lymphatic and distant metastases; in such patients, polypectomy alone may be adequate. This is more easily determined if the polyp is pedunculated.

Although frequently obtained preoperatively, liver enzymes may be normal in the setting of small hepatic metastases and are not a reliable marker for exclusion of liver involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81255\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81255 \">picture 3</a>). The single most common liver test abnormality associated with liver metastases is an elevation in the serum alkaline phosphatase level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">CT scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States and elsewhere, the standard practice at most institutions is that all patients with stage II, III, or IV CRC undergo chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT, either prior to or following resection, an approach endorsed by the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2496\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>. In general, it is preferable to&nbsp;obtain these scans prior to, rather than after surgery, as the scan results will occasionally change&nbsp;surgical planning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92849217\"><span class=\"h4\">Abdomen and pelvis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with newly-diagnosed CRC, preoperative abdominal and pelvic CT scans can demonstrate regional tumor extension, regional lymphatic and distant metastases, and tumor-related complications (eg, obstruction, perforation, fistula formation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>]. The sensitivity of CT for detecting distant metastasis is higher (75 to 87 percent) than for detecting nodal involvement (45 to 73 percent) or the depth of transmural invasion (approximately 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/82,84-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,84-89</a>]. The sensitivity of CT for detection of malignant lymph nodes is higher for rectal than for colon cancers; perirectal adenopathy is presumed to be malignant since benign adenopathy is typically not seen in this area in the absence of demonstrable inflammatory process (eg, proctitis, fistula, perirectal abscess) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>CT scan is not a reliable diagnostic test for low-volume tumor on peritoneal surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The sensitivity of CT for detecting peritoneal implants depends on the location and size of the implants. In one study, the sensitivity of CT for nodules &lt;0.5 cm was 11 percent and it was only 37 percent for implants 0.5 to 5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Although commonly obtained, the necessity of preoperative <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> CT for all patients with CRC is debated. In a retrospective review of 180 resected patients, only 3 of 67 patients had incidental findings on CT that altered the surgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Assessment of hepatic metastases by intraoperative ultrasound and manual palpation of the liver may provide a better yield than preoperative CT, particularly for patients who are found to have transmural involvement <span class=\"nowrap\">(T3/4)</span> at the time of exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>]. However, the increasing use of laparoscopic colonic resections precludes manual palpation, and even with open procedures surgeons may not have adequate access to the liver depending upon the location of the incision and the extent of adhesions from prior surgery.</p><p>The finding of liver metastases on preoperative studies may not necessarily alter the surgical approach to the primary tumor, particularly in patients who are symptomatic from their primary tumor (eg, bleeding, impending obstruction). In patients with four or fewer hepatic lesions, resection may be curative, with five-year relapse-free survival rates of 24 to 38 percent. Although most surgeons advocate resection of the primary tumor and synchronous hepatic metastases at two different operations, some approach both sites at the same time.

At least in theory, imaging of the chest might be of more value for rectal cancer since venous drainage of the lower rectum is through the hemorrhoidal veins to the vena cava, bypassing the liver, and lung metastases might be more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>The major issue is the frequent finding of indeterminate lesions (10 to 30 percent), which add to the clinical complexity (ie, should further preoperative diagnostic workup be undertaken) but are seldom malignant (7 to 20 percent). A systematic review of 12 studies including 5873 patients undergoing staging for a newly diagnosed CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>] found that 732 (9 percent) had indeterminate pulmonary nodules on preoperative chest CT. Of these, 80 (11 percent) turned out to be colorectal metastases at follow-up. Generally, the presence of regional nodal metastases at the time of resection, multiple numbers of indeterminate pulmonary nodules, size &ge;5 mm, rectal as compared with colon cancer, parenchymal versus subpleural location of the nodule, and distant metastases elsewhere were significantly associated with malignancy, while calcification was associated with a benign etiology. Overall, the risk of malignancy for most patients with indeterminate pulmonary nodules (approximately 1 percent) seems sufficiently low that further preoperative diagnostic workup is unnecessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver can identify more hepatic lesions than are visualized by CT, and is particularly valuable in patients with background fatty liver changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. A meta-analysis concluded that MRI is the preferred first-line imaging study for evaluating CRC liver metastases in patients who have not previously undergone therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. However, newer-generation CT scanners and the use of triple-phase imaging during contrast administration has improved sensitivity of CT for detection of liver metastases. In current practice, liver MRI is generally reserved for patients who have suspicious but not definitive findings on CT scan, particularly if better definition of hepatic disease burden is needed in order to make decisions about potential hepatic resection.

Compared with CT and other conventional diagnostic studies, PET scanning had a higher sensitivity (87 versus 66 percent) and specificity (68 versus 59 percent) for the detection of clinically relevant tumor. In a second report, PET scan findings led to a potentially curative resection in 14 of 50 patients (28 percent) with elevated serum CEA levels and a completely normal or equivocal conventional diagnostic work-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of patients who are thought to be present or future candidates for resection of isolated CRC liver metastases.
