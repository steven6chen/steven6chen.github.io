In addition, as many as 50 percent of patients with SSc have clinical evidence of renal involvement, as manifested by mild proteinuria, elevated serum creatinine concentration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. But, many of these findings can be attributed to other causes. Furthermore, they are generally not progressive.</p><p>The most serious renal manifestation of SSc, SRC, occurs in as many as 5 to 20 percent of patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/1,4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Scleroderma renal crisis'</a> below.)</p><p>The course of renal involvement is benign in most patients with SSc who do not have SRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In some cases, the renal manifestations are coincidental and not related to SSc. As an example, in a study of 675 patients with SSc, proteinuria was present in 91 and was considered to be due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> toxicity in 67 (74 percent), with proteinuria developing a mean of 1.2 years after drug initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Proteinuria usually resolved following discontinuation of penicillamine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Drugs'</a>.)</p><p>Impaired renal function in SSc may also reflect prerenal disease associated with heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diuretics, or hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal involvement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Additional causes of renal dysfunction include direct drug toxicity (D-penicillamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>), effects of chronic hypertension, and, rarely, glomerulonephritis.

The frequency of SRC may be decreasing. SRC is observed much less frequently in limited cutaneous SSc. In a study of 50 patients with SRC, for example, 86 percent had diffuse cutaneous SSc, and 10 percent had limited cutaneous SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Similar findings were noted in a report of 110 patients with SSc; diffuse cutaneous SSc was present in 78 percent. In these series, patients classified as &quot;limited scleroderma&quot; may actually have had very early disease and had not yet developed diffuse cutaneous disease. SRC in anticentromere-positive limited scleroderma is very uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SRC is an early complication of SSc that almost invariably occurs within the first five years after the onset of the disease. In the series of 110 cases, SRC occurred at a median duration of 7.5 months from the first non-Raynaud clinical manifestation of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In some cases, SRC may even be the initial manifestation of SSc.</p><p>As described below, early-stage disease or rapidly advancing skin induration may be associated with an increased risk of SRC. However, SRC can also occur in the absence of warning signs. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>SRC is characterized by the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/1,5,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,7,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute onset of renal failure, usually in the absence of previous evidence of significant kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abrupt onset of moderate to marked hypertension, often accompanied by manifestations of malignant hypertension such as hypertensive retinopathy (hemorrhages and exudates) and hypertensive encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

However, some of these patients have blood pressures that are higher than their baseline values (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">130/85</span> mmHg in a young, thin woman whose baseline value was <span class=\"nowrap\">100/70</span> mmHg). These patients have a worse renal outcome and higher mortality than patients with SRC who are hypertensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Worse outcome in normotensive renal crisis has been attributed to several factors, including delayed recognition of SRC, and hence a delayed intervention, and the possibility that normotensive SRC might indicate cardiac failure in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The urine sediment is usually normal. Proteinuria in the range of 500 mg to 1 gram per day may be present in those patients who have concomitant hypertension (since essential hypertension is very common in the general population). However, glomerulonephritis is not a feature of SRC, and, accordingly, microscopic hematuria or cellular casts are uncommon.</p><p/><p>Other findings associated with SRC reflect both the underlying vasculopathy and the marked hypertension. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia can be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851 \">picture 1</a>).

In a series of 110 patients with SSc who developed SRC, 78 percent had the diffuse cutaneous form of SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, a retrospective study of 826 patients with SSc found that rapid progression of skin thickness was an independent predictor of early SRC (odds ratio [OR] 2.05, 95% CI 1.10-3.85) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The presence of palpable tendon friction rubs, common in SSc patients with diffuse skin involvement, is associated with a greater than twofold increase in the risk for SRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The use of higher doses of glucocorticoids might result in salt and volume retention, the initiation or worsening of hypertension, and the triggering of SRC in a subset of these patients. Glucocorticoids may also increase the expression of the endothelin receptors in the kidney.</p><p>Other studies have found similar results, with approximately 60 percent of patients with SRC having had prior recent exposure to glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/8,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence or absence of certain serum autoantibodies appears to predict the risk for SRC.

The characteristic finding is intimal proliferation and thickening that leads to narrowing and obliteration of the vascular lumen, with concentric &quot;onion-skin&quot; hypertrophy. These histopathologic findings are similar to SSc-associated vascular lesions found in other organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70213%7ENEPH%2F54840%7ENEPH%2F69687%7ENEPH%2F78330%7ENEPH%2F75317\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70213 graphicRef54840 graphicRef69687 graphicRef78330 graphicRef75317 \">picture 2A-E</a>).</p><p>SRC is a thrombotic microangiopathy similar to malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic <span class=\"nowrap\">purpura/hemolytic</span> uremic syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(TTP/HUS),</span> radiation nephritis, chronic transplantation rejection, and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Because of the similar renal histologic findings, renal biopsy does <strong>not</strong> definitively establish the diagnosis of SRC.</p><p>Despite nonspecific histologic findings, renal biopsy may be helpful in the diagnosis of SRC by ruling out other diagnoses and by providing useful prognostic information. In a review of renal biopsies from 17 patients with SRC, both a higher number of thrombosed blood vessels and the presence of severe glomerular ischemic collapse correlated with persistent renal failure or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SRC is based upon the characteristic findings in high-risk patients with SSc.

This classification defined blood pressure parameters in SRC and required the presence of at least one associated feature for the diagnosis of SRC. Hypertension was defined as <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;140/90</span> mmHg or a rise in systolic blood pressure &gt;30 mmHg or in diastolic blood pressure &gt;20 mmHg. Associated manifestations in this definition included the following: &gt;50 percent increase in serum creatinine over baseline or &gt;120 percent of upper limit of normal; proteinuria (&gt;2+ or <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/creatinine</span> ratio above the upper limit of normal), microscopic hematuria, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, or hypertensive encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-including-scleroderma-renal-crisis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New onset of blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;150/85</span> mmHg, measured at least twice over the preceding 24 hours.

Renal abnormalities may reflect prerenal failure, direct drug toxicity, effects of chronic hypertension, and, rarely, glomerulonephritis. In many cases, the renal abnormalities are unrelated to scleroderma. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and manifestations of renal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) develops in 5 to 20 percent of SSc patients, most commonly within 48 months of diagnosis and in those with diffuse cutaneous SSc. It is characterized by acute kidney injury (AKI), abrupt onset of moderate to marked hypertension, a normal urinalysis or a urine sediment with only mild proteinuria and few cells or casts, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. It is also important to realize that 10 percent of those with SRC are normotensive.

These changes are indistinguishable from those in malignant hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for SRC include early-stage disease with diffuse and advancing skin involvement, the presence of palpable tendon friction rubs, glucocorticoid use, autoantibodies directed against RNA polymerase, and administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SRC is based upon characteristic findings in high-risk patients with SSc. These include new onset of blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;150/85</span> mmHg and progressive decline in renal function, although a few patients are normotensive. Additional findings may include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, acute retinal changes of malignant hypertension, new-onset proteinuria or hematuria (excluding other causes), and other features. Renal biopsy can be helpful in predicting the persistence of renal failure. SRC must be distinguished from other forms of thrombotic microangiopathy, particularly thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).
