Some clinicians use 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL,</span> which is the level at which parathyroidectomy is often considered in symptomatic patients. Other clinicians use the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) PTH target threshold for treatment, which is nine times above the upper limit of normal for the PTH assay (ie, 585 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> if upper range of normal is 65 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> even though a parathyroidectomy is generally not performed at this value (ie, even if medical therapy is ineffective). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-secondary-hyperparathyroidism-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Severe hyperparathyroidism that is refractory to medical therapy and associated with hypercalcemia (in the absence of medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a>, vitamin D, or calcium-containing phosphate binders) suggests tertiary hyperparathyroidism, in which there is autonomous secretion of PTH that is not responsive to the plasma calcium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Tertiary hyperparathyroidism develops after prolonged parathyroid stimulation from hypocalcemia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> deficiency, and hyperphosphatemia. These stimuli cause increases in PTH synthesis and parathyroid cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Somatic mutations in the proliferating parathyroid cells lead to monoclonal expansion or adenomatous transformation. Transformed cells do not respond to normal suppressive stimuli such as normalization of the serum calcium concentration and calcitriol. The lack of response to suppressive stimuli may be caused by reduced expression of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], lower-density vitamin D receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and decreased expression of klotho and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is characterized clinically by a marked increase in the PTH level that is associated with hypercalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H1627812280\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1149862450\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of refractory hyperparathyroidism is difficult to estimate because of variability in the definition and evolution in the medical therapies used to treat hyperparathyroidism. Because it is a definitive treatment for refractory hyperparathyroidism, the rate of parathyroidectomy is used to provide an estimate of prevalence.</p><p>Among dialysis patients, the rate of parathyroidectomy for refractory hyperparathyroidism is approximately 7 to 10 per 1000 patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This rate has remained largely constant over the past several years despite advances in medical therapy, including the development of calcimimetic agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a>, which decrease the risk for hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>One randomized trial (Evaluation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cinacalcet</a> Hydrochloride Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events [EVOLVE]) suggested that cinacalcet reduces the risk of parathyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In the EVOLVE trial, patients were assigned to receive cinacalcet or placebo in addition to conventional therapy including phosphate binders <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> active vitamin D or synthetic analogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The rate of parathyroidectomy was lower in cinacalcet-treated patients compared with placebo (relative hazard ratio [HR] 0.44, 95% CI 0.36-0.54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The interpretation of this trial is limited by both a high dropout rate in the cinacalcet group (62 percent) and a high rate of crossover in the placebo group (nearly 20 percent).</p><p>However, an analysis of data from a national database spanning 2002 to 2011 showed that, although the rate of parathyroidectomies decreased between 2004 and 2005 (coinciding with availability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> in the United States), the rate rose again in 2006 and remained stable thereafter, despite more widespread cinacalcet use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A suggested reason for the discrepancy is that doses used in EVOLVE were higher than those used in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Refractory hyperparathyroidism requiring parathyroidectomy is far less common among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who are not on dialysis. In an analysis of 32,971 admissions for parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism performed in the United States between 2002 and 2011, 76 percent were performed in patient who had diagnostic or procedure codes specific for dialysis, whereas the remainder had other codes for renal failure or transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627812280\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common signs and symptoms of refractory hyperparathyroidism include hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, bone and joint pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fractures, proximal muscle weakness, extraskeletal calcification <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calciphylaxis and pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Bone and joint pain is caused by osteitis fibrosa cystica, which is a high-turnover form of renal osteodystrophy caused by unremitting hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Pain is primarily in weightbearing joints including hips, knees, ankles, and lower back and is relieved by rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Spontaneous tendon ruptures, primarily involving the quadriceps, Achilles, and patellar tendons, have been described, though are much less common than other symptoms described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p>Extraskeletal calcification may occur in vasculature and be visible on imaging or present as calciphylaxis.

As an example, hyperphosphatemia is ubiquitous and difficult to control among hemodialysis patients, even in the absence of refractory hyperparathyroidism. Hypercalcemia may occur in the setting of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> or other vitamin D analogs or calcium&ndash;containing phosphate binders.

A much more controversial issue is whether patients with refractory hyperparathyroidism, but limited or no associated signs or symptoms, should also undergo parathyroidectomy. Among such patients, there is no consensus regarding indications for parathyroidectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally refer for a parathyroidectomy patients who have severe hyperparathyroidism despite optimal medical management that is accompanied by hyperparathyroid-related signs and symptoms. Parathyroidectomy is effective in treating the signs and symptoms of severe hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>].</p><p>Optimal medical management is defined as treatment with phosphate binders, active vitamin D analogs, and calcimimetics.

This is because many of the symptoms that may be attributed to hyperparathyroidism (such as pain, weakness, and pruritus) are nonspecific and are present in dialysis patients who do not have significant hyperparathyroidism. PTH levels lower than 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> are less likely to be the cause of such symptoms.</p><p>Symptoms should be critically evaluated to make sure that other obvious causes are not present. The medical management should be reviewed to make sure treatment is optimized.

Other causes of hypercalcemia should be excluded, and the treatment of hyperphosphatemia should be reviewed before the parathyroidectomy to be certain that medical options have been tried.

There is variability among transplant centers in the recommended approach for potential transplant recipients who have refractory hyperparathyroidism.</p><p>Most transplant experts suggest parathyroidectomy for patients with severe refractory hyperparathyroidism and moderate to severe symptoms, particularly if transplantation is not imminent. Transplant nephrologists have differing recommendations for patients with mild or no symptoms, even if the parathyroid hormone (PTH) is &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>.</p><p>A rationale for not performing parathyroidectomy prior to transplant is that hyperparathyroidism resolves in most patients after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. However, severe hyperparathyroidism occasionally persists after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. Persistent hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia have been associated with decreased graft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p>In addition, parathyroidectomy may be safer if performed prior to transplantation. Parathyroidectomy performed after transplantation has been associated with abrupt deterioration of renal allograft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. It is not clear whether long-term graft function is adversely affected by parathyroidectomy.</p><p>For potential recipients of deceased-donor kidneys, but not living-donor kidneys, the decision regarding parathyroidectomy may also depend on the anticipated time on the waiting list, which will vary based upon the geographic region. The indications for parathyroidectomy for patients who are expected to have a prolonged wait on the deceased-donor waiting list are likely the same as for patients who are not awaiting transplantation.

(See <a href=\"#H1191655663\" class=\"local\">'Definitions and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We refer for parathyroidectomy most dialysis patients who have persistent hyperparathyroidism (PTH levels &gt;800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> which is refractory to medical therapies and is accompanied by clearly related signs and symptoms. Parathyroidectomy is effective in mitigating most hyperparathyroidism-associated signs and symptoms. It is important to exclude other potential causes of the signs and symptoms prior to parathyroidectomy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform parathyroidectomy for selected dialysis patients who have very severe, sustained hyperparathyroidism (PTH levels &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> that is refractory to medical therapies, even if not accompanied by associated signs and symptoms. The selection of patients must be individualized, depending on age and comorbidities. We generally reserve parathyroidectomy for younger patients (ie, &lt;65 years) and with few comorbidities. Potential but unproven benefits may include improved survival, fracture risk, nutrition, and anemia. (See <a href=\"#H267003420\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with refractory hyperparathyroidism who are actively awaiting transplantation, decisions regarding parathyroidectomy should be jointly made with the transplant center.
