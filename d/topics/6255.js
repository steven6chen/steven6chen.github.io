Patients are at increased risk for death, heart failure, hospitalization, and thromboembolic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology of, disease associations with, and risk factors for AF will be reviewed here. An overview of the presentation and management of patients with AF is discussed elsewhere.

A systematic review of worldwide population-based studies (n = 184) estimated that the number of individuals with AF in 2010 was 33.5 million. </p><p>Most of the studies below have evaluated individuals living in North America or Europe, but other geographies will be specified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of AF depends upon population characteristics, with differences apparent due to age, sex, race, geography, and time period. The following data are primarily derived from studies in which an electrocardiogram was obtained during an office visit rather than ambulatory monitoring. The prevalence of paroxysmal AF, which is more likely to be detected with ambulatory monitoring, is much higher.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age </strong>&ndash; AF is uncommon in infants and children and when present, almost always occurs in association with structural heart disease. Healthy young adults are also at low risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The prevalence of AF increases with age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82929\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82929 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/2,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8-11</a>]. This relationship to age was demonstrated in the ATRIA study, a cross-sectional study of almost 1.9 million subjects in a health maintenance organization in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The overall prevalence of AF was 1 percent; 70 percent were at least 65 years old and 45 percent were &ge;75 years old. The prevalence of AF ranged from 0.1 percent among adults less than 55 years of age to 9 percent in those &ge;80 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77268 \">figure 2</a>). In the STROKESTOP study discussed below, the prevalence of AF in a 75- to 76-year-old population (2011) in Sweden was about 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similar patterns were reported in a European population-based prospective cohort study of 6808 subjects &ge;55 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The prevalence of AF was 5.5 percent, ranging from 0.7 percent in those aged 55 to 59 years and 17.8 percent for those &ge;85 years of age. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sex</strong> &ndash; The prevalence was higher in men than women (1.1 versus 0.8 percent), a difference seen in every age group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77268 \">figure 2</a>). In another study, the rates were 6 versus 5.1 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Race</strong> &ndash; In one study, AF was more frequent in whites than blacks over the age of 50 years (2.2 versus 1.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It had not been determined whether blacks are at lower risk or whites are at higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A study that included nearly 14,000,000 patients receiving hospital-based care in California (United States) between 2005 and 2009 evaluated the relationship between race and incident AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Adjustment was made for known AF risk factors and patient demographics. Compared with Whites, Blacks (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84), Hispanics (HR 0.78), and Asians (HR 0.78) each had a lower AF risk after adjustment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Geography</strong> &ndash; In one study, the age-adjusted prevalence rate (per 100,000 population) was highest in North America (700 to 775) and lowest in Japan and South Korea (250 to 325) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The rate in China was also relatively low (325 to 400).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Time period</strong> &ndash; The prevalence of AF in the population is increasing. In a community-based study of 1.4 million patients in England and Wales, the age-standardized prevalence of AF between 1994 and 1998 increased by 22 and 14 percent in men and women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the ATRIA study, it was estimated that 2.3 million adults in the United States had AF in 1996 and 1997, and that this will increase to 5.6 million by the year 2050, with more than 50 percent being more than 80 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a report from the United States, the prevalence of AF in 2005 was 3.03 million, and the projected prevalence for 2050 was 7.56 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another study, the estimated age-adjusted prevalence rates (per 100,000 population) were 570 in men and 360 in women and 596 (men) and 373 (women) in 1990 and 2010, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102126448\"><span class=\"h3\">Subclinical AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subclinical AF refers to asymptomatic episodes in a patient without a prior history of AF, which are detected only by monitoring techniques. As mentioned above, the prevalence of AF depends on the population studied. Prevalence is also influenced by the duration, sensitivity, and specificity of screening techniques. The following three studies investigated the prevalence of subclinical AF in different populations and using different monitoring techniques:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the STROKESTOP observational study of 7173 individuals 75 to 76 years of age in Sweden, previously unknown AF was detected using intermittent electrocardiographic recordings over three weeks in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ASSERT study monitored (using a dual chamber pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator) 2580 patients, 65 years or older, with hypertension and no history of AF for the development of AF (defined as episodes of atrial rate &gt;190 beats per minute for more than six minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The following findings were noted: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At three months, subclinical AF was detected in about 10 percent of patients. The median number of episodes was two and the median time to detection of the first episode was 36 days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At 2.5 years, subclinical AF was detected in about 35 percent of individuals. Clinical AF developed in about 16 percent of patients with subclinical AF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>This study also evaluated the relationship between the presence of subclinical AF and stroke. This issue is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-stroke#H2560277323\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic stroke&quot;, section on 'Occult atrial fibrillation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the ASSERT-II study of 256 patients (mean age of 74 years; mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 4.1) with an implanted subcutaneous electrocardiographic monitor who were followed for about 16 months, one or more episodes of subclinical AF lasting &ge;5 minutes occurred in 34 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This was a high-risk population, as 48 percent (of the 256 patients) had prior stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism. Two studies have evaluated the prevalence of AF specifically in individuals with cryptogenic transient ischemic attack or stroke:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a study of 56 patients who were evaluated with an outpatient mobile cardiac monitor for a mean of 21 days, AF was detected in 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a study of 149 patients who were evaluated with either a 24-hour Holter monitor or, if that study was normal, an event-loop recording device for seven days, AF was detected in 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of AF, similar to the prevalence, increases with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/10,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20-22</a>]. In a longitudinal study in which 3983 male Air Force recruits were followed for 44 years, 7.5 percent developed AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The risk increased with advancing age (from 0.5 per 1000 person-years before age 50 to 9.7 per 1000 person years after age 70).</p><p>The lifetime risk for the development of AF was analyzed in a report from the Framingham Heart Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A total of 8725 patients were followed from 1968 to 1999 (176,166 person-years of follow-up); 936 developed AF. The risk of developing AF from age 40 to age 95 was 26 percent for men and 23 percent for women. Lifetime risk did not change substantially with increasing index age because AF incidence rose with age; the risk of developing AF from age 80 to age 95 was 23 percent for men and 22 percent for women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irrespective of the underlying risk factor(s), changes in the anatomy and electrophysiology of the atrial myocardium are likely important. Thus, atrial fibrillation (AF) is usually associated with some underlying heart disease. Atrial enlargement, an elevation in atrial pressure, or infiltration or inflammation of the atria are often seen. </p><p>Atrial premature beats appear to be most important as a trigger in patients with paroxysmal AF who have normal or near-normal hearts. The relative importance of atrial premature beats or other triggers versus an abnormal substrate is much less clear in patients with significant structural heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanisms of AF are presented in detail separately.

Rheumatic heart disease, although now uncommon in developed countries, is associated with a much higher incidence of AF. Paroxysmal AF (PAF) is associated with the same disorders as chronic (permanent) AF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertensive heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a longitudinal study of male air crew recruits, a history of hypertension increased the risk of developing AF 1.42-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although this is a relatively small increase in risk, the high frequency of hypertension in the general population results in hypertensive heart disease being the most common underlying disorder in patients with AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AF is not commonly associated with CHD unless it is complicated by acute myocardial infarction (MI) or heart failure (HF). AF occurs transiently in 6 to 10 percent of patients with an acute MI, presumably due to atrial ischemia or atrial stretching secondary to HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. These patients have a worse prognosis that is mostly due to comorbidities such as older age and HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-arrhythmias-after-myocardial-infarction#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation'</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of AF is much lower in patients with chronic stable CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In the Coronary Artery Surgical Study (CASS), which included over 18,000 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease, AF was present in only 0.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These patients probably had chronic AF; the prevalence of PAF may be higher. AF was associated with age greater than 60, male sex, mitral regurgitation (MR), and HF; there was no association between AF and the number of coronary arteries involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Valvular heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost any valvular lesion that leads to significant stenosis or regurgitation is associated with the development of AF.
