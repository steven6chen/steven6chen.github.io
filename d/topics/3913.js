As a result, there is an increase in pressure within the left atrium, pulmonary vasculature, and right side of the heart, while the left ventricle is unaffected in isolated MS. Nearly all cases of MS are caused by rheumatic heart disease with mitral commissural adhesion; thickened, immobile mitral valve leaflets; and fibrosis, thickening, shortening, fusion, and calcification of the chordae tendineae. Infrequent causes of MS include mitral annular calcification and congenital MS (including parachute mitral valve). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and natural history of mitral stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of mitral annular calcification&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the clinical features and evaluation of MS due to rheumatic valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These symptoms are primarily related to the severity of the valvular stenosis, as it impacts the left atrial pressure, pulmonary pressures, pulmonary vascular resistance, and cardiac output. However, many patients with severe MS do not recognize symptoms because slow progression of disease is accompanied by a gradual reduction in activity. As a result, a careful history regarding exercise tolerance is often required to document a slow decline in functional status. (See <a href=\"#H2007698691\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below.)</p><p>Less common clinical presentations include hemoptysis, chest pain (often due to pulmonary hypertension), fatigue (which may be associated with low forward flow and a low transmitral gradient), ascites and lower extremity edema associated with right heart failure (particularly in patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension), stroke or other thromboembolic event (particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation), hoarseness, and infective endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Dyspnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common and often the only symptom of MS is dyspnea, which occurs in up to 70 percent of symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Dyspnea usually results from the elevation in left atrial pressure, and pulmonary venous hypertension, which leads to reduced compliance of the lungs and a decrease in vital capacity. Dyspnea also may be related to an inability to increase the cardiac output with increased metabolic demands. </p><p>As the degree of MS increases, dyspnea occurs with very little effort and orthopnea may also occur. A common complaint at this time is fatigue due to the reduction in cardiac output.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemoptysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The increased pulmonary pressures and vascular congestion can lead to hemoptysis, which may have a variety of clinical manifestations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden hemorrhage (pulmonary apoplexy) due to the rupture of thin walled and dilated bronchial veins when there is a sudden increase in left atrial pressure. This complication is rarely life-threatening, despite the large amount of bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood-tinged sputum induced by severe coughing associated with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or bronchitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pink frothy sputum resulting from pulmonary edema.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11786166\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrial fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is suggested by an irregularly irregular pulse on physical examination and confirmed by electrocardiogram. AF is common in patients with MS due to the elevation of left atrial pressure and consequent left atrial enlargement. The prevalence of AF is higher with more severe disease, increasing age, and the presence of other valvular abnormalities. In a report that included 854 patients with MS, AF was present in 47 percent overall; the rate was higher in those with other valvular abnormalities (such as mitral or tricuspid regurgitation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The two independent risk factors for AF were left atrial diameter and increasing age. In other studies, the rate of AF among patients with severe MS ranged from 4 to 7 percent with mean patient age under 30 years to as high as 50 to 60 percent when the mean age was 50 to 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>As discussed below, AF is one of the conditions that can precipitate or exacerbate symptoms such as dyspnea or hemoptysis. AF can lead to clinical decompensation via two mechanisms: the loss of atrial contraction, which plays an important role in the generation of adequate left atrial pressure to maintain blood flow across the stenotic valve; and the rapid ventricular response, which diminishes the time available for filling of the left ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamic-consequences-of-atrial-fibrillation-and-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Thromboembolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not infrequently, the first presentation of MS is an embolic event, most commonly cerebral. Prior to the widespread use of anticoagulant therapy and surgical treatment in patients with MS, as many as 30 percent of patients with MS experienced an embolic event during the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis/abstract/2,9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-13</a>]. While the most common site for clinically evident embolism is the cerebral circulation, any organ may be involved, especially spleen, kidneys, and the coronary circulation, resulting in a myocardial infarction. Though most emboli in patients with MS arise from the left atrium, emboli can also arise from the right atrium when there is pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular and atrial dilatation. Emboli from this site lead to pulmonary embolism and infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with MS rarely present with chest pain. Although the pain often resembles angina and may be due to underlying coronary artery disease or a coronary artery embolism, it is most commonly the result of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. Another cause of intermittent chest pain is an atrial tachyarrhythmia with left atrial and pulmonary vascular distension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Right-sided heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pulmonary hypertension eventually leads to increased right ventricular and right atrial pressures, right ventricular enlargement, tricuspid regurgitation, and signs of right-sided heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis#H436311270\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and natural history of mitral stenosis&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary hypertension'</a>.)</p><p>Signs of right-sided heart failure include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased jugular venous pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower extremity edema, which may progress to involve the upper thighs, sacral area, and abdominal wall; ascites and pleural effusions can also occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatomegaly in which the liver may be pulsatile if tricuspid regurgitation is present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Hoarseness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the left atrium becomes very large, there may be compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, leading to hoarseness (Ortner's syndrome or cardiovocal syndrome) or coughing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hoarseness-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hoarseness in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5637497\"><span class=\"h3\">Infective endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the mitral valve is deformed, there is the potential for infective endocarditis. This complication is primarily associated with mild MS when the valve is stiff and fibrotic. Endocarditis is uncommon once the valve becomes calcified and very rigid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5637420\"><span class=\"h2\">Precipitants of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any situation that increases the cardiac output, which raises transmitral flow, or causes tachycardia, which decreases diastolic filling time, can markedly increase the transmitral pressure gradient and precipitate symptoms such as dyspnea or hemoptysis. Activities or conditions that can provoke symptoms include exertion, emotional stress, fever, pulmonary infection, AF, and pregnancy.</p><p>As an example, the increase in heart rate and cardiac output during pregnancy can substantially increase the resting transmitral gradient in women with MS, which can lead to symptoms in a previously asymptomatic (and perhaps undiagnosed) patient or an exacerbation of symptoms in an already symptomatic patient. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination, especially examination of the arterial and venous pulses and the heart, can be diagnostic for MS. However, except for severe long-standing disease, the physical findings are subtle and the murmur may be difficult to appreciate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2007698739\"><span class=\"h3\">General examination</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When MS is severe and the cardiac output is diminished, cutaneous vasoconstriction results in pinkish-purple patches on the cheeks (mitral facies). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy can lead to a prominent &quot;a&quot; wave (atrial contraction or systole) in jugular venous pulsations, reflecting elevated right atrial pressure. The &quot;a&quot; wave is absent in patients with AF and only a prominent &quot;v&quot; wave (atrial filling during ventricular systole when the tricuspid valve is closed) is seen. If present, tricuspid regurgitation can lead to a prominent &quot;c-v&quot; wave (reflecting regurgitation of blood into the right atrium) and the neck veins are very pulsatile. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation and percussion of the chest wall reveals an apical impulse that is generally normal, although it may be reduced in magnitude, reflecting the decreased left ventricular filling. However, if pulmonary hypertension is present, there may be a right ventricular heave (parasternal lift) and a palpable S2. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-precordial-pulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the precordial pulsation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung examination may demonstrate crackles (rales) consistent with pulmonary edema. However, pulmonary congestion is absent in some patients with chronically elevated left atrial pressure, which has been attributed to lymphatic hyperfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced disease may be associated with the signs of right-sided heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2007698876\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular examination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2007698746\"><span class=\"h4\">Pulse examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arterial pulses are reduced in volume due to the decreased stroke volume. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2007698784\"><span class=\"h4\">Cardiac auscultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac auscultation to identify and evaluate the heart sounds, opening snap, and murmur(s) may be diagnostic for MS with careful patient positioning in a quiet room. However, the characteristic opening snap and murmur may be difficult to appreciate, particularly when MS presents during pregnancy or with rapid AF. The following findings are characteristic for MS, but their absence does not exclude the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h5\">Heart sounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a result of the elevated left atrial pressure, the stenotic (but noncalcified) mitral leaflets are still widely separated at the onset of ventricular contraction. Thus, the first heart sound (S1) is loud, reflecting the increased excursion of the stiff leaflets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55136\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55136 \">movie 1A</a>). As the leaflets become more rigid and calcified, their motion is limited and S1 becomes soft. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The second heart sound is initially normal but, with the development of pulmonary hypertension, P2 becomes increased in intensity and may be widely transmitted. As pressure increases further, splitting of S2 is reduced and ultimately S2 becomes a single sound.</p><p>A third heart sound of left ventricular origin is not heard in pure MS because of the obstruction to flow across the mitral valve. However, it may be present if there is coexisting aortic or mitral regurgitation or may be generated from the right ventricle.</p><p>A fourth heart sound may be heard, most often originating from the right ventricle when it is hypertrophied and dilated and the patient is still in sinus rhythm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h5\">Opening snap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is heard at the apex when the leaflets are still mobile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55136%7ECARD%2F66921\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55136 graphicRef66921 \">movie 1A-B</a>). The OS is due to the abrupt halt in leaflet motion in early diastole, after rapid initial rapid opening, due to fusion at the leaflet tips. It is best heard at the apex and lower left sternal border. The OS following S2 may be mistaken for a split S2 unless the examiner recognizes that the OS is best appreciated at the apex, not the base. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As the MS progresses and left atrial pressure is higher, the OS occurs earlier after S2 or A2. Thus, the shorter the A2-OS interval, the more severe the MS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h5\">Diastolic murmur</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The murmur caused by MS is a low-pitched diastolic rumble that is most prominent at the apex. It is heard best in a quiet room with the patient lying on the left side in held expiration and by using the bell of the stethoscope or the low frequency range of an electronic stethoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55136\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55136 \">movie 1A</a>).</p><p>Although the intensity of the diastolic murmur does not correlate with the severity of the stenosis, the duration of the murmur is helpful since it reflects the transvalvular gradient and the duration of blood flow across the valve.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When MS is mild, the gradient is confined to atrial systole and hence the murmur is heard late in diastole, just before S1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the stenosis becomes more severe, there is a gradient at the very onset of the diastolic flow period, immediately following the OS. This early diastolic murmur is decrescendo, becoming softer as the left atrial pressure falls and the transvalvular gradient decreases. If the patient is still in sinus rhythm, the increase in atrial pressure after atrial contraction results in an increase in the loudness of the murmur, termed &quot;presystolic accentuation&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55136\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55136 \">movie 1A</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With more severe MS, there is a continuous gradient throughout all of the diastolic flow period, from mitral valve opening to mitral valve closure. The diastolic murmur may be inaudible or absent when MS is very severe, due to the very slow flow across the mitral valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>There are several maneuvers that have been used in the past for evaluation of heart sounds in MS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pharmacologic-maneuvers-in-the-differential-diagnosis-of-heart-murmurs-and-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pharmacologic maneuvers in the differential diagnosis of heart murmurs and sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diastolic murmur and OS are diminished with inspiration, but augmented with expiration (in contrast to tricuspid stenosis). With inspiration, the A2-OS interval widens and a distinct P2 may be heard.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing venous return (eg, by lying the patient down and lifting the legs) augments the gradient; as a result, the diastolic murmur lengthens while the A2-OS intervals shorten. Similar changes are seen in response to exercise. In contrast, reducing venous return with amyl nitrate, the Valsalva maneuver, or standing after squatting shortens the murmur and lengthens the A2-OS interval.</p><p/><p>There are other murmurs or sounds that may be heard in patients with MS, particularly when pulmonary hypertension is present.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pulmonary ejection sound, which diminishes with inspiration when the pulmonary arteries dilate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the development of tricuspid regurgitation, there is a holosystolic murmur best heard along the right sternal border that increases with inspiration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-tricuspid-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical features, and evaluation of tricuspid regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A faint and brief murmur of pulmonic regurgitation (Graham Steell murmur) may be heard at the base.

The most important finding on ECG in patients with MS is the presence of AF. Other findings on the surface ECG are non-specific and are not recommended as part of the diagnostic evaluation. Findings on ECG include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The QRS amplitude and morphology are normal unless there is mitral regurgitation or coexistent aortic valve disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left atrial hypertrophy and enlargement results in a P wave that becomes broader (duration in lead II &gt;0.12 sec), is of increased amplitude, and is notched (due to the delay in left atrial activation). This is termed &quot;P-mitrale.&quot; The left atrial changes also produce a prominent negative terminal portion of the P wave in lead V1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The P wave changes are not seen in patients with AF. The fibrillatory waves are coarse, generally &gt;0.1 mV in amplitude, reflecting left atrial hypertrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional changes occur with the development of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. The frontal axis shifts to the right (S&gt;R in lead I and aVL) and a tall R wave develops in V1 and V2 (R&gt;S or <span class=\"nowrap\">R/S</span> ratio &gt;1).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5638474\"><span class=\"h3\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chest radiograph is recommended only for evaluation of heart failure symptoms in patients with MS and routine periodic chest radiograph is not recommended. However, an initial diagnosis of MS may be suggested by abnormal findings on a chest radiograph requested for other indications. The chest radiograph in mild MS may be normal, although there is often evidence of some enlargement of the left atrium and appendage. Left atrial enlargement may produce a &quot;double density,&quot; the left heart border becomes straightened (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100435\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100435 \">image 1</a>), the left bronchus is elevated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100437\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100437 \">image 2</a>), and, on the lateral projection, the left atrium is displaced posteriorly, impinging on the esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100439\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100439 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>The size of the left atrium reflects the duration of severe MS.
