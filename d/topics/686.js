It is increasingly used to assess patients with variable BP readings in the office, wide discrepancies between the BP readings at home and in the clinician's office (ie, &quot;white coat&quot; hypertension), and secondary forms of hypertension such as chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p><p>The utility and limitations of pediatric ABPM, and information on performing and interpreting ABPM studies in children will be reviewed here. The definition, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertension in children based upon office BP measurement (casual BP) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonemergent-treatment-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonemergent treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528647\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ABPM has been successfully used in the evaluation of BP infants, toddlers, and older children in research settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. However, it is most feasible for clinical use in children old enough to cooperate with the procedure. ABPM needs to be performed in a standardized, reliable fashion to provide accurate recordings, especially in small children and infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2615918\"><span class=\"h2\">Device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ABPM uses a portable automated device that records blood pressure (BP) over a specific time period (usually 24 hours). ABPM monitors most commonly used in children are small oscillometric devices, which are worn on a belt in a pouch. Oscillometric ABPM devices directly measure the mean arterial pressure and back-calculate the systolic and diastolic BP using an algorithm that is unique to each device manufacturer. Pulse wave amplitude and the elastic properties of the arterial wall, which are important factors in algorithm development, are different in children and adults. Thus, both the monitors and algorithms used in ABPM need to be validated using a standard protocol in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Technical limitations'</a> below.)</p><p>Development of normative data for pediatric ABPM has been difficult because of the variation of each algorithm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Devices utilizing the auscultatory technique are also available, but are less frequently used in children because they are more cumbersome to wear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. In addition, there are no published normative pediatric ABPM data for auscultatory devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2615931\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedural approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our center, we follow the approach that is outlined in the 2014 Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) on ABPM in children and adolescents, which includes the following key points for obtaining accurate, reliable, and reproducible results in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trained personnel should maintain the functionality of the equipment, apply the device, and educate the patient and family about the device, including accurate recording of medication, sleep, and activity during the recording period. Patients should be instructed not to get the ABPM device wet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with office BP measurement, an appropriately sized cuff must be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Cuff size and placement'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ABPM cuff is placed on the nondominant arm. Exceptions include the presence of a permanent dialysis access in children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or placement of an arterial-to-pulmonary shunt in some children with cyanotic heart disease, in which case the dominant arm is used. In addition, if there is a significant interarm BP difference, the device should be placed on the arm with the higher BP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After applying the ABPM device, ambulatory BP should be measured and compared with resting BP obtained in the office (casual BP). If the average of three values is &gt;5 mmHg higher or lower, cuff placement should be adjusted or the device checked for calibration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are advised to keep the arm with the cuff still while inflating to prevent exertion-induced error in BP measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. It is desirable to perform ABPM on a school day in order to capture the child or adolescent's typical activity level. However, participation in competitive sports or other intense physical activity is typically discouraged during ABPM.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Readings are usually taken every 20 minutes while awake and every 30 to 60 minutes while asleep. This should result in a sufficient number of recordings for interpretation during both sleep and wake periods. Patients or their parents should be instructed to keep a diary of sleep-wake times.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17543660\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information from each measurement by the ABPM device is downloaded to a computer and then analyzed, usually with manufacturer-specific software. Using the diary supplied by the patient, the monitoring period is divided into wake and sleep periods.</p><p>The following variables are calculated for the wake and sleep periods, and for the entire 24 hours:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean BP &ndash; Mathematical average of the systolic and diastolic BP readings captured in each monitoring period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BP load &ndash; Percentage of readings above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of systolic or diastolic BP based on ambulatory normative data, which is dependent on age, gender, and <span class=\"nowrap\">wake/sleep</span> status. In adults, a high BP load is associated with cardiovascular (CV) risk. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Normative data'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nocturnal dipping &ndash; Normally, the average nocturnal BP is approximately 15 percent lower than daytime values, which is referred to as nocturnal dipping. Failure of the BP to fall at least 10 percent during sleep is called non-dipping. In adults, non-dipping has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and other CV complications. In children, non-dipping is more common in secondary forms of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and in the obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, there are no long-term data available regarding increased CV risk for children with non-dipping nocturnal BP. (See <a href=\"#H74807452\" class=\"local\">'Sustained hypertension and nocturnal nondipping'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring and white coat hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Nocturnal blood pressure and nondippers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dipping status is based on the percent of dipping, which is calculated for both systolic and diastolic BP using the following formula:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Percent dip = [(mean awake BP &ndash; mean sleep BP) &divide; mean awake BP] x 100</p></div></div><p/><p>Data for ABPM recordings should be inspected visually for any gross inconsistencies in heart rate, and sleep and awake BP measurements based on the child's age, which may lead to inaccurate interpretation of the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h3\">Normative data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, assessment using valid normative ambulatory pediatric BP values should be used to determine whether or not an individual patient has normal or elevated BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Unfortunately, such data are limited in children, especially in those with a non-European ethnic background [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Until such data are available, we use the normative data from a single study of approximately 1000 Central European children and adolescents, while recognizing their limitations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94619\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94619 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94618 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94617\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94617 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F94616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94616 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/5,6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Results only included information from white children from mid-European countries. It is uncertain whether they apply to other ethnic populations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data were obtained by oscillometric monitors that rely upon a proprietary algorithm to derive systolic and diastolic BP values. There was a lack of variability in diastolic BP, which remained fixed for both sexes and height, a finding that is in direct contrast to normative data for <span class=\"nowrap\">office/casual</span> BP measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>]. This lack of diastolic variability regardless of height or age raises questions about the reliability of the algorithm used to calculate diastolic BP levels. In contrast, systolic BP appropriately varied with height and the age of the patient.</p><p/><p>Since BP is increased by physical activity, normative data based upon resting BP values cannot reliably be used for ambulatory BP recordings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This was illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 1120 British schoolchildren using ausculatory devices, both systolic and diastolic ambulatory BP were greater than normal resting levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small study of Brazilian children using oscillometric devices, both mean systolic and diastolic BP from ABPM were greater than measurements obtained in the office setting or home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Results from these studies demonstrate further efforts are needed to establish normative ABPM values for all pediatric populations and to correlate them with validated values that are office based.

This was illustrated in a retrospective review of 267 children referred to a pediatric hypertension tertiary clinic over an 18-month period of time from 2005 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this cohort of 126 children, 58 patients (46 percent) had white coat hypertension, 62 (49 percent) had stage 1 hypertension, and 6 (5 percent) had stage 2 hypertension (severe hypertension). For a child with white coat hypertension, the estimated savings of initial detection by ABPM prior to performing the routine evaluation of hypertension at this center (ie, blood tests, renal ultrasonography, and echocardiography) was USD $2155 per patient.</p><p>However, several studies suggest that pediatric white coat hypertension may not be a benign condition, as some children and adolescents have increased left ventricular (LV) mass index and carotid artery intimal-media thickness. In adults, those with white coat hypertension also appear to be at risk for progression to ambulatory (sustained) hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; however, similar data are not currently available for pediatric patients. Data suggest that the LV mass index of children with white coat hypertension falls between that of children with normal BP and those with ambulatory (sustained) hypertension matched by body mass index (BMI), gender, and age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/22-24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24,27</a>].

Normally, BP follows a circadian pattern, being highest late in the day and falling 13 to 20 percent below daytime levels during sleep at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/13,16,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,30,31</a>]. On ABPM studies, this circadian variation is referred to as &quot;dipping.&quot; A nondipping pattern is defined as less than a 10 percent nighttime fall in systolic BP. Children with sustained hypertension are less likely to have nocturnal dipping compared with normotensive children, and children with white coat hypertension have a risk of a &quot;nondipping&quot; BP pattern in between the two groups. This was illustrated in a study using 24-hour ABPM monitoring that demonstrated normal nocturnal dipping in 64 percent of hypertensive children (n = 129), 74 percent of children with white coat hypertension (n = 54), and 85 percent of normotensive controls (n = 146) who were matched by age, height, and gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Another study of approximately 500 children showed that obese children had blunted nocturnal dipping based on ABPM measurements compared with lean children.

Our standard approach includes application of the device to the nondominant arm, comparing ambulatory readings with an office measurement for correlation, and instructions to the patient and parents on daily recording of medication, activity, and sleep periods. In order to obtain a sufficient number of recordings for interpretation, we program the device to take readings every 20 minutes while awake and every 30 minutes while asleep.

ABPM measurements include mean arterial pressure, BP load, and percent dipping. These values are then combined according to the AHA recommendations to determine a result for each study. A summary report is generated and placed in the patient's electronic medical record.

As a result, pediatric hypertension for both office and ambulatory measurements is defined statistically based on current limited normative ABPM data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/6,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25</a>].</p><p>However, the adult definition should be used when ambulatory BP values exceeded the accepted criteria for adults (24 hour mean value of <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg, mean daytime value of <span class=\"nowrap\">135/85</span> mmHg and mean night-time value of <span class=\"nowrap\">125/75</span> mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In adults, the definition of hypertension is based on large datasets that correlate BP values with outcome measures, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and progression of kidney disease. In addition, ABPM normative data are available from sizeable adult cohorts, and long-term results on outcome from smaller studies. These data are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications of hypertension'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring and white coat hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Definition of hypertension'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-and-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-and-white-coat-hypertension-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring and white coat hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Prognostic value of ABPM'</a>.)</p><p>Based on the available literature, the threshold ABPM values used to diagnose hypertension are higher than those used for <span class=\"nowrap\">casual/office</span> thresholds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This may lead to misdiagnosis if office normative values are applied to ambulatory measurements to diagnose hypertension in children. This was illustrated in a study that compared the prevalence of hypertension in a group of children referred for hypertension using either office normative data based on the 2004 National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group (NHBPEP) guidelines or limited ABPM normative data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. There was poor agreement in the diagnosis of hypertension between the two criteria. Hypertension was detected less frequently during the daytime and more frequently at night when using the ABPM norms versus when criteria from the NHBPEP guidelines were used.</p><p>In addition, there may not be good agreement between the two definitions of ABPM hypertension used in children; mean BP &gt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile or BP load &gt;30 percent (percent of BP readings &gt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile). In one study, agreement between these definitions was only moderate to good [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>These data highlight the need for improved correlation of measurements between ABPM and office readings or outcome measures in the pediatric age group. Additional studies are required to validate the current consensus definition of hypertension based upon ABPM data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Technical limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulse wave amplitude and the elastic properties of the arterial wall are different in children and adults. These are important factors in the development of the algorithms used in ambulatory oscillometric monitors. Thus, both the monitors and algorithms used in ABPM need to be validated in children. Data from a few studies show that commercially available monitors developed for adults performed only fairly in the accurate and consistent recording of BP in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-children/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p>Other technical issues include patient acceptance and tolerance of the device, especially in young children, and ensuring the use of the appropriate cuff size. Accuracy of measurement is age dependent, as lower systolic BP values, which occur in infants and young children, are associated with poorer monitoring quality because the cardiac cycle is shorter, resulting in a shorter time to measure oscillation. Allergy to latex in some BP cuffs also may preclude ABPM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Costs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, one of the major limitations of the use of ABPM is the lack of coverage by third party payers. However, our experience has been that reimbursement can be obtained for most ABPM studies if appropriate documentation, including justification for the study and a report of the study results, is provided to the patient's insurance carrier. Based on a 2003 determination by the <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/&amp;token=Hj0v5/Mll/opXnQbf+Qe7RQQal9GGjKjI3+daje4HzM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6124\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>, many third party payers will reimburse for ABPM if it is used appropriately to determine the presence or absence of white coat hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H460617212\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
