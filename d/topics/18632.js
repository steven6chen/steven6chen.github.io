In comparison, they are rare in children, except for patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 2&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of patients with vestibular schwannomas will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall incidence of vestibular schwannomas is about one per 100,000 person-years. However, the incidence appears to be increasing, due at least in part to the incidental diagnosis of asymptomatic lesions with the widespread use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. As an example, a retrospective analysis of 46,000 MRI scans done for other reasons identified eight unsuspected vestibular schwannomas (0.02 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and autopsy studies suggest that the prevalence may be even higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The median age at diagnosis is approximately 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The tumors are unilateral in more than 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], affecting the right and left sides with equal frequency. Bilateral vestibular schwannomas are primarily limited to patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-2#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 2&quot;, section on 'Vestibular schwannomas'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953390426\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral vestibular schwannomas are one of the characteristic clinical features of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Studies in NF2 patients led to the identification of the neurofibromin 2 gene, which is located on chromosome 22. The NF2 gene produces merlin, also known as schwannomin, a cell membrane-related protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. Biallelic inactivation of the NF2 gene is found in most sporadic vestibular schwannomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 2&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-brain-tumors#H537377066\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Neurofibromatosis type 2'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to NF2, other risk factors that have been associated with the development of vestibular schwannomas in epidemiologic studies include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childhood exposure to low-dose radiation for benign conditions of the head and neck has been associated with an increased risk of vestibular schwannoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In a series of 2311 children irradiated between 1939 and 1962, 41 vestibular schwannomas were identified with a latent period of 20 to 55 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The increase in risk was proportional to the dose of radiation to the cerebellopontine angle (relative risk per Gy 1.14). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-brain-tumors#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Radiation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a history of parathyroid adenoma may have an increased risk for developing vestibular schwannomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The reason for this association is unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some but not all studies have shown an increased incidence of various brain tumors, including vestibular schwannomas, associated with the use of cellular telephones. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-brain-tumors#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Cellular telephones and radiofrequency radiation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are conflicting data on noise exposure as a risk factor for vestibular schwannomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/5,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10-13</a>], despite experimental studies supporting biological plausibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Most studies finding a positive association have relied on self-reported measures of noise exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/5,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11,12</a>], making it difficult to exclude recall bias as an alternative explanation for the findings. In a population-based case-control study that used a job exposure matrix to assign noise exposure levels in addition to self report, there was no association between occupational noise exposure and vestibular schwannoma among over 400 cases and 710 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The same study, however, found a positive association between vestibular schwannoma and self-reported exposure to loud noise in leisure activities without hearing protection (OR 1.5).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vestibular schwannomas arise from perineural elements of the Schwann cell and are similar pathologically to peripheral schwannomas found in other parts of the body. They occur with equal frequency on the superior and inferior branches of the vestibular nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55465 \">figure 1</a>); only rarely are they derived from the cochlear portion of the VIII nerve.</p><p>Microscopically, zones of alternately dense and sparse cellularity, called Antoni A and B areas respectively, are characteristic of vestibular schwannomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51843\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51843 \">picture 1</a>). Malignant degeneration is extremely rare with only six cases having been reported. Immunohistochemical staining for S100 protein is usually positive in both the benign and the rare malignant forms of this tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms associated with vestibular schwannoma can be due to cranial nerve involvement, cerebellar compression, or tumor progression.</p><p>The clinical presentations of these tumors are illustrated by a series of 1000 vestibular schwannomas treated at a single institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Clinical manifestations in this series included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cochlear nerve &ndash; Symptomatic cochlear nerve involvement occurred in 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The two major symptoms were hearing loss and tinnitus. Hearing loss was present in 95 percent but only two-thirds of these patients were aware of this limitation. The hearing loss was usually chronic, with an average duration of about four years. Occasionally, vestibular schwannomas can present with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden sensorineural hearing loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Tinnitus was present in 63 percent with an average duration of three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The incidence of tinnitus was higher in hearing than in deaf patients but was also present in 46 percent of deaf patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vestibular nerve &ndash; Involvement of the vestibular nerve occurred in 61 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Affected patients frequently acknowledged having unsteadiness while walking, which was typically mild to moderate in nature and frequently fluctuated in severity. True spinning vertigo was uncommon because these slow growing tumors cause gradual rather than acute asymmetries in vestibular function. In this setting, the central vestibular system can often compensate for the gradual loss of input from one side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most nondescript vertiginous sensations, such as brief tilting or veering, can suggest the presence of a vestibular schwannoma. The decision whether to obtain an MRI for a patient with these symptoms depends upon clinical judgment, with no good data in the literature about the likelihood that someone with such symptoms harbors a schwannoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-etiology-and-differential-diagnosis-of-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, etiology, and differential diagnosis of vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trigeminal nerve &ndash; Trigeminal nerve disturbances occurred in 17 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The most common symptoms were facial numbness (paresthesia), hypesthesia, and pain. The average duration of symptoms was 1.3 years; the symptoms usually occurred after hearing loss had been present for more than two years and vestibular symptoms for more than one year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigeminal-neuralgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigeminal neuralgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial nerve &ndash; The facial nerve was involved in 6 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The primary symptoms were facial paresis and, less often, taste disturbances (due to nervus intermedius impairment). Xerophthalmia, paroxysmal lacrimation, and xerostomia can also be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor progression &ndash; Other presenting signs can be the result of tumor progression, leading to pressure on adjacent posterior fossa structures. Very large tumors can press on the cerebellum or brainstem and result in ataxia. Brainstem compression, cerebellar tonsil herniation, hydrocephalus and death can occur in untreated cases. The functions of the lower cranial nerves can also become impaired, leading to dysarthria, dysphagia, aspiration, and hoarseness.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of vestibular schwannoma is generally suggested by the presence of asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss (which should be confirmed by audiometry) or other cranial nerve deficits. Such symptoms may lead to imaging with MRI or CT. Vestibular schwannomas account for 80 to 90 percent of posterior fossa lesions that are identified in this way.</p><p>The differential diagnosis includes meningioma, which accounts for 4 to 10 percent of cases. Other less common causes of such lesions include facial nerve schwannomas, gliomas, cholesterol cysts, cholesteatomas, hemangiomas, aneurysms, arachnoid cysts, lipomas, and metastatic tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hearing tests are typically abnormal due to involvement of the acoustic nerve. The Weber and Rinne tests may be useful in suggesting asymmetric sensorineural hearing impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hearing loss in adults&quot;, section on 'Examination'</a>.)</p><p>Further neurologic examination may reveal other cranial nerve deficits. A decreased or absent ipsilateral corneal reflex and facial twitching or hypesthesia may occur as cranial nerves V and VII become affected. Other cranial nerve deficits are uncommon unless the tumor is large. Romberg, Hall-Pike, and other common office balance tests are typically normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Audiometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Audiometry is the best initial screening laboratory test for the diagnosis of vestibular schwannoma, since only 5 percent of patients will have a normal test. Pure tone and speech audiometry should be performed in an acoustically shielded area. Test results typically show an asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss, usually more prominent in the higher frequencies. Hearing loss does not necessarily correlate with tumor size. The speech discrimination score is usually markedly reduced in the affected ear and out of proportion to the measured hearing loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hearing loss in adults&quot;, section on 'Formal audiologic assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Many other auditory tests have been used historically to try to diagnose vestibular schwannomas. These include acoustic reflex testing, impedance audiometry, and Bekesy audiometry. They have limited accuracy and diagnostic value, and their utility has diminished with the advent of brainstem-evoked response audiometry <span class=\"nowrap\">(AER/ABR)</span>.</p><p>Brainstem-evoked response audiometry can be used as a further screening measure in patients with unexplained asymmetries in standard audiometric testing. Test results show a delay in nerve conduction time on the affected side, reflecting the probable presence of a tumor. Prior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ABR was the most accurate screening modality. In centers experienced with its use, the test shows abnormalities in 90 to 95 percent of patients with tumors. However, the false negative rate can be as high as 30 percent with small vestibular schwannomas, and there is a 10 percent false positive rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Vestibular testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vestibular testing has limited utility as a screening test for the diagnosis of vestibular schwannoma because of the accuracy of evoked response audiometry. When testing is performed, a decreased or absent caloric response on the affected side may be seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure of choice is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can detect tumors as small as 1 to 2 mm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86508\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86508 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. When brainstem testing is abnormal or the suspicion for a vestibular schwannoma is high for another reason, MRI scanning with gadolinium contrast should be performed, including millimeter sections through the internal auditory meatus. If a patient cannot tolerate MRI, high resolution CT scanning with and without contrast is an alternative.</p><p>Vestibular schwannomas are seen on MRI and CT scans as enhancing lesions in the region of the internal auditory canal with variable extension into the cerebellopontine angle. CT scans with bone windows can also be of prognostic significance as the extent of widening of the IAC and the extent of tumor growth anterior and caudal to the IAC are predictive of postoperative hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Fast spin echo MRI may be useful as a screening test due to its low cost compared to gadolinium MRI, noninvasiveness, and high sensitivity and specificity. In one study of 25 patients and 50 ears, there were 11 true positives and 39 true negatives on gadolinium MRI. There were no false positives or false negatives with fast spin echo MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This test is useful when performed specifically for evaluation for a vestibular schwannoma, not as a general screen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three major treatment options for patients with a vestibular schwannoma are surgery, radiation therapy, and observation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery generally results in satisfactory long term control of vestibular schwannomas; however, one group has reported a 10 year recurrence rate for partially resected schwannomas of 20 percent and a similar rate for incompletely resected tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953390685\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three standard operative approaches. Selection of a particular approach is determined by a number of factors, including the size of the tumor and whether or not preservation of hearing is a consideration.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retromastoid suboccipital (retrosigmoid) &ndash; The suboccipital approach can be used for any size tumor with or without attempted hearing preservation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Translabyrinthine &ndash; The translabyrinthine approach has been recommended for acoustic tumors larger than 3 cm and for smaller tumors when hearing preservation is not an issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Middle fossa &ndash; The middle fossa approach is suitable for small (&lt;1.5 cm) tumors when hearing preservation is a goal.</p><p/><p>In many institutions, a team consisting of a neurosurgeon and an otologist perform the procedure. The experience of both the surgeon and the hospital are important in optimizing the surgical outcome and minimizing the risk of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953390863\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete tumor removal is feasible in almost all patients and there are few if any recurrences when tumor removal is complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. However, the outcome is less favorable in patients who undergo subtotal removal in an attempt to preserve anatomical continuity of the facial or acoustic nerves. Regrowth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrence, which is usually asymptomatic, occurs in up to 15 percent of cases when initial resection is incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>The likelihood of surgical morbidity, which includes hearing loss, facial weakness, and vestibular disturbances, depends upon tumor size. Facial nerve function can be preserved in most patients even with large tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/30,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33,34</a>], and serviceable hearing can be preserved in many patients. However, only rarely does hearing improve after vestibular schwannoma surgery. Intraoperative facial nerve and auditory monitoring have alerted surgeons to potential injury, thereby improving the final outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The outcomes that are achievable with an experienced team can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series of 179 patients, 97 to 99 percent of patients had complete tumor removal without evidence of recurrence at a mean follow-up duration of 70 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Normal or near normal facial movement was present in 94 to 97 percent of patients with small tumors and 28 to 57 percent with large tumors; in addition, 45 to 82 percent of patients with good hearing and small tumors retained their hearing. Treatment complications consisted mainly of cerebrospinal fluid leakage which occurred in 15 percent of patients; there were two deaths (1 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results were noted in another report of 1000 tumors treated at a single institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Ninety-eight percent of tumors were completely removed; in the other 21 patients, deliberate partial removal was performed in severely ill patients for decompression of the brainstem or in an attempt to preserve hearing in the last hearing ear. Anatomic preservation of the facial nerve and the cochlear nerve was achieved in 93 and 68 percent, respectively. Major neurologic complications included tetraparesis in one patient, hemiparesis in 1 percent, lower cranial nerve palsies in 5.5 percent, and cerebrospinal fluid fistulas in 9.2 percent. There were 11 deaths (1.1 percent) occurring at 2 to 69 days postoperatively.</p><p/><p>Persistent headaches are another significant complication following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In a quality of life analysis of 1657 patients treated surgically, 46 percent reported headaches occurring more than once a day, and these were often severe enough to cause disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The headaches eventually resolved in about one-half. Postoperative headaches were more commonly associated with the retrosigmoid surgical approach, and tended to be more frequent and severe in women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953390905\"><span class=\"h3\">Other complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of complications in addition to damage to cranial nerves VII and VIII are associated with microsurgery. These were analyzed in a literature review that included over 32,000 patients who underwent surgical resection of a vestibular schwannoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall mortality rate was 0.2 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid leaks were observed in 8.5 percent, of which one-third resolved with conservative treatment. This complication was significantly more frequent in patients who underwent a translabyrinthine approach, although at least one report has suggested that technical modifications can decrease this complication with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In a retrospective study using the National Inpatient Sample database in the United States for vestibular schwannoma surgeries from the year 2002 to 2010 (n = 4147), adults &ge;65 years of age were at increased risk for medical complications such as acute cardiac events, renal failure, and infection (adjusted OR 1.8) as well as in-hospital mortality (OR 13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy approaches that have been used in patients with vestibular schwannoma include stereotactic radiosurgery, stereotactic radiotherapy, and proton beam therapy, as well as conventional fractionated radiation therapy. </p><p>There are no randomized trials comparing different radiation therapy approaches, and data are only available from observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A critical review of the literature concluded that equivalent local control can be achieved with each of these approaches and that treatment decisions could be based upon the availability of expertise and technology, as well as patient specific factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Stereotactic radiosurgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a technique that utilizes multiple convergent beams to deliver a high single dose of radiation to a radiographically discrete treatment volume, thereby minimizing injury to adjacent structures. This can be accomplished with either the gamma knife or a linear accelerator. Radiosurgery is a viable treatment option for selected patients with smaller tumors (&lt;3 cm) or for enlarging tumors in patients who are not candidates for surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Early single-center experience indicated that marginal treatment doses of up to 22 Gy yielded excellent local control rates (&gt;95 percent) with up to 10 years of follow-up; however, cranial nerve toxicities, including hearing preservation rates as low as 40 percent at two years and trigeminal or facial nerve palsies in up to one third of patients, indicated a need for dose reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>].</p><p>Subsequent single-center studies using a marginal dose of 12 to 13 Gy to treat tumors up to 3 cm in diameter have reported local control rates of 91 to 100 percent at 10 years and trigeminal or facial nerve complication rates below five percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although hearing preservation rates of 60 to 70 percent were initially described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], longer-term follow-up studies indicate that rates of functional hearing preservation decline to approximately 25 percent at 10 years, even with contemporary treatment doses of 12 to 13 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. Risk factors for worse hearing outcomes include older age, larger tumor volume, and greater degree of baseline hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. The impact of cochlear radiation dose alone as a predictive parameter for hearing outcomes remains controversial. While several retrospective studies have reported improved hearing preservation with maximum cochlear dose &lt;4 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], or central cochlear dose &lt;4.2 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], others have not found cochlear dose to be a significant factor on multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Other potential complications include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic degeneration &ndash; Delayed cyst formation has been reported in two percent of patients, occurring at a median of six years after SRS and requiring craniotomy for symptomatic management in a small minority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-radiation tumor expansion &ndash; An increase in tumor diameter of &gt;2 mm (with median tumor volume increase of 75 percent) has been reported in 14 percent of patients at a median of nine months following radiosurgery, of which one third remain enlarged with no sequential growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Reports on the use of SRS in patients with NF2 have shown variable results, and long-term follow-up is lacking. Treatment of vestibular schwannomas in patients with NF2 is discussed in more detail separately.

For patients treated with SRT, the median dose was 57.6 Gy, given in 1.8 Gy fractions. At a median follow-up of 75 months, the 5- and 10-year local control rates were both 96 percent and there was no significant difference between the two treatment techniques. In patients with serviceable hearing prior to SRT, the hearing preservation rate was 78 percent at five years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another single institution series using a different schedule, 496 patients were treated at a single institution between 1995 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. A dose of 25 Gy in five fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions was used (89 and 11 percent of cases, respectively). Analysis of the 385 patients with imaging follow-up at least 18 months after diagnosis found a therapeutic failure rate of 3 percent, as defined by progressive tumor growth requiring surgical intervention. However, 30 percent of these patients experienced some tumor growth, and 9 percent had a long-term twofold or greater increase in tumor volume after treatment. Patients with a small tumor (volume less than 1 cm<sup>3</sup>) were more likely to experience tumor growth than those with larger tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Proton beam therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proton beam therapy may provide maximal local tumor control while minimizing cranial nerve injuries. The physical characteristics of the beam result in the majority of the energy being deposited at the end of a linear track (the Bragg peak), with the dose falling rapidly to zero beyond the Bragg peak. Thus, the use of proton beam therapy permits the delivery of high doses of RT to the target volume while limiting the &quot;scatter&quot; dose received by surrounding tissues.</p><p>In one report of 88 patients who were treated with fractionated proton beam therapy, the two- and five-year local control rates were 95 and 94 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Salvage therapy was necessary in five (radiosurgery in one, craniotomy in one, and shunting for hydrocephalus in three). Seven of 21 patients with functional hearing retained serviceable hearing ability, while facial and trigeminal nerve function was preserved in 91 and 89 percent of patients, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since vestibular schwannomas are typically slow growing, observation with follow-up MRI scans every 6 to 12 months may be warranted in carefully selected patients. </p><p>The growth rate of untreated tumors during observation was illustrated by a single institution series of 386 patients who were initially managed with observation between 1990 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Patients were reimaged at one year and subsequently followed based upon rate of growth. Indications for conservative management varied but included age &gt;60 years, significant comorbidity, small tumor size, lack of symptoms, risk of further hearing loss, or patient preference. Overall, 59 percent of patients had an annual tumor growth rate &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year,</span> although 39 patients (12 percent) had tumor growth &ge;3 mm at one year.</p><p>A review of the literature identified 21 studies that included 1345 patients who were managed conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. With an average follow-up of 3.2 years, 43 percent of tumors showed evidence of growth, 51 percent remained stable, while 6 percent had evidence of regression without treatment. Hearing loss occurred in one-half of the 347 individuals in whom it was assessed longitudinally. In 15 of the studies, 20 percent of 1001 individuals eventually required treatment with either surgery or radiation, due to either tumor growth on imaging or symptom progression.</p><p>Observation may be particularly appropriate in elderly patients who are poor candidates for immediate intervention.
