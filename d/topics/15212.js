Its pathogenesis is poorly understood, but is heterogeneous and both genetic factors affecting insulin release and responsiveness and environmental factors, such as obesity, are important.</p><p>The prevalence of and risk factors for type 2 diabetes will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, including genetic susceptibility, and the diagnostic criteria for diabetes are discussed elsewhere.

Among adults in the United States, the estimated overall prevalence of diabetes ranges from 12 to 14 percent, depending on the criteria used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An analysis of data from the National Health Interview Survey found a doubling in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes from 1990 to 2008, with no significant change during 2008 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other national databases, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), have reported an increase in the prevalence of diabetes over two decades (from 9.8 to 12.4 percent), but have confirmed the relatively stable (approximately 12 percent) prevalence between 2008 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Given the marked increase in childhood obesity, there is concern that the prevalence of diabetes will continue to increase substantially. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition; epidemiology; and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of diabetes is higher in certain populations. Using data from a national survey for people aged 20 years or older, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the United States (2010 to 2012) was 7.6 percent in non-Hispanic whites, 9.0 percent in Asian Americans, 12.8 percent in Hispanics, 13.2 percent in non-Hispanic blacks, and 15.9 percent in American <span class=\"nowrap\">Indians/Alaska</span> Natives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In an analysis of data from the 2011 to 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the prevalence of self-reported diabetes was higher among Asians (9.9 percent) and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders (14.3 percent) than in white individuals (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Outside the United States, type 2 diabetes is most prevalent in Polynesia and other Pacific islands (approximately 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. In a 2010 cross-sectional survey of almost 100,000 adults in China, the prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 11.6 percent, whereas the prevalence of prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT], impaired fasting glucose [IFG], or A1C between 5.7 and 6.4 percent) was 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9730757\"><span class=\"h1\">ABNORMAL GLUCOSE METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes is high, our ability to predict type 2 diabetes in the general population is limited. However, abnormal glucose metabolism can be documented years before the onset of overt diabetes. Although the risk of developing type 2 diabetes follows a continuum across all levels of abnormal glycemia, when classified categorically, the individuals demonstrably at highest risk include those with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or a glycated hemoglobin (A1C) level of 5.7 to 6.4 percent (39 to 46 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82479 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The criteria for defining diabetes and impaired glucose regulation are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the natural history of IFG and IGT is variable, approximately 25 percent of subjects with either will progress to diabetes over three to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Individuals with additional diabetes clinical risk factors, including obesity and family history, are more likely to develop diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H9730393\" class=\"local\">'Clinical risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9730764\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired glucose tolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term IGT describes subjects who, during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), have blood glucose values between those in normal subjects and those in patients with overt diabetes (140 to 199 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [7.8 to 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82479 \">table 1</a>). The rate of progression from IGT to overt diabetes varies among different populations. In six prospective studies, for example, the incidence rates of type 2 diabetes among patients with IGT ranged from 36 to 87 per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The rates were higher among Hispanic, Pima, and Nauruan people than among whites. Estimates of obesity (including body mass index [BMI], waist-to-hip ratio, and waist circumference) were positively associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes. In contrast, sex and family history of diabetes were not related to the rate of progression in most studies.</p><p>Subjects who have only IGT generally do not develop the microvascular complications of diabetes such as retinopathy and nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. They are, however, at substantially increased risk (when compared with matched subjects with normal glucose tolerance) for developing macrovascular disease (such as coronary artery disease).

IFG increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Although fasting glucose levels less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> (5.55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> are considered normal by the 2003 criteria of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, subjects with fasting glucose values in the higher quintiles of normal range are also at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. In a prospective cohort study (over 46,500 subjects followed for a mean of 81 months), the overall incidence of diabetes in those with normal fasting glucose was low (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, there was an increased risk of diabetes incidence in those with fasting plasma glucose of 95 to 99 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.3 to 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> compared with &lt;85 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (hazard ratio [HR] 2.33, 95% CI 1.95-2.79) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Similar results were reported in a study of 13,163 healthy male Israeli army recruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The risk of diabetes was even greater (HR 8.23, 95% CI 3.6-19.0) in those with high normal glucose levels (91 to 99 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> in combination with elevated serum triglycerides (greater than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and elevated BMI (&gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> and may indicate subjects for whom preventive measures would be most effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9730778\"><span class=\"h2\">IGT or IFG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The finding that some individuals have isolated IGT or IFG suggests that there are different pathophysiologic mechanisms causing the abnormalities in glucose homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Individuals with isolated IFG have hepatic insulin resistance, whereas those with isolated IGT predominantly have muscle insulin resistance and normal or slightly reduced hepatic insulin sensitivity. Subjects with abnormalities in both tests have hepatic and muscle insulin resistance, which confers an increased risk of progressing to diabetes compared with having only one abnormality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9730785\"><span class=\"h2\">Glycated hemoglobin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A1C measurements are also helpful in predicting diabetes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82479 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16-18</a>]. In a systematic review of 16 prospective studies examining the relationship between A1C and future incidence of diabetes mellitus, risk of diabetes increased sharply with A1C across the range of 5 to 6.5 percent (31 to 48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. For persons with A1C between 5.5 to 6.0 percent and 6.0 to 6.5 percent, the projected five-year risk of diabetes ranged from 9 to 25 and 25 to 50 percent, respectively. In the largest prospective cohort study of 26,563 women without diagnosed diabetes followed for 10 years, baseline A1C, at levels considered to be within the normal range, was an independent predictor of future type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The risk of type 2 diabetes is higher (five- to sixfold) in those with both a maternal and paternal history of type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The risk is likely mediated through genetic, anthropometric (body mass index [BMI], waist circumference), and lifestyle (diet, physical activity, smoking) factors. The genetics of type 2 diabetes is reviewed separately.

In an analysis of 2011 to 2012 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the age-standardized prevalence of total diabetes (using the A1C, fasting plasma glucose, or two-hour oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] definition) was higher among non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic individuals (21.8, 20.6, and 22.6 percent, respectively) than among non-Hispanic white individuals (11.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The ethnic disparity in diabetes incidence may be related in part to modifiable risk factors. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of a cohort study of 4251 black and white young adults without diabetes at baseline (median follow-up 30 years), the racial disparity in diabetes risk was primarily associated with biological risk factors (eg, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure) but also with neighborhood, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors during young adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes rises with increasing body weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79316\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79316 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In an analysis of five NHANES spanning over thirty years, increase in BMI over time was the most important of the three covariates studied (age, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> BMI) for the increase in diabetes prevalence, accounting for approximately 50 percent of the increase in diabetes prevalence in men and 100 percent in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Adjustment for weight gain and leukocyte count (a surrogate marker of systemic inflammation) attenuated the excess risk in recent quitters.

Compared with approximately eight <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day</span> of sleep, short (&le;5 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day)</span> and long (&gt;8 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day)</span> duration of sleep were significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (RR 1.28 and 1.48, respectively). Difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep were also associated with an increased incidence.

The effect was largely attenuated by adjusting for BMI and waist-to-hip ratio (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82-1.42).</p><p>Whether the putative association between disordered sleep and development of diabetes is causal or not is unknown. Since the association loses statistical significance after adjusting for obesity, it is not clear if there is a unique relationship between sleep patterns and diabetes risk, whether sleep disruption associated with obesity (eg, sleep apnea) has some pernicious effects on diabetes risk, or whether other mechanisms may play a role in diabetes development. One possible mechanism whereby short sleep duration increases the risk of diabetes is through its effect on melatonin secretion. Sleep disruption is associated with decreased melatonin secretion, and in an observational study, lower melatonin secretion was independently associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

It is important to recognize that most studies have used food frequency questionnaires to capture dietary patterns and that none of the food stuffs examined can be considered in isolation. For example, higher meat intake always means more saturated fat intake, relatively lower fruit and vegetable intake, and frequently, higher body mass index (BMI).

Carriers of an rs6257 allele had lower plasma levels of SHBG and increased risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas carriers of an rs6259 variant allele had higher plasma levels and lower risk.

The simple clinical model included information typically available at clinic evaluations, such as age, parental history of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Each of the metabolic syndrome traits (elevated blood pressure and triglyceride concentrations, low HDL levels, and IFG), obesity, and parental history were highly associated with developing diabetes.
