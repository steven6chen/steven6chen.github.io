Weakness is partly a consequence of improved survival in patients with multiorgan failure and sepsis, but may be associated with treatments administered in the intensive care unit (ICU).</p><p>Neuromuscular weakness in the ICU is most often due to critical illness myopathy, critical illness polyneuropathy, or a combination of the two. This topic will review the peripheral neuromuscular disorders of critical illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2034067156\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuromuscular weakness in the intensive care unit (ICU) is most often due to critical illness myopathy, critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), or a combination of the two. Some authors apply the term &quot;intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW)&quot; for patients who have clinically detected weakness with no plausible cause other than critical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>It is likely that reduction of nerve excitability (ie, inactivation of sodium channels) and axon degeneration (the currently accepted mechanism of CIP) may represent different ends of a single pathophysiologic spectrum that varies according to the severity of the inflammatory process in CIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and that muscle membrane inexcitability, myosin loss, and muscle necrosis comprise the pathophysiologic spectrum in critical illness myopathy (CIM).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333872501\"><span class=\"h2\">Critical illness myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common form of ICU-acquired myopathy is CIM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This disorder is also known by other names, including acute quadriplegic myopathy and thick filament myopathy.</p><p>The major histopathologic finding in CIM is relatively selective loss of myosin, which can be identified as a lack of reactivity to myosin ATPase in non-necrotic fibers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F114522\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114522 \">figure 1</a>). This finding can be confirmed with immunohistochemical studies for myosin and by utilizing electron microscopy to identify loss of thick filaments.</p><p>There is usually atrophy of myofibers, type 2 more than type 1. There is often evidence of myofibrillar disorganization, which may be partly manifested as abnormal basophilic stippling on hematoxylin and eosin stains, purplish staining with Gomori trichrome, and irregular clumping of the reaction product with NADH-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR). Some degree of necrosis may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>In humans, there is evidence that several processes are involved in the pathogenesis of CIM, including upregulation of calpain, an increase in muscle apoptosis, activation of the proteosome ubiquitin-degradative system, stimulation of the transforming growth <span class=\"nowrap\">factor-beta/mitogen-activated</span> protein kinase <span class=\"nowrap\">(TGF-beta/MAPK)</span> pathway, and upregulation of serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Oxidative stress may also play a role in the development of CIM, as illustrated by the finding that sarcolemmal immunostaining of the nitric oxide synthase isoform NOS1 was reduced or absent in six patients with CIM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. While the significance of this finding is not clear, it is hypothesized that the loss of sarcolemmal NOS1 could lead to muscle fiber inexcitability by reducing nitric oxide release at the muscle membrane.</p><p>A steroid-denervation animal model reproduces the histopathologic and electrophysiologic findings of CIM in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and suggests that a deleterious interaction between glucocorticoids and denervation leads to a depletion of the mRNA for myosin, and to muscle atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Muscle sodium channel properties were also evaluated in a chronic sepsis animal model produced by needle perforation after cecal ligature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patch clamp technique revealed decreased sodium current that could lead to muscle inexcitability. However, muscle histopathology and nerve conduction studies were not assessed in this model, so it is unknown if there was neuropathy or structural myopathy with myosin loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3934991076\"><span class=\"h2\">Critical illness polyneuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second neuromuscular condition that is commonly acquired in the ICU is CIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/4,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14-16</a>]. This disorder was first recognized clinically in the late 1970s and 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Critical illness polyneuropathy appears to be a common complication of severe sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>] and is thought to represent a neurologic manifestation of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). There is some correlation with elevations in blood glucose and reductions in serum albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-sepsis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of sepsis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism of axonal injury in CIP is unknown. However, speculation focuses on injury to the microcirculation of distal nerves, causing ischemia and axonal degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. During the early stages of sepsis, electrical inexcitability due to sodium channel inactivation may be present in otherwise intact nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2726861728\" class=\"local\">'Combined critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy'</a> below.)</p><p>The association of sepsis with CIP is illustrated by a prospective report that assessed electrophysiologic and clinical data from 43 patients an average of 28 days after the onset of sepsis and multiorgan failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. An axonal polyneuropathy was present in 30 patients (70 percent), 15 of whom also had clinical evidence of generalized muscle dysfunction, characterized by limb muscle weakness, reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation. Three severely affected patients were unable to move any of their extremities, failed to improve, and ultimately died.</p><p>Many patients with severe sepsis who develop neuromuscular weakness in the ICU have a combination of CIM and CIP. (See <a href=\"#H2726861728\" class=\"local\">'Combined critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2726861728\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ICU-acquired weakness sometimes have a combination of both CIM and CIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/4,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23,24</a>]. This combined disorder has also been termed critical illness polyneuromyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Sepsis may be a common pathologic mechanism underlying the development of both CIM and CIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although not established, sepsis may trigger reversible but prolonged electrical inexcitability of nerve, similar in concept to the electrical inexcitability of muscle that has been observed in patients with CIM. (See <a href=\"#H4167027795\" class=\"local\">'Electrodiagnostic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>In a septic rat model, there were reduced mixed motor and sensory tail nerve amplitudes and reduced excitability in dorsal root sensory axons via intracellular recordings. These experiments indicated that sodium channels were inactivated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The investigators interpreted these data as evidence of either a novel neuropathy in critical illness or an acquired sodium channelopathy that causes neuropathy early in the course of CIP and may be reversible without progressing to axonal degeneration. In conjunction with studies in CIM, the data further suggest that the acquired sodium channelopathy in critical illness affects different sodium channel isoforms in both nerve and muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2863159186\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolonged neuromuscular junction blockade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prolonged neuromuscular junction blockade is almost never encountered in the modern era because the use of paralytic agents has been largely replaced by the use of sedatives in the ICU. The disorder is related to prolonged use (days) of paralytic agents, often in the setting of renal or hepatic insufficiency, leading to prolonged circulation of drug metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. These curare-like paralytic agents bind reversibly to acetylcholine receptors on the motor end-plates of neuromuscular junctions, thereby inhibiting neuromuscular transmission. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-critically-ill-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2037001446\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuromuscular weakness due to critical illness myopathy (CIM) or critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is a common occurrence in patients who are critically ill, developing in &ge;25 percent of patients who are mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit (ICU) for at least seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. Risk factors include sepsis, multiorgan failure, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome.</p><p>In prospective studies, approximately one-third of patients with status asthmaticus or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 7 percent who receive a liver transplant develop CIM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/30,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33,34</a>]. Patients with other critical illnesses, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, may also be affected.</p><p>Earlier studies suggested that the main risk factor for CIM was the use of intravenous glucocorticoids in the intensive care unit setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/5,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,33-36</a>]. However, the glucocorticoid association is now controversial, and critically ill patients may develop CIM in the absence of exposure to intravenous glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>].</p><p>Another potential risk factor for CIM is the use of various types of paralytic agents, and a meta-analysis of ICU-weakness in general suggests a modest association between neuromuscular blocking agents and neuromuscular dysfunction associated with critical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Associated and perhaps triggering factors may include a higher illness severity index, hyperglycemia, and hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/30,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,43</a>].

A reduction of &gt;25 percent in the peroneal motor amplitude (compound muscle action potential) was the most useful measure, with the best combination of sensitivity and specificity (100 and 67 percent, respectively). In some patients, the transition to <span class=\"nowrap\">CIM/CIP</span> was abrupt (ie, within 24 hours). In others, it occurred over days. In this study, CIM <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CIP were associated with multiorgan failure but not with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, drugs, or nutrition. The simplified electrophysiologic test used in this study was not able to distinguish CIM from CIP, and the investigators suggested performing a complete electrodiagnostic evaluation for patients with a &gt;25 percent reduction from baseline in the peroneal compound muscle action potential on two consecutive days. The utility of this peroneal nerve test was validated in another prospective <span class=\"nowrap\">CIM/CIP</span> study with sensitivity of 100 percent and specificity of 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3653537045\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common features of critical illness myopathy (CIM) and critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) include symmetric, flaccid limb weakness and ventilatory muscle weakness. Extraocular muscles are relatively spared, and facial muscles are usually but not always spared. Tendon reflexes are often reduced, especially with CIP. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CIM</strong> often begins several days of intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Deep tendon reflexes may be normal or attenuated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CIP</strong> usually occurs in patients who are in the ICU for one or especially two weeks or more. The clinical features can overlap with those of critical illness myopathy.

Some investigators use the MRC sum score, which involves testing the strength of three movements from each arm (shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, wrist extension) and each leg (hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion), yielding a maximum combined score of 60; a combined score of &lt;48 is considered diagnostic of ICU-acquired weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Similarly, a mean MRC score of &lt;4 per muscle group is consistent with ICU-acquired weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/1,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,51</a>]. However, manual muscle testing may not be practical in the ICU if encephalopathy and pain limit voluntary muscle contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This limitation may also make it difficult or impossible to reliably exclude a central nervous system problem as the cause of generalized weakness. It may be helpful to temporarily interrupt sedatives and analgesics, if doing so does not compromise patient safety, to facilitate the neurologic evaluation.</p><p>CIM can be distinguished from CIP if preservation of sensory function (indicative of the former) can be demonstrated. However, like strength testing, sensory evaluation can be difficult in critically ill patients, particularly when obtunded, comatose, or intubated, and it may be difficult to distinguish CIM from CIP on the basis of clinical features and neurologic examination findings alone. Furthermore, some patients have features of combined CIM and CIP. (See <a href=\"#H2726861728\" class=\"local\">'Combined critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3864996239\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroimaging is indicated if the neurologic assessment of weakness is unreliable, or if the evaluation reveals evidence that raises suspicion for a central nervous system lesion.

An elevation in serum creatine kinase is usually present with CIM and supports the diagnosis but can occur in the absence of CIM among patients treated with intravenous glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In a prospective study of 25 patients with status asthmaticus who were treated with intravenous glucocorticoids, 9 patients had clinically detectable myopathy, while 19 had an elevated serum CK, with a median value of 1575 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> (range 66 to 7430 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Examples include infectious or immune-mediated encephalitides, myelopathies, and the acute motor axonal neuropathy form of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). In the latter case, a normal CSF protein level would be supportive of CIP rather than GBS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electroencephalography (EEG) is appropriate in patients with altered consciousness to evaluate for seizures (particularly nonconvulsive or subclinical seizures) and certain metabolic encephalopathies (eg, hepatic) or infectious encephalitides (eg, viral) that have characteristic EEG patterns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle biopsy is rarely performed unless another treatable condition, such as an inflammatory myopathy, is in the differential diagnosis. For patients with CIM or combined CIM and CIP, muscle biopsy and histopathology can confirm the presence of myopathy.

Electrodiagnostic testing with NCS and EMG can help to confirm the diagnosis of CIM, CIP, or combined <span class=\"nowrap\">CIM/CIP</span>. Additionally, electrodiagnostic studies can help to identify other causes of weakness in the differential diagnosis; examples include GBS, motor neuron disease, and myasthenia gravis.</p><p>However, electrodiagnostic studies have important limitations including lack of universal ICU availability, particularly outside of tertiary centers, and reduced utility in patients who lack the ability to voluntarily contract muscles, are encephalopathic, or have severe weakness or peripheral edema. Differentiating CIM from CIP may not change management, but may impact prognosis. The presence of neuropathy with or without myopathy portends a worse prognosis than myopathy in most studies. (See <a href=\"#H1085798267\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In the author's clinical experience, a normal NCS study by day seven or so would rule out CIM and CIP.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In CIM, abnormalities on NCS and EMG are seen within a few days following onset of weakness. The major nerve conduction findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76493 \">table 2</a>) are normal to low motor amplitudes with frequent broadening (prolonged duration) of the compound muscle action potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/47,53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,53-57</a>]; these findings are essentially diagnostic of CIM Phrenic motor amplitudes may also be low. Sensory responses are normal or only mildly reduced, unless there is a coexisting polyneuropathy. Rarely, neuromuscular junction blockade occurs and can be identified transiently via low rates of repetitive stimulation that reveal a decremental response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Needle examination often (in &gt;70 percent) but not uniformly reveals fibrillation potential activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Depending upon the degree of weakness, observation of the recruitment of motor unit potentials (MUPs) may be difficult. When it is possible to evaluate, recruitment tends to be early. MUPs are short in duration, low in amplitude, and sometimes polyphasic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some muscles exhibit electrical inexcitability to direct muscle stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. This inexcitability is due to a defect in muscle membrane depolarization, which may be related to increased inactivation of sodium channels at the resting potential. Direct muscle stimulation is especially useful in differentiating CIM from motor axonopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76493 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/48,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,54,55</a>]. However, some patients also have a coexisting peripheral neuropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Direct muscle stimulation can be performed using a stimulating monopolar needle electrode placed just proximal to the tendon insertion. The tibialis anterior muscle is commonly tested. After obtaining a muscle twitch, a recording needle electrode is placed in the center of the muscle proximal to the site of stimulation, and the maximal muscle-stimulated compound muscle action potential (mCMAP) is recorded. The recording electrode is kept in place and the appropriate nerve undergoes surface stimulation, recording a nerve-evoked compound muscle action potential (nCMAP). The nCMAP to mCMAP ratio is calculated; a value &gt;0.5 suggests impaired muscle membrane excitability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/60,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,62,63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In CIP, electrodiagnostic studies in patients with CIP typically reveal findings consistent with a generalized axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy with low motor and sensory amplitudes on NCS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55570\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55570 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/54,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,64</a>]. Over two to three weeks, fibrillation potentials will be evident on electromyography (EMG) needle examination. Phrenic motor amplitudes are commonly reduced. Some patients appear to have predominant motor involvement, but myopathy should be excluded in such patients. Demyelination is not seen in CIP and would be an exclusion to the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with CIP, direct muscle stimulation using a needle electrode elicits a relatively higher amplitude response compared with the response recorded from muscle after nerve stimulation. In contrast, in critical illness myopathy, there are proportionally low direct muscle- and nerve-evoked responses.</p><p/><p>The development of CIM and CIP was illustrated by a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 48 patients who had baseline neurologic examinations and NCS within 72 hours of developing severe sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Electromyography was performed for patients who developed clinical weakness or had a &ge;30 percent reduction in nerve conduction response amplitudes. Clinical and electrophysiologic examinations were repeated weekly for the duration of the ICU stay. Abnormal NCS were present at baseline in 63 percent of patients, and an abnormality on baseline NCS was significantly associated with hospital mortality compared with a normal baseline NCS (55 versus 0 percent, respectively). In 20 patients who remained in the ICU long enough to have serial NCS, neuromuscular dysfunction developed in 10 patients (50 percent). Electrophysiologic evidence of both CIM and CIP was present in 8 of 10 patients with neuromuscular dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The broad differential diagnosis of acute generalized weakness in a critically ill patient includes bilateral or paramedian brain or brainstem lesions, disorders of the spinal cord, peripheral nerve lesions, neuromuscular junction disorders, and muscle disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F114822\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114822 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>However, in a critically ill patient who develops flaccid generalized weakness, the major considerations in the differential diagnosis are critical illness myopathy (CIM), critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), or a combination of the two.

In a subset of patients who had serial muscle biopsy, there were decreases in the muscle fiber cross-sectional area and the ratio of protein to DNA, consistent with loss of muscle mass, while studies of protein metabolism and signaling suggested decreased muscle synthesis and increased muscle breakdown. The muscle loss was greater in those with multiorgan failure and occurred despite enteral nutrition. Biopsy specimens showed muscle necrosis in approximately 50 percent of patients, suggesting they might be categorized as having critical illness myopathy (see <a href=\"#H2333872501\" class=\"local\">'Critical illness myopathy'</a> above) rather than cachectic myopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome) is an uncommon occurrence in critically ill patients.

The most common causes are critical illness myopathy (CIM), critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), or a combination of the two. Risk factors include sepsis, multiorgan failure, and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The use of intravenous glucocorticoids is another possible risk factor for CIM. (See <a href=\"#H2034067156\" class=\"local\">'Classification and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical features of CIM and CIP include symmetric, flaccid limb weakness, which is usually worse in proximal compared with distal muscles. Extraocular muscles are relatively spared, and facial muscles are usually but not always spared. (See <a href=\"#H3653537045\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness is suspected in patients who develop flaccid muscle weakness and ventilatory failure after the onset of critical illness. In the appropriate setting, the diagnosis is confirmed when other, unrelated causes of weakness are excluded or deemed unlikely (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F114822\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114822 \">table 1</a>). However, it is often difficult to distinguish CIM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76493 \">table 2</a>) from CIP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55570\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55570 \">table 3</a>) on the basis of clinical features and neurologic examination findings alone. Neuroimaging is indicated if the neurologic assessment of weakness is unreliable, or if the evaluation reveals evidence that raises suspicion for a central nervous system lesion. We suggest electrodiagnostic testing with nerve conduction studies (NCS), electromyography (EMG), and repetitive nerve stimulation for all patients who have unexplained severe weakness, do not improve over one to two weeks, or cannot be reliably assessed by clinical examination. Differentiating CIM from CIP may not change management, but may impact prognosis.
