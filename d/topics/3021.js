Thus, a principal goal of any procedure to reduce the frequency of AF is to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins so that these discharges do not activate atrial tissue. Complete isolation of a pulmonary vein is accomplished when there is both entrance and exit block, commonly known as bidirectional block. Entrance block is accomplished when a stimulus delivered in the left atrium does not enter the pulmonary vein. Exit block is present when a spontaneous or paced impulse within the pulmonary vein fails to exit the view into the atrium.</p><p>This first portion of this topic will focus on the anatomic and pathophysiologic basis of AF. This information is relevant to how catheter ablation (CA) techniques might reduce the burden of AF, thereby decreasing symptoms and in some cases reducing the likelihood of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

In patients with paroxysmal AF, pulmonary vein triggers are the primary stimulus in most cases.

In addition, it is thought that mechanisms that maintain rather than trigger the arrhythmia are more important in these individuals. These observations may explain the reduced efficacy of CA procedures that are limited to PV isolation in patients with longstanding persistent AF seen in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In these patients, additional lesions are needed to prevent recurrence of AF. These lesions are often placed in the left atrial posterior wall and roof. Some patients with persistent AF have triggers in the left atrial appendage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, other data suggest no additional benefit of producing additional lesion sets for the treatment of persistent AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048677506\"><span class=\"h1\">ENERGY SOURCES USED FOR ABLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct current (DC) energy, delivered during general anesthesia, was the initial energy source used for catheter ablation of the atrioventricular node to induce complete heart block in patients with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response. However, DC shock ablation, or fulguration, never achieved widespread use because of a high incidence of complications related to the high energy discharge. The procedure has not been used for many years and is of only historical interest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048677518\"><span class=\"h2\">RF energy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiofrequency (RF) energy (low voltage, high frequency electrical energy [30 KHz to 1.5 MHz]) is delivered with a catheter to the endocardial surface. RF energy produces controlled focal tissue ablation, as compared with the more extensive damage caused by DC fulguration. Since RF energy does not directly stimulate nerves or myocardium, the procedure is usually relatively painless and general anesthesia is not necessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048677600\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryothermal energy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even though RF energy is relatively safe, other energy sources have been evaluated in an attempt to improve safety. Cryothermal ablation offers the potential benefit of reversible cold mapping: If mild cooling has the intended effect, more profound freezing can inflict permanent tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. If limited cooling has an untoward effect or no effect at all, the tissue is allowed to thaw without permanent damage. Point-by-point cryothermal ablation is not usually used in AF ablation given the duration required to deliver an adequate lesion. &#160;</p><p>The release of a cryoablation balloon that delivers a circumferential lesion at the antrum of the PV has made the technology available for the treatment of paroxysmal AF. This technology may reduce procedure times and reduce the risk of complications related to RF energy, specifically thrombus formation at the lesion site and cardiac perforation due to direct catheter-related trauma or excessive heating at the catheter-tissue interface. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048676398\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY VEIN ISOLATION PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various methods of catheter ablation have been used, and most focus on isolating the triggers in the pulmonary veins (PVs) from the vulnerable substrate in the left atrium. The majority of ablations performed use radiofrequency energy or cryothermy (cryoballoon ablation). The most common technique is circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). (See <a href=\"#H1048676576\" class=\"local\">'Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048676404\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging and mapping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most complicated nonsurgical procedures used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, and requires sophisticated adjunctive tools to localize both the appropriate anatomy and the electrical targets for ablation while minimizing complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Prior to the procedure, most patients undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram to exclude a pre-existing left atrial thrombus and cardiac computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to define the number, size, and location of the PVs. Intracardiac electrograms from multiple bipolar catheters placed within the heart are used to assess the PV potentials that serve as the electrical target of ablation. Fluoroscopy is used to monitor catheter placement throughout the study, though the goal of minimizing radiation exposure has resulted in the adoption of additional non-fluoroscopic imaging modalities. Intracardiac echo (ICE) is used to optimize trans-septal puncture and to provide ongoing surveillance for potential complications, including pericardial effusion and thrombus formation either on the catheters or at ablation sites. Additionally, ICE can be used to assess catheter position, including adequate PV occlusion during cryoballoon ablation. Three-dimensional mapping systems (CARTO Biosense Webster and NAVX St. Jude Medical) are used to define atrial anatomy, assess catheter position, tag lesion sites, and outlined adjacent anatomic structures such as the esophagus. Use of such systems reduces radiation exposure and improves outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-catheter-ablation-of-cardiac-arrhythmias#H19009798\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Electroanatomical mapping'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048676576\"><span class=\"h2\">Circumferential pulmonary vein isolation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circumferential PVI involves the creation of confluent ablation lesions that encircle the ostia of all four PVs, usually in two pairs (ie, a left-circle and a right-sided circle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/18-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-27</a>]. The goal of these lesions is to electrically separate the PVs from the left atrium.</p><p>The circumferential lesion around each PV ostium is created by delivering point-by-point energy. Power, duration, and the catheter contact force (CF) determine the size and the depth of the lesion created in patients undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation. It is generally felt that some lesions create edema but not scar, leading to temporary but not permanent ablation and this ultimately leads to electrical reconnection of the left atrium to the PVs. Greater power, longer duration, and greater CF improve the efficacy of the procedure but lead to an increase in complications such as cardiac perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Duration and power have been easily controlled but CF has required the development of a specialized catheter. </p><p>The TOCCASTAR study randomly assigned 300 patients with symptomatic, drug-refractory, paroxysmal AF to radiofrequency catheter ablation with either a CF-sensing catheter or a non-CF catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The primary effectiveness end point (freedom from recurrent symptomatic atrial arrhythmia off antiarrhythmic drug therapy or the requirement for a second ablation procedure at 12 months) was present in 67.8 and 69.4 percent of patients in the two groups, respectively (p = 0.0073 for non-inferiority). </p><p>A post-hoc analysis found that individuals who received optimal CF, defined as &ge;90 percent of ablations with 10&ge; grams of force, had a higher rate of the primary outcome (75.9 versus 58.1 percent [p = 0.018]). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the primary safety end point (7.2 versus 9.1 percent, respectively). A contact force-sensing catheter has been approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Our recommendations for the use of a CF-sensing catheter are found elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H1135271991\" class=\"local\">'Segmental ostial ablation'</a> below.) Because of the more extensive ablation, this technique may provide additional methods for preventing AF, including autonomic denervation (see <a href=\"#H1142085162\" class=\"local\">'Ablation of cardiac autonomic nerves'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], elimination of triggering foci outside the PVs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and alteration of the left atrial substrate necessary for perpetuating AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, more extensive ablation, particularly in the posterior left atrium, may increase the rate of complications, including the development of left atrial tachycardias or flutters months or years after the ablation. The relative efficacy and safety of these methods is discussed elsewhere.

Electrical isolation can often be accomplished without complete encirclement of the PVs within their ostia.</p><p>In segmental ostial PVI, a circular or &quot;lasso&quot; catheter is placed at the orifice of a PV. Multiple electrodes around the lasso define the precise location of the sites of electrical connection between the PV and the body of the atrium. These connections are ablated near the PV orifice, on the atrial side of the boundary, until no further electrical communication is evident.</p><p>Placement of ablation lesions is guided by both anatomic landmarks and localization of electrical connections between the PVs and left atrium (mapping). Additional ablation lines connecting anatomic structures are sometimes also made during these procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048677055\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of complete isolation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achieving complete conduction block between the PVs and left atrium is the accepted efficacy end point for these procedures.

However, increasing evidence has pointed to an essential role of complete electrical isolation to reduce the recurrence rate and electrical isolation of the PVs is considered the cornerstone of AF ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Recurrent PV conduction explains most cases of recurrence; it is thought to be due to recovery of function of tissue that has been acutely injured (ie, edema and inflammation) but not permanently scarred. Administration of adenosine has been shown to identify PVs with dormant conduction by transiently restoring excitability and conduction across circumferential ablation lines at risk of reconnection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>This technique was utilized in the ADVICE study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. With this technique, PVI is performed in a standard manner. Over the next 20 minutes, there is monitoring for spontaneous PV reconnection. In the absence of spontaneous PV reconnection, intravenous adenosine is administered in an attempt to provoke dormant conduction, defined as the reappearance of PV conduction recorded on a circular mapping catheter for one beat or more.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-atrial-fibrillation#H186294983\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Maintenance of AF'</a>.) The basis for this approach comes from experimental models in which organized reentry circuits (ie, rotors) or focal impulses disorganize into AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The targeted elimination of these localized sources using standard radiofrequency energy in conjunction with a multipolar basket catheter and proprietary mapping software has been shown to be superior to standard ablation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1142085004\"><span class=\"h3\">Complex fractionated atrial electrograms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) are found mostly in areas of slow conduction or at pivot points where wavelets of atrial activation &quot;turn around&quot; at the end of an arc of functional block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These sites, present in either the right or left atrium may be important components of the substrate for maintaining AF and, therefore, could be useful ablation targets. </p><p>The first two reports using this technique differed in their efficacy outcomes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of ablating CFAE sites without PVI was evaluated in 121 patients with either paroxysmal or chronic AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. CFAE sites were identified in the interatrial septum, the PVs, the roof of the LA, the mitral annulus, and the coronary sinus ostium. Ablation of these sites terminated AF in 115 patients (95 percent). At one year, 91 percent were free of arrhythmia and symptoms; 15 percent required a second ablation procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The success rate for this approach in patients with chronic AF was 57 percent at 13 months in a second series of 100 patients with chronic AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p>An observational study evaluated long-term outcomes in 635 high-risk AF patients with paroxysmal, persistent, or chronic AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-technical-considerations/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

In this procedure, only PVs with triggering foci are treated, and if AF remains inducible, sites of fractionated electrograms and high electrogram frequencies in the left atrium and superior vena cava (SVC) are ablated until AF is no longer inducible. This approach was proposed to reduce procedure times, radiation exposure, and the risk of esophageal injury.</p><p>The efficacy of this approach was evaluated in a series of 153 patients with paroxysmal AF. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>47 patients (31 percent) were not inducible after ablation of one or more PVs. The procedure was considered complete in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The remaining 106 patients had further ablations in the left atrium, the coronary sinus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the SVC. Among these patients, an additional 41 patients were not inducible after these ablations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second ablation procedure was required in 28 patients (18 percent) for recurrent AF or, less often, atypical atrial flutter. In 12 of these patients, arrhythmogenic foci were found in PVs that were not previously targeted because triggering foci were not present at the time of the original procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At a mean follow-up of 11 months after the last ablation procedure, 77 percent of patients were free of recurrent AF or atrial flutter and on no antiarrhythmic drugs. Although ambulatory monitoring was offered to all patients, 30 percent did not comply, and therefore recurrence rates were in part defined by symptoms.</p><p/><p>Due to incomplete follow-up monitoring and the absence of a comparative strategy, the efficacy of a tailored approach cannot be directly compared to left atrial ablation or PVI.</p><p>The importance of this study is the emphasis on an approach that is individualized to the type of AF that is detected during atrial mapping. Most studies have applied a uniform, anatomically-based ablation approach to every patient. Furthermore, efforts are underway to develop tools, such as balloon-based catheters, that facilitate a standardized approach, but ignore the underlying electrophysiology. Although optimization of standard approaches will be helpful, some patients can clearly be identified as having focal AF. It is important to identify these patients who can be cured without extensive left atrial ablation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1142085116\"><span class=\"h3\">Rotors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small, vortex-like reentrant circuits called &ldquo;rotors&rdquo; have been identified in experimental models of AF.
