Tamoxifen increases follicle-stimulating hormone levels to a slight degree and estradiol levels to a large degree across the menstrual cycle. It is believed that SERMs like tamoxifen partially block estradiol's negative feedback loop and therefore down-regulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist secretion from the hypothalamus; however, data in humans are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-and-uterine-pathology-in-women-on-tamoxifen-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is common in premenopausal women on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-and-uterine-pathology-in-women-on-tamoxifen-therapy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Tamoxifen appears to promote (1) cell proliferation through MAP kinase pathways, c-MYC, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) pathways, (2) cell proliferation and invasion through alterations in estrogen receptor-alpha and the membrane-associated estrogen receptor G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), (3) cell migration through ERK and Src signaling, (4) DNA damage through DNA adduct formation, and (5) upregulation of the pro-survival unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway.

If there is uncertainty about menopausal status, the patient should be evaluated as a postmenopausal woman. </p><p>In the general population, the diagnosis of menopause is made based upon menstrual history and laboratory testing is typically not required. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-menopause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based on the high prevalence of amenorrhea among women on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, menstrual history is not a reliable method of determining menopausal status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-and-uterine-pathology-in-women-on-tamoxifen-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Fifty percent of premenopausal women treated with tamoxifen will have intermittent or long-term amenorrhea or irregular menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-and-uterine-pathology-in-women-on-tamoxifen-therapy/abstract/4,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9</a>]. Patients may also have chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, but menses may resume. In addition, approximately 20 percent of breast cancer cases in the United States are diagnosed between the ages of 45 to 54 years, and at these ages, many women will be in the menopausal transition and have irregular menses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-and-uterine-pathology-in-women-on-tamoxifen-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>For women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, choice of endocrine therapy depends upon menopausal status, since aromatase inhibitors are used only for postmenopausal women. The approach to determining menopausal status prior to initiating endocrine therapy may differ somewhat from determining menopausal status in women on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> with AUB because the threshold for clinical decision-making and the hormonal milieu are different. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer#H2087745540\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant endocrine therapy for non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Definition of menopause'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>For women on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> with AUB, our clinical approach to determining menopausal status is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> who were already postmenopausal prior to cancer treatment, there is no ambiguity regarding menopausal status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are or who may be premenopausal require determination of menopausal status. It is important to note that the patient's status may have changed since treatment, either as a result of chemotherapy or because time has passed and the patient has entered menopause during the 5 to 10 years of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> therapy. Evaluation of menopausal status includes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The bleeding pattern before cancer treatment, after chemotherapy, and on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> should be determined.

However, new-onset amenorrhea in the setting of tamoxifen does not correlate with low estradiol levels or a decrease in endometrial thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-and-uterine-pathology-in-women-on-tamoxifen-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As such, amenorrhea is not reliable in diagnosing menopause in women on tamoxifen. (See <a href=\"#H3878565528\" class=\"local\">'Medical history'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2910030330\" class=\"local\">'Premenopausal women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients should be asked about whether the AUB has been accompanied by the onset of hot flashes, which may suggest menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. However, there are many etiologies of heat intolerance or sweats that accompany cancer and cancer treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Menopausal status is further evaluated with serum hormone levels. For laboratory testing, we order serum estradiol (E2) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. These remain reliable endocrinologic markers in the setting of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-and-uterine-pathology-in-women-on-tamoxifen-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Tamoxifen slightly raises FSH levels, but typically not to postmenopausal levels. Tamoxifen can raise estradiol levels across the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The results of hormonal testing for menopause should be interpreted with caution in all women, since hormone levels in women of reproductive age or in the menopausal transition may fluctuate dramatically in the same patient over a short period of time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82324\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82324 \">figure 2</a>). In addition, the range may vary by laboratory. Thus, if laboratory results are consistent with menopause, the evaluation of AUB should proceed as in a postmenopausal woman. However, the patient should be counseled that testing is not fully reliable and also that ovarian function may be present between tests or may return at varying intervals following chemotherapy. We interpret laboratory results as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In general, FSH of &ge;70 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span> is consistent with menopause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>FSH of &ge;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span> is consistent with the late menopausal transition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82933 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abnormal-uterine-bleeding-and-uterine-pathology-in-women-on-tamoxifen-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Tamoxifen is associated with increased risks of uterine pathology, including endometrial polyps, endometrial carcinoma and hyperplasia, uterine sarcoma, and uterine carcinosarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H14762924\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> results in a two- to threefold increased risk of endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women at five years; at 10 years, the risk is approximately twice the risk at five years. This risk persists for at least two years after tamoxifen treatment is discontinued. Tamoxifen does not appear to result in an increased endometrial carcinoma risk in premenopausal women. Routine screening for endometrial carcinoma is not performed for women on tamoxifen.

Based on the high prevalence of amenorrhea among women on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, menstrual history is not a reliable method of determining menopausal status. For laboratory testing, we order serum estradiol (E2) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. These remain reliable endocrinologic markers in the setting of tamoxifen use. Tamoxifen slightly raises FSH levels, but typically not to postmenopausal levels.
