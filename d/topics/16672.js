Untreated OSA is associated with symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired daytime function, metabolic dysfunction, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.</p><p>In most adults, first-line therapy for OSA consists of behavioral modification, including weight loss if appropriate, and positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. For patients who fail or do not tolerate PAP therapy, treatment options include oral appliances and surgical therapy. The choice among various second-line options depends on the severity of the OSA and the patient's anatomy, risk factors, and preferences.</p><p>Surgical treatment of OSA includes a wide array of procedures and approaches that enlarge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stabilize the upper airway. These procedures can be categorized as nasal, upper pharyngeal, lower pharyngeal, and global upper airway procedures. Careful patient and procedure selection, especially related to the anatomy, physiology, and function of the upper aerodigestive tract, and perioperative risk management are important considerations in the surgical evaluation of patients with OSA.</p><p>This topic will review the roles of surgery in the management of OSA, appropriate patient and procedure selection, and types of upper airway surgery used in the treatment of OSA. The diagnosis and management of OSA more generally are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-appliances-in-the-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral appliances in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126399473\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLES OF SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is usually reserved as a second-line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), either as salvage therapy in patients with OSA who cannot adhere to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or as adjunctive therapy along with CPAP or an oral appliance. Surgery is rarely indicated as primary therapy in adults; this contrasts with children, in whom adenotonsillectomy is generally considered first-line therapy for moderate-to-severe disease in the presence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Salvage role</strong> &ndash; Surgery can provide salvage treatment for patients not adequately adhering to CPAP therapy despite adequate troubleshooting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&quot;, section on 'Interventions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While there is no consensus on what constitutes CPAP failure and warrants salvage surgery, surgical consultation should be considered for patients who do not use CPAP at all, whether OSA is mild with symptoms, moderate, or severe. Surgical therapy in such cases may include multiple staged procedures or single-stage combined procedures. (See <a href=\"#H126399531\" class=\"local\">'Surgical outcomes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H776577\" class=\"local\">'Specific procedures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adjunctive role</strong> &ndash; CPAP is most effective when it is used regularly and for the majority of the sleep period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Adherence with CPAP is suboptimal in many patients, however, and this limits effectiveness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some patients struggle to use CPAP due to obstructing anatomy (eg, nasal obstruction, severe tonsillar hypertrophy) that can reduce nasal interface tolerance or mandate high therapeutic pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Likewise, nasal resistance may compromise the treatment efficacy of oral appliance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. By lowering the pressure requirement of CPAP or alleviating nasal resistance, surgical enlargement and stabilization of the airway may enable the patient to succeed with CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/10,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12-15</a>] or oral appliance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The surgical goal in these situations is to improve CPAP or oral appliance effectiveness. The specific surgical procedure depends on the site(s) of anatomic obstruction (eg, turbinate reduction to address obstructing turbinate hypertrophy). (See <a href=\"#H15956993\" class=\"local\">'Procedure selection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary role</strong> &ndash; Surgical treatment is indicated as a primary therapy for OSA when a fixed, surgically correctible airway obstruction is responsible for the apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The main example of a correctible, obstructive lesion is tonsillar hypertrophy. Tonsillectomy is used as primary therapy in patients with severe tonsillar hypertrophy or as adjunctive therapy in patients needing high CPAP pressures. (See <a href=\"#H192628251\" class=\"local\">'Tonsillectomy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126399513\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical candidacy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) depends on three main factors: patient desire for surgery, existence of a surgically correctible problem, and fitness for surgery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Desire for surgery</strong> &ndash; First, the patient must desire surgical therapy after being informed of the expected benefits and risks. Surgery is not advisable for patients who have unrealistic goals or expectations of surgery. Surgery is rarely a complete cure for OSA, and some patients may not derive any noticeable benefit. (See <a href=\"#H126399531\" class=\"local\">'Surgical outcomes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H776577\" class=\"local\">'Specific procedures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgically correctible problem</strong> &ndash; Most patients with OSA have some degree of anatomic abnormality, but not all anatomic abnormalities are conducive to surgical therapy. Occasionally, the source of obstruction is only evident during an examination while asleep or sedated. Comprehensive evaluation by an experienced surgeon, including direct visualization of the airway with or without sedation and upper airway imaging in selected cases, is critical in determining surgical candidacy. (See <a href=\"#H15956730\" class=\"local\">'Laryngoscopy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15956736\" class=\"local\">'Craniofacial and upper airway imaging'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fitness for surgery</strong> &ndash; As with all surgical procedures, patients must be deemed fit to undergo surgery and have adequate psychosocial support. Greater degrees of comorbidity increase surgical, anesthetic, and perioperative risks. Although there are no absolute criteria to judge surgical candidacy with respect to comorbidity in patients with OSA, consideration of this issue plays a major role in surgical decision-making.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">OSA itself is associated with an increased risk for complications from procedures with sedation, analgesia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anesthesia. In addition, patients with OSA often have additional comorbidities (eg, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetes, depression) that may, individually or in aggregate, impact surgical risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea#H15227501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical risk and the preoperative evaluation and management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea&quot;, section on 'Perioperative risks'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preanesthesia-medical-evaluation-of-the-obese-patient#H2063068\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preanesthesia medical evaluation of the obese patient&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with severe comorbidity may be poor candidates for upper airway reconstructive surgery, which can require multiple or complex operations. Some of these same patients may be appropriate candidates for a less complicated procedure such as tracheotomy. (See <a href=\"#H126399556\" class=\"local\">'Global upper airway procedures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126399525\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper airway surgery in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) should be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive preoperative assessment and follow-up plan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15956718\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete medical history relevant to OSA is indicated for all patients. Clinicians should review the chief complaint as stated by the patient, the symptom burden of OSA to the patient and significant others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55633 \">table 1</a>), and the severity of OSA as measured with polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H837009\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Disease spectrum'</a>). All of these factors affect how aggressively patients may wish to pursue invasive treatment.</p><p>The history should also include an assessment of the patient's past experience with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), an oral appliance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight loss. Some patients may have an unrealistic optimism for surgical treatment; others may not have had an adequate trial of CPAP and would benefit from advice to resume CPAP or other noninvasive treatments prior to considering surgery. Past experience with nonsurgical therapies can also impact the follow-up plan after surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&quot;, section on 'Interventions'</a>.)</p><p>Review of the past medical history is important, as the number and type of comorbidities impacts preoperative and perioperative management. As for other elective surgeries, preoperative consultation with a cardiologist should be considered for patients with significant cardiac risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15956724\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough upper airway examination provides the anatomical basis of surgical decision-making. A full head and neck examination is performed, with a focus on the structures that impact the upper airway.</p><p>The nasal airway is evaluated in detail. External and internal deformities and nasal valve compromise are examined with respect to nasal airflow. Nasal flow measurements, quantitative anatomical measurements (eg, acoustic rhinometry), and nasal endoscopic examination may all be indicated to supplement the nasal examination, depending upon examination findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Specific procedures are available for each type of abnormality of nasal airflow. (See <a href=\"#H126399538\" class=\"local\">'Nasal procedures'</a> below.)</p><p>A direct examination of the oral cavity and oropharynx provides insight into the potential role of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), tonsillectomy, and some tongue procedures. There are variants of UPPP to address various patterns of compromise to the oropharyngeal inlet and velopharyngeal port, depending on whether narrowing is in the superior-inferior dimension, lateral dimension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anterior-posterior dimension. (See <a href=\"#H126399544\" class=\"local\">'Upper pharyngeal procedures'</a> below.)</p><p>The lower pharyngeal and laryngeal airway is evaluated by indirect (mirror) examination and by inspection of other related structures in the neck and mouth. For example, the position of the hyoid bone relative to thyroid cartilage will determine if hyoid suspension to the thyroid cartilage is feasible. The height of the mandible will determine if genioglossus advancement is a viable option. The state and position of the teeth as well as the craniofacial examination influence surgical decision-making regarding mandible advancement or maxillomandibular advancement. (See <a href=\"#H126399550\" class=\"local\">'Lower pharyngeal and laryngeal procedures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H126399556\" class=\"local\">'Global upper airway procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15956730\"><span class=\"h2\">Laryngoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transnasal flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy is indicated if the indirect examination does not provide an adequate evaluation of the lower pharyngeal and laryngeal airway, or to examine the lower pharyngeal and laryngeal airway with the tongue in its native position if lower pharyngeal obstruction is suspected.</p><p>Fiberoptic laryngoscopy provides an excellent view of the entire upper airway, without the distortion created by anterior tongue retraction during the indirect examination. The anatomic findings dictate which type of tongue <span class=\"nowrap\">advancement/stabilization</span> procedure is indicated, whether tongue reduction or lingual tonsillectomy is indicated, and whether epiglottis correction is needed.</p><p>During this exam, various maneuvers test collapsibility of the airway (eg, end-expiration hypotonic state, Mueller maneuver), identify vulnerability to nasal obstruction (eg, effect of mouth opening), and evaluate the anatomic effects of various surgical maneuvers (eg, mandible advancement). The procedure is best performed in sitting and supine positions in order to detect the positional effects on the airway.</p><p>If further evaluation is needed, then fiberoptic laryngoscopy can be performed under drug-induced sedation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>) and monitored anesthesia care to assess for occult sites and patterns of narrowing or obstruction. Drug-induced sleep endoscopy is most useful when the awake exam is not consistent with the polysomnography result (eg, normal exam and severe OSA). It has been shown to help predict surgical treatment success for some procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], although prediction accuracy remains variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It can be useful to direct secondary site-directed procedures, and to assess the state of the airway after completion of site-directed therapies and before maxillomandibular advancement. Current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations include sleep endoscopy to determine eligibility for upper airway stimulation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Upper airway imaging in obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Nasopharyngoscopy and drug-induced sleep endoscopy'</a> and <a href=\"#H126399556\" class=\"local\">'Global upper airway procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15956736\"><span class=\"h2\">Craniofacial and upper airway imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging helps with surgical planning, especially for procedures involving osteotomies. An orthopantogram (mandible) radiograph reveals the state and position of the tooth roots, bony height of the mandible, the position of the mental nerve foramina, the presence of bony pathology, and the position of the condyles. A lateral cephalogram provides documentation of relative skeletal positions. Craniofacial and airway computed tomography (CT) scans provide details of the nasal structures, sinuses, mandible and dental dimensions, airway soft tissues, and other pathologic findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-airway-imaging-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Upper airway imaging in obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Imaging modalities'</a>.)</p><p>Awake or asleep magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational fluid dynamics are experimental and not used routinely in the surgical evaluation of patients with OSA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15956993\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Procedure selection takes into account multiple factors related to a patient's upper airway.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Native anatomy and anatomic abnormalities. The main upper airway anatomic regions and structures relevant to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F101983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101983 \">table 2</a>) and a sample of upper airway anatomic abnormalities that can be addressed surgically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F101985\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101985 \">table 3</a>) are provided in the tables.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence or absence of dynamic collapse. Examples of dynamic collapse include hypercollapsible segments (eg, nasal valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], palate, tongue, or epiglottis collapse) and variable obstruction (eg, positional turbinate hypertrophy). Many variations of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) have been designed to address different patterns of collapse. For example, expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty stabilizes lateral collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and palatal advancement pharyngoplasty addresses anterior-posterior compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preservation of physiological functions. Depending on the specific procedure, surgeons may accomplish this by preserving the uvula to prevent velopharyngeal incompetence, retaining some inferior turbinate tissue to prevent atrophic rhinitis, and partial glossectomy focused in the midline to avoid injury to the lateral neurovascular bundle of the tongue.</p><p/><p>Many surgeons take a site-directed, staged approach to surgical therapy. In this approach, primary sites of obstruction are usually addressed first with site-directed treatments. This approach uses the minimum amount of surgery to achieve the treatment goals.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharyngeal compromise by narrowed lateral pharyngeal walls, enlarged tonsils, or enlarged uvula are the most common anatomic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and collapse at the palate is the most common site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Therefore, surgery addressing these issues (ie, variants of UPPP) is the most common surgery for OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H126399544\" class=\"local\">'Upper pharyngeal procedures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third or more of patients will have lower pharyngeal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laryngeal obstruction, either alone or in addition to an upper pharyngeal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/26,27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27,29</a>]. Lower pharyngeal correction, which may require multiple surgical procedures, is therefore required in a substantial number of patients undergoing surgery for OSA. (See <a href=\"#H126399550\" class=\"local\">'Lower pharyngeal and laryngeal procedures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal obstruction should also be addressed, as it causes more negative intrapharyngeal inspiratory pressures and collapse and can force mouth opening that compromises the pharyngeal airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Of note, there is some evidence to suggest that simultaneous nasal and pharyngeal surgery should be avoided to avert postoperative swelling in both areas at the same time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H126399538\" class=\"local\">'Nasal procedures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Patients refractory to site-directed treatments may require global upper airway treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Maxillomandibular advancement provides upper and lower pharyngeal airway stability simultaneously. This major procedure provides best results when following the site-directed treatments described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>] or when there is maxillary or mandibular deficiency.

A preoperative evaluation assesses these risks to plan for optimal perioperative management. Intraoperatively, the most important factor to protect the airway is awareness. Postoperatively, appropriate disposition may vary according to the type of procedure, the type of anesthesia, the severity of OSA, the presence of comorbidities, the risk of significant airway swelling, and requirements for pain control.</p><p>Surgeons should educate patients preoperatively about these issues. Discussion points include the goal to minimize postoperative narcotics, the possible need for an intensive care unit stay, and the potential need for postoperative continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use. Patients who understand the risks and perioperative management plan will have less anxiety and an improved recovery. These and other considerations for the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management of patients with OSA are reviewed in detail separately.

Patients and referring clinicians considering surgery must have realistic expectations of treatment benefit as well as an understanding of the range and frequency of side effects and complications.</p><p>Various surgical procedures have generally not been compared directly with one another, and surgical decisions are individualized based on patient anatomy and surgeon preferences. Available evidence for specific procedures and relevant adverse effects is summarized below. (See <a href=\"#H126399538\" class=\"local\">'Nasal procedures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H126399544\" class=\"local\">'Upper pharyngeal procedures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H126399550\" class=\"local\">'Lower pharyngeal and laryngeal procedures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H126399556\" class=\"local\">'Global upper airway procedures'</a> below.)</p><p>Systematic reviews of randomized trials involving surgery versus a control condition (eg, sham procedure, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], or observation) have identified a limited number of trials and significant heterogeneity in procedures and outcomes, precluding pooling of data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Others have attempted to review the literature more broadly to include both observational studies and trials, but these reviews usually consist of small samples of these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. One challenge is that there are a variety of surgical procedures and indications, which makes it difficult to make broad generalizations based on these reviews. In addition, many studies do not mimic actual clinical practice, in that a single specific surgical procedure is studied rather than a combination of procedures modified for the specific patient. There are also inherent challenges in performing randomized trials for invasive therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Acknowledging these limitations, the best available evidence suggests that surgery has a beneficial effect on OSA when patients are appropriately selected (see <a href=\"#H126399513\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15956993\" class=\"local\">'Procedure selection'</a> above). Although the improvement in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is often only partial, other outcomes such as snoring, daytime sleepiness, and quality of life improve in most patients. While multiple observational studies have reported an association between surgery and decreased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>], this has not yet been tested in randomized trials, and more studies are needed to better characterize the potential long-term benefits of surgical therapy on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.</p><p>Further study is also needed to define patient-level characteristics that predict benefit from surgery. In general, factors that may increase the likelihood of achieving a low AHI include lower baseline AHI, lower body mass index (BMI), and less complex obstruction (eg, no circumferential velopharyngeal collapse, single-level obstruction, large tonsils, no mandibular deficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/18,27,42,48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27,42,48-52</a>]. Other predictors are procedure specific and less consistent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H776577\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC PROCEDURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126399538\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary utility of nasal procedures in the context of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is to relieve nasal obstruction as an adjunctive measure to improve outcomes with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), an oral appliance, or other surgery. Nasal procedures should not be used as a stand-alone therapy for treatment of moderate or severe OSA.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turbinate reduction &ndash; Turbinate reduction reduces obstruction caused by inferior turbinate hypertrophy, which is a common cause of nasal obstruction, especially related to recumbent position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/16,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,53,54</a>]. The goal of turbinate surgery is to reduce size without compromising mucosal function. Turbinate mucosa is important for humidifying, warming, and filtering air. Several methods are available for turbinate reduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F101986\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101986 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Septoplasty &ndash; Septoplasty improves the nasal airway by straightening a deformity of the nasal septum. Septal deformity compromises nasal breathing by physically obstructing airflow, creating airflow turbulence patterns that reduce airflow efficiency, or by promoting nasal crusting; compensatory turbinate hypertrophy on the contralateral side of a deviated septum often contributes as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Surgical correction of the septal deformity improves the nasal airway, and concurrent contralateral turbinate reduction results in further improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Sometimes surgical reduction of the compensatory turbinate hypertrophy alone is sufficient to obtain an adequate nasal airway to improve CPAP tolerance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal valve surgery &ndash; Nasal valve surgery improves airflow in patients with nasal valve compromise. The internal nasal valve, a triangular area between the nasal septum, the lateral nasal wall (specifically, the upper lateral cartilage), and the front of the inferior turbinate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F102226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102226 \">figure 1</a>), is a critically important area of the nasal airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], as it has the greatest airflow resistance of the entire upper airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Nasal valve compromise is frequently due to a septal deformity or turbinate hypertrophy, and correcting these abnormalities often fixes the compromise. In some patients, however, weak upper lateral cartilage allows persistent valve collapse. In severe cases, the alar rim (also called the external nasal valve) may also collapse. These problems are corrected in a variety of ways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F101986\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101986 \">table 4</a>). Nasal valve collapse can be less problematic with CPAP if the positive pressure stabilizes the valve, such as when a nasal pillow CPAP interface is used.

Evidence of the benefit of nasal surgery as an adjunctive procedure consists primarily of observational series.</p><p>A systematic review of the effect of isolated nasal surgery on CPAP device use and therapeutic pressures identified 18 studies in 279 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In seven studies (82 patients) that reported baseline and postoperative device pressure settings, nasal surgery reduced mean CPAP therapeutic pressure from 12 to 10 centimeters of water pressure. Clinical outcomes were variably reported; in a subgroup analysis of 11 studies that included self-reported data on CPAP use, 89 percent of 64 patients who were not using CPAP before surgery were subsequently able to accept, adhere to, or tolerate CPAP after surgery.</p><p>In a randomized pilot study, 22 patients with turbinate hypertrophy and difficulty tolerating CPAP were randomly assigned to radiofrequency turbinate reduction or sham control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compared with the control group, patients who underwent turbinate reduction had significantly improved self-reported CPAP adherence and a trend towards improved objective CPAP use (between-group difference of 32 minutes per night).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H775882\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects of nasal procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common adverse outcomes following most intranasal procedures include temporary bleeding and temporary nasal congestion. Residual nasal compromise is also a risk.</p><p>Other adverse effects vary according to the procedure. Rare adverse outcomes of septoplasty include hematoma, abscess, perforation, and saddle-nose deformity. Adverse outcomes of turbinate reduction include intranasal crusting and tissue sloughing, particularly with aggressive turbinate cautery.</p><p>Complete turbinate excision is not recommended because it can cause atrophic rhinitis or &quot;empty nose syndrome.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H126399544\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper pharyngeal procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary goal of upper pharyngeal procedures in the context of OSA is to relieve upper pharyngeal obstruction. These procedures should not be used in the absence of suspected upper pharyngeal pathology. If other obstructing areas are present (eg, lower pharyngeal obstruction), additional treatment is required (eg, lower pharyngeal procedures, oral appliance, CPAP, or positional therapy).</p><p>Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) is the most common surgical procedure for OSA, based on the fact that upper pharyngeal obstruction is the most common anatomic airway abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. UPPP is a surgical reconstructive procedure that involves reducing, tightening, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> repositioning the soft palate and related oropharyngeal structures with the goal of improving the airway while asleep. It often includes reduction, removal, or reconfiguration of the uvula.</p><p>There are many variations of this procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F101987\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101987 \">table 5</a>), each focused on correcting pharyngeal airway compromise. Some of the variants may be combined to address complicated palatal obstruction. Usually a palatine tonsillectomy is performed simultaneously if the tonsils are still present.</p><p>While excision of palatal tissue was commonly performed for UPPP in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], newer approaches include less resection and more reconstructive principles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/23,24,42,58-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,42,58-64</a>]. Selection of the optimal UPPP variant depends on individual anatomy and functional examination of the upper pharynx and palate.</p><p>There are numerous classification systems for upper pharyngeal or palatal anatomy that can help predict outcome <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> guide treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/27,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,65</a>]. The Friedman classification is commonly cited and stratifies patients by tonsil size, relationship between the oral tongue and soft palate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91839\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91839 \">figure 2</a>), and body mass index (BMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Using this classification, large tonsils, a small tongue, and BMI &le;40 predict optimal success. However, utility is limited by the fact that most patients fall into an unclear prognostic classification (ie, Friedman tongue position IIb or III), and it does not guide procedure selection. A newer system classifies more nuanced palatal and pharyngeal configurations and is intended to direct surgical approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The other common upper pharyngeal procedures are tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tonsillectomy is part of UPPP when the palate procedure is performed simultaneously. Isolated tonsillectomy is reserved for those patients with isolated palatine tonsillar hypertrophy without palatal abnormalities (see <a href=\"#H192628251\" class=\"local\">'Tonsillectomy'</a> below). Often a &quot;normal&quot; palate retrodisplaces and obstructs the velopharynx after removal of severely enlarged tonsils because the tonsils were propping the palate anteriorly prior to their removal. In this case, the tonsillectomy may need to be converted to a UPPP to reverse this problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenoidectomy can be performed with tonsillectomy or in isolation. Caution is recommended in performing it with UPPP because of the increased risk of circumferential velopharyngeal scar formation and nasopharyngeal stenosis.</p><p/><p>Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty has fallen out of favor because it does not treat OSA as well as the other surgical techniques, and it poses a risk of abnormal palatal scarring and oropharyngeal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. A variety of palatal stiffening techniques have been studied (eg, radiofrequency palatal stiffening, injection sclerotherapy, and palatal implants), but they have minimal effect on OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/42,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,69</a>].

UPPP frequently improves the physiologic abnormality of OSA but the degree of benefit is variable, and complete elimination of OSA is rare. Well-controlled studies have also shown clinical benefits on outcomes such as daytime sleepiness and quality of life.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polysomnography outcomes &ndash; The overall success rate of UPPP is approximately 50 percent, with success typically defined as &ge;50 percent reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and a postsurgery AHI &lt;20 events per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In individual prospective studies, success rates range from approximately 30 to 80 percent. The residual OSA progresses over time, at least in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], even if UPPP is combined with lower pharyngeal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A limitation of existing data, particularly in older studies, is that both patient selection and specific procedural techniques are highly variable.

Among patients with known palatal obstruction alone (for whom UPPP alone is indicated), however, 83 percent of patients had &ge;50 percent reduction in the apnea index.

Maxillomandibular advancement is generally associated with a large degree of improvement in polysomnographic parameters of OSA. However, it is a major procedure that is typically reserved for patients with persistent, significant OSA following other site-directed surgical treatments or with baseline maxillary or mandibular hypoplasia. Tracheotomy is usually reserved for patients with severe OSA who fail CPAP therapy and who have critical comorbidities. Upper airway stimulation via an implantable neurostimulator is an emerging novel treatment of the upper and lower pharyngeal airway in selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H126399556\" class=\"local\">'Global upper airway procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since surgical treatment of OSA is typically an incomplete therapy, longitudinal follow-up is important for optimal long-term outcomes. The clinical and physiologic efficacy of the surgical procedure should be assessed postoperatively by history and polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (See <a href=\"#H776525\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Epstein LJ, Kristo D, Strollo PJ Jr, et al.
