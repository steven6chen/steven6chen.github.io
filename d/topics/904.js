Anesthesiologists may be asked to provide anesthesia for procedures that require sedation or general anesthesia, or to provide monitoring with or without sedation for patients with significant comorbidities.

The goals for preanesthesia evaluation are to identify underlying medical and physical conditions that may increase risk and to create an anesthetic plan that minimizes risk. </p><p>In anticipation of gastrointestinal endoscopy, the patient should be evaluated for conditions that increase sensitivity to sedative and analgesic medications (eg, older age; obstructive sleep apnea; advanced chronic lung disease; pulmonary hypertension; coronary artery, liver, or renal disease; anxiety disorders; chronic pain; use of opioids, sedatives, or recreational drugs) to allow appropriate drug dosing and administration.

The complexity and application of advanced endoscopic procedures are increasing, as well as the comorbidities of the patients who undergo these procedures. In particular, therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is associated with increased risk of adverse events, regardless of ASA status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and is now performed for patients who were previously considered inoperable or who are critically ill.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preanesthesia testing</strong> &mdash; Preoperative laboratory and cardiac testing should be performed as it would be for patients who undergo anesthesia for surgery.

Endoscopic procedures are classified as conferring low risk of perioperative cardiac events, according to the usual cardiac risk stratification tool for noncardiac surgery, the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI). However, the RCRI may underestimate risk for patients who undergo advanced endoscopic procedures, particularly ERCP. ERCP carries an approximately 5 percent risk of major complications, including acute pancreatitis, bleeding, sepsis, and perforation, any of which can result in major cardiovascular events.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia#H1078268999\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3216914628\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many ways to provide anesthesia for endoscopy, and practice varies widely. These procedures may be performed in free standing endoscopy units, radiology suites, in-hospital endoscopy units, or operating room suites. Basic and emergency equipment, medications, and personnel should be the same, regardless of anesthetizing location. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-anesthesia#H703642258\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Requirements for office anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H838654460\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of anesthetic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of anesthetic technique should be based on patient factors and the requirements of the procedure, including expected duration and complexity. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation may be the best choice for patients at high risk of aspiration, and for many advanced endoscopic procedures. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) must be used in facilities without anesthesia machines or gas scavenging, and therefore without the option for inhalation anesthesia. Induction and maintenance of general anesthesia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Moderate or deep sedation is commonly used for patients without risk factors for aspiration. Deep sedation can easily become general anesthesia, especially if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Moderate sedation (also called conscious sedation) refers to a level of sedation in which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands and maintain spontaneous ventilation without support. Patients under deep sedation cannot be easily aroused, but respond purposefully to painful stimulation, and may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109909\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109909 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults#H2743659574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitored anesthesia care in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment of sedation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults#H3175587877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitored anesthesia care in adults&quot;, section on 'Propofol'</a>.)</p><p>Unsedated endoscopy is rarely used in the United States, and is more commonly used in other countries. Though most patients prefer sedation or anesthesia, for select patients (eg, some patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease) and procedures, sedation-free endoscopy may be preferred and is usually well tolerated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedation-free-gastrointestinal-endoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedation-free gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H468482741\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring for anesthesia for endoscopy should include standard physiologic monitors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110080 \">table 4</a>), with additional monitoring based on patient comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults#H1624107929\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitored anesthesia care in adults&quot;, section on 'Standard physiologic monitors'</a>.)</p><p>Ventilation should be monitored with capnography during moderate or deep sedation. Capnography facilitates early detection of apnea and airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], predicts the development of hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and may reduce patient injury related to respiratory depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Measurement of exhaled carbon dioxide may be challenging during upper endoscopic procedures, but is usually possible using a two channel nasal oxygen cannula, or the end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> tubing under or connected to an oxygen mask. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459772238\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory events, including hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and respiratory arrest, are among the most common complications of anesthesia for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H1882435719\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.) </p><p>Airway emergencies such as laryngospasm and intractable airway obstruction may occur with little warning during both routine and advanced upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic procedures. Preparation for airway management should be the same for these procedures as it is for other anesthetics, with routine and emergency airway equipment available. An air-mask-bag unit (AMBU) should be immediately available. Alternatively, the author routinely uses a Mapleson C breathing circuit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction#H254392428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;, section on 'Preparation for anesthetic induction'</a>.) </p><p>Airway management for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy should be based on patient and procedure related factors, including the expected duration and complexity of the procedure. The majority of colonoscopies and upper endoscopies are performed with spontaneous ventilation, with or without airway devices, with sedation or general anesthesia. By definition, patients who are unresponsive to a painful stimulus are under general anesthesia, regardless of the airway management technique. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitored-anesthesia-care-in-adults#H1459608333\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitored anesthesia care in adults&quot;, section on 'Monitoring depth of sedation and analgesia'</a>.)</p><p>When to perform endotracheal intubation for endoscopy is controversial, and practice varies. As an example, some clinicians intubate all or most patients who undergo complex endoscopic procedures (eg, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]), while others intubate only selectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The following issues should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Predicted difficulty with airway management &mdash; </strong>The choice of anesthetic technique <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> airway management may depend on the preoperative airway assessment, if it predicts difficulty with mask ventilation, supraglottic airway ventilation, or endotracheal intubation, or airway obstruction under sedation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk of aspiration &mdash; </strong>Each patient who undergoes GI endoscopy should be evaluated for risk factors for aspiration, and the plan for sedation and risk of aspiration should be documented. In addition to patient factors that increase the risk of aspiration with sedation or anesthesia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F98506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98506 \">table 5</a>), some of the conditions for which endoscopy is performed are associated with a high risk of aspiration (eg, gastric outlet obstruction, achalasia, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, esophageal stricture, bowel obstruction). These patients should receive general anesthesia with rapid sequence induction and intubation, or awake endotracheal intubation, to protect the airway and minimize the chance of aspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with pharyngeal pouches, intubation in Trendelenberg position would allow drainage of pouch contents by gravity, and may reduce the risk of aspiration before intubation. Alternatively, awake intubation may rarely be considered after discussion with the gastroenterologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> otolaryngologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia#H1039404872\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible scope intubation for anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Awake intubation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During colonoscopy, gas insufflation into the colon, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> manual abdominal pressure during the procedure, may increase the risk of aspiration during sedation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Shared airway</strong> &mdash; The anesthesiologist and the gastroenterologist share the airway during upper endoscopic procedures, and airway management must be coordinated among the care providers. As an example, laryngospasm can occur when an endoscope is inserted or secretions collect during inadequate sedation or anesthesia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positioning for the procedure &mdash; </strong>Some endoscopic procedures are routinely performed in the prone or semiprone position (eg, ERCP), which may limit access to the airway and options for a change in airway management during anesthesia. </p><p/><p>A variety of airway devices may be used for endoscopic procedures, including endotracheal tubes, supraglottic airways, and airway conduits (eg, nasal trumpets). Patients who undergo ERCP in the prone position commonly receive general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. An alternate approach used by the author is placement of a nasal trumpet, connected to a Mapleson C breathing circuit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112185\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112185 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112186\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112186 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The Mapleson C circuit is a widely available, compact breathing circuit that allows ventilation with a breathing bag without the need for an anesthesia machine. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3547774180\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthetic requirements for endoscopic procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal endoscopy requires a cooperative or still patient, and a level of <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/analgesia</span> that provides anxiolysis, pain control, and amnesia. During the procedure, varying levels of <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/analgesia</span> may be required.</p><p>Broadly, the GI endoscopic procedures fall into three categories, each with unique requirements for sedation or anesthesia: screening colonoscopy, diagnostic endoscopy, and the advanced endoscopic procedures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4178893170\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper GI endoscopy is performed in a head up position, with the patient turned slightly towards the gastroenterologist. The most stimulating portion of a diagnostic upper endoscopy is the passage of the endoscope into the esophagus. Anesthesia for endoscope insertion must be deep enough to prevent coughing, gagging, retching, vomiting, and laryngospasm. We coordinate the timing with the gastroenterologist, and in most cases, the endoscope is inserted after a bolus of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3876553790\"><span class=\"h3\">Colonoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonoscopy is performed with the patient in the lateral position, though a change to supine is sometimes necessary. Sedation and anesthesia are usually less challenging for colonoscopy than for upper endoscopy, because the anesthesia clinician has access to the airway, and the airway is not shared with the endoscopist. Insertion of the colonoscope is usually well tolerated, and the stimulating portions of the procedure relate to gas insufflation into the colon, and manipulation of the colonoscope around curves. Gas insufflation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal compression may increase the risk of aspiration, and aspiration is a constant risk during these procedures. The author prefers to maintain sedation light enough that airway reflexes are preserved for colonoscopy, while others administer deeper sedation. (See <a href=\"#H459772238\" class=\"local\">'Airway management'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3868846596\"><span class=\"h3\">Advanced endoscopic procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound, esophageal stricture dilatation and stenting, treatment of esophageal varices, and various other specialized procedures. Minimally invasive endoscopic procedures continue to be developed, such as peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Anesthetic concerns for advanced endoscopic procedures include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ERCP is the most common advanced endoscopic procedure. ERCP is associated with an increased risk of adverse events compared with other GI endoscopies, and is often performed on patients with metabolic derangements or critical illness. ERCP is performed in the prone or semiprone position. (See <a href=\"#H1693956564\" class=\"local\">'Preprocedure evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H459772238\" class=\"local\">'Airway management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced endoscopic procedures often require repeated insertion and removal of the endoscope and instruments; an adequate depth of anesthesia must be maintained at all times. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endotracheal intubation should be performed for airway control and protection for patients who undergo treatment of gastroesophageal fistulae with clips or glue, especially for those with a history of aspiration. These procedures are long and often complicated, and may involve frequent endoscope changes. In addition, many patients with gastroesophageal fistulae have some degree of respiratory compromise due to ongoing aspiration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal dilatation with a bougie or balloon is very stimulating and requires deepened sedation or anesthesia. Esophageal dilatation is most often performed for strictures that result from gastroesophageal reflux, though a variety of other etiologies is possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of benign esophageal strictures&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who have had esophagectomy (for cancer or achalasia) frequently present for esophageal dilation. In the absence of gastric motility concerns, we manage anesthesia for these patients with supplemental nasal oxygen or a nasal trumpet connected to a Mapleson C breathing system. Others may choose to perform endotracheal intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopic drainage of large pancreatic pseudocysts should be performed with general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. The risk of aspiration, and the plan for airway management, should be discussed preoperatively with the gastroenterologist. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is the endoscopic equivalent of surgical myotomy and is a newer technique for the management of achalasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. POEM is also used for other spastic foregut disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with achalasia are at high risk of aspiration, and these procedures should be performed with general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Preprocedure esophageal drainage should be considered, as well as intubation in a semi-reclining position, with rapid sequence induction and intubation. Awake intubation may be considered for select patients.

The procedure is not particularly stimulating, and postoperative opioids are not usually required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A small pneumoperitoneum occurs in up to 50 percent of POEM procedures. Airway pressures and tidal volumes should be monitored closely, as severe or tension pneumoperitoneum may rarely occur. Gastric distention should be ruled out prior to abdominal decompression with a Veress needle or Angiocath.
