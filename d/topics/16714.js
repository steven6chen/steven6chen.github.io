After fainting, a person quickly &quot;comes to&quot; and is OK again. Syncope is very common. About 1 out of every 3 people has it at some point in life. In many cases, syncope is nothing to worry about.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630594279\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes syncope?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Syncope happens when the brain temporarily doesn't get enough blood. One of the most common reasons this happens is called &quot;vasovagal syncope.&quot; If you have vasovagal syncope, your body has a reaction in which your heart beats too slowly or your blood vessels expand (or both). This can happen for lots of different kinds of reasons. People can have vasovagal syncope if they:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have stress from fear or pain (for example, because they are injured or have blood taken for tests)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stand for too long or are over-tired or overheated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an unusual reaction to urinating, coughing, or other body functions</p><p/><p>Sometimes vasovagal syncope happens with no clear cause.</p><p>People can also have syncope that is not vasovagal. This can happen due to the following problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heart beats too quickly or too slowly because of problems with the heart's electrical system or because of side effects from some medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Something blocks the flow of blood in the heart. This can happen in people who have conditions called &quot;aortic stenosis&quot; (a valve disease) or &quot;hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&quot; (a heart muscle disease).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your blood pressure drops when you stand or sit up. That can happen if you:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not drink enough water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Take certain medicines that cause your blood pressure to drop</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drink alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lose a lot of blood (for example, if you get hurt)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Have a medical condition that affects your blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630594293\"><span class=\"h1\">Is syncope dangerous?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases it is not dangerous. But it can be dangerous if you fall and hurt yourself when you faint. It can also be dangerous if you faint while driving. To be safe, check with your doctor or nurse before you start driving again after you faint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630594300\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Anyone who faints should see a doctor or nurse. Most cases of syncope are not serious. But people can get hurt when they faint. Plus, in some cases syncope is caused by a serious medical condition that should be treated. Knowing what caused you to faint can help you prevent it from happening again.</p><p>Tell your doctor or nurse what happened before, during, and after you fainted. If someone was with you when you fainted, that person might be able to tell you what happened. The following information is helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What were you doing before you passed out?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How were you feeling before you passed out?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long were you passed out?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well did you recover?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any past history of fainting?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A list of the medicines you take</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any medical conditions you might have</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse will ask you a few questions and do an exam. During the exam, the doctor or nurse might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your blood pressure and heart rate when you are lying down, sitting, or standing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Listen to your heart to check whether something might be wrong with your heart valves or heart muscle</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630594307\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will do a test called an electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;). For this test, the doctor will put sticky pads on your chest, belly, arms, and legs. Long, thin wires connect the pads to a machine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>). The device records the electrical activity in your heart. This can show if the pattern of your heartbeats is abnormal.</p><p>You might get other tests, too. These could include 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create an image of the heart. It allows the doctors to measure the walls and chambers of the heart, see how the heart is pumping and check how the heart valves are working. Heart valves are flaps of tissue that open and close like swinging doors. They help keep blood moving in one direction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotid sinus massage &ndash; For this test, a doctor presses on a blood vessel in your neck while watching your electrocardiogram. This can show if your blood vessel is too sensitive to pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home heart monitor &ndash; For home monitoring, you might wear or carry a device around at home. You will keep doing normal activities. One type of monitor records all your heart beats for 1 or 2 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76605 \">figure 2</a>). With others, you push a button to record heart beats when you feel symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75670 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tilt table test &ndash; For this test, you lie flat on a table. Your doctor then monitors your heartbeats and blood pressure while your body is tilted with your head up (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57312\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57312 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630594314\"><span class=\"h1\">Can syncope be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might be able to reduce your chances of fainting again if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn what causes your syncope:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If an activity or condition causes your syncope, you can try to avoid it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a medicine causes your syncope, your doctor can help you find an alternative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If a heart condition is causing your syncope, your doctor can suggest a treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lay down with your feet up when you feel like you might faint.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630594321\"><span class=\"h1\">How is syncope treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing your syncope. In many cases, the main treatment is to avoid the situations that cause syncope.</p><p>In less common cases, other treatment might be needed. For example, you might need a pacemaker if your heart beats too slowly and this causes syncope. A pacemaker is a device that is put under your skin. Thin wires attach them to your heart. They help the heart beat at a normal speed or in a regular pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630594328\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child faints?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child faints, you should take him or her to see a doctor. Most cases of syncope in children are not serious. Often they are caused by vasovagal syncope. Syncope can also happen in children if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They hold their breath for too long</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Their blood pressure drops when they stand or sit up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They swallow medicines, drugs, or alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have carbon monoxide poisoning</p><p/><p>In less common cases, syncope in children can be caused by a life-threatening condition, such as a serious heart condition, overheating, or a severe allergic reaction (called anaphylaxis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630594335\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradycardia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bradycardia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagal-maneuvers-and-their-responses-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vagal maneuvers and their responses (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
