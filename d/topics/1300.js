The specific target for maternal health was to reduce each country&rsquo;s 1990 maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by three quarters by 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This goal was expanded by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to reduce the global MMR to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This will require the involvement of health systems, communities, and families globally, and necessitate addressing political, economic, social, technical, and environmental factors contributing to maternal morbidity and mortality. </p><p>For pregnant women, optimizing intrapartum care appears to be the single most important intervention for reducing maternal mortality in both high-income countries <span class=\"nowrap\">(HIC)/resource-rich</span> settings and <span class=\"nowrap\">middle/low-income</span> countries <span class=\"nowrap\">(MIC/LIC)/resource-limited</span> settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The leading causes of mortality in these women are hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, infection, obstructed labor, and complications from unsafe abortions. In LICs, major causal factors are inadequate prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care by skilled birth attendants and inadequate facilities, equipment, and services. For nonpregnant women, family planning is the single most important intervention for reducing maternal mortality. </p><p>This topic will discuss approaches to reduction of maternal mortality in the poorest parts of the world. In these areas, dying as a result of pregnancy or childbirth is about 1 in 6 compared with about 1 in 30,000 in Northern Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The model estimated that 342,203 women died of maternal causes in 2008, but that contraceptive use averted an additional 272,040 deaths (95% CI 127,937-407,134), thus use of contraception resulted in a 44 percent reduction in maternal death. The model also predicted that satisfying unmet needs for contraception could prevent another 104,000 maternal deaths per year (29 percent reduction). Another model also affirmed that promotion and facilitation of family planning should be the initial approach for reduction of maternal mortality in low-income countries (LICs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Unsafe abortion is another major cause of maternal death that ideally is averted by protection against unwanted pregnancy. In 2005, it was estimated that 70,000 women died yearly as a result of unsafe abortion, accounting for one in eight (13 percent) maternal deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Almost all of these deaths occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and some Eastern European countries; a negligible number occurred in Southern and Western Europe, North America and China. When unwanted pregnancy does occur, maternal death is rare where abortion is legal and access is nonrestrictive, and when pregnancy terminations are carried out by skilled health professionals using effective methods in hygienic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Maternal mortality'</a>.)</p><p>Short interpregnancy intervals also appear to increase the risk of maternal mortality, and can be avoided by use of contraception. A Latin American study including 456,889 women reported interpregnancy intervals of less than six months were associated with an increased risk of maternal death compared with women with interpregnancy intervals of 18 to 23 months (adjusted OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.2-5.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Four smaller studies of variable quality also found an association between short interpregnancy interval and maternal death, but the trend was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The availability of a skilled attendant implies the presence of a health professional with midwifery skills, as well as resources to enable them to perform capably, including access to higher levels of obstetric care in case of complications requiring surgery or blood transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Ensuring that all women give birth with a skilled attendant is considered one of the key strategies for reducing maternal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/4,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16</a>].

In a study from Nigeria, which has a very high MMR <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;1000/100,000</span> live births in 2008), the reasons for low utilization of antenatal and delivery care among women with recent pregnancies were: custom, lack of perceived need, distance, lack of transport, lack of permission, cost, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unwillingness to see a male doctor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Therefore, when designing and implementing interventions to improve obstetrical care, women need to be educated about safe pregnancy and delivery, their economic and geographic accessibility issues need to be addressed, and their social and cultural beliefs and practices need to be respected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89738349\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency obstetrical care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the ability to provide the following seven &ldquo;basic&rdquo; services requisite for provision of emergency obstetric care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer parenteral antibiotics </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer uterotonic drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> to women with <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manually remove the placenta</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove retained products manually, with vacuum extraction, or by dilation and curettage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform assisted vaginal delivery by vacuum extraction or forceps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform basic neonatal resuscitation with a bag and mask</p><p/><p>&ldquo;Comprehensive&rdquo; services can provide the ability to perform surgery (eg, cesarean delivery) and blood transfusions, in addition to basic services.</p><p>Access to surgical care can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in women who require hysterectomy because of hemorrhage or who experience obstructed labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Cesarean delivery rates are an indirect measure of access to skilled providers and surgical facilities, equipment, and services. The WHO, the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF), and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) cite a minimal cesarean delivery rate of 5 percent as evidence of adequate access to these resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Both structural and organizational barriers (eg, cost, lack of vehicles for transport, lack of telephones, difficult geographical terrain) can prolong the time it takes a woman to reach an appropriate health care facility after a problem has been recognized and the decision has been made to refer her for emergency obstetrical care.

Although intuitive, there is no high quality evidence to support this hypothesis or determine the optimal types of interventions. A systematic review of 19 studies of 14 interventions (eg, ambulances, maternity waiting homes) designed to overcome delays in receiving emergency obstetrical care in LICs found that the interventions studied significantly reduced neonatal mortality and appeared to decrease stillbirths, but did not clearly demonstrate a sustained reduction in maternal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, these results are difficult to interpret given the limitations of the studies, such as differences in the interventions and use of multiple interventions, differences in timing of the interventions, and lack of analysis of the effects of concurrent factors that affect maternal mortality.
