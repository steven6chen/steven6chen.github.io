Blunt scrotal trauma occurs most commonly among 6 to 12 year old boys with typical mechanisms, including falls or kicks during sports and injuries from bicycle or motor vehicle collisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In toddlers and young children (less than six years of age), injuries from falls or toilet seats predominate. In adolescent males, injuries related to sports and falls also occur, but multiple trauma with associated scrotal injury from motor vehicle accidents and assaults is also an important etiology. Blunt scrotal trauma is typically unilateral and involves compression of the scrotal contents against the pubic bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Penetrating scrotal injuries are uncommon in children but can occur from bicycle handlebars, falls with impalement, and animal bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In adolescents and young adults, gunshot wounds account for most penetrating injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Stab wounds, including self-emasculation injuries and human or animal bites, have also been described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16472894\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16472902\"><span class=\"h2\">Scrotal anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy of the scrotum should be considered in a layered fashion. The scrotum is a sac that contains the testicles and portions of the spermatic cords. It provides two discrete cavities for the testicles. These cavities connect at the median raphe, a scrotal projection that extends from the dorsum of the penis to the anus. The layers of the scrotum include the skin and the dartos, a muscular layer that provides the septum for the two scrotal cavities and forms the outermost fascial layer of the scrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58712\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58712 \">figure 1</a>). &#160;</p><p>The testicle and its appendages, epididymis, spermatic cord and associated nerve, artery and venous vessels are contained within the tunica vaginalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75672\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75672 \">figure 2</a>). The testicle itself has an additional covering called the tunica albuginea that maintains its oval contour. Additional testicular coverings include the infundibuliform fascia, cremaster muscle, and intercrural fascia. </p><p>Because the left spermatic cord is longer than the right, the left scrotum and testicle typically hang lower than the right. The higher relative position of the right testicle puts it at greater risk of blunt injury with compression against the pubic bone. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2573456\"><span class=\"h3\">Injury patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Types of scrotal injury may include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scrotal skin lacerations and contusions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scrotal hematomas external to the testicle, including lacerations of the tunica vaginalis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traumatic epididymitis </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematocele, ie, blood outside the tunica albuginea, but contained within the tunica vaginalis indicating disruption of the tunica albuginea and potential testicular rupture</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular hematoma </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular fracture</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular avulsion </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicular dislocation into the inguinal canal or abdominal wall with unilateral or bilateral empty scrotum</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traumatic testicular torsion </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16472909\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjacent structures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proximity of the scrotum to the lower abdomen, pelvis, penis, rectum, and upper thighs with associated femoral vessels, warrants recognition of injuries to these adjacent structures. In gunshot related injuries, injuries other than genitourinary, particularly lower extremity injuries, are commonly associated with scrotal wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>In children with blunt abdominal trauma, scrotal trauma may accompany pelvic fractures, urethral injuries, and bladder injuries. Careful evaluation of the scrotum should assure that the testes are in the scrotum as testicular dislocation after abdominal trauma may be initially missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Due to the potential for the processus vaginalis to remain patent, there may be communication with the abdominal cavity. In children with scrotal swelling and significant abdominal trauma, hernias with blood tracking down from more remote intraabdominal injuries are another anatomical consideration. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16472916\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16472924\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penetrating scrotal trauma and multiple trauma with blunt scrotal injury usually present soon after injury. Patients with isolated blunt scrotal trauma may delay medical evaluation. The mechanism of injury and its temporal relation to the onset of any scrotal swelling or pain, prior history of scrotal pain or swelling, and any associated symptoms should be obtained. Pain, swelling, bruising, and skin defects are common complaints. Nausea or vomiting may also be present. Significant pain with marked swelling localized to the testicle or scrotum suggests testicular injury and warrants prompt evaluation and surgical consultation. Serious blunt scrotal trauma typically arises from high force mechanisms (eg, motor vehicle collision) while the majority of children have trivial injury from minor falls or kicks during sports. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16472931\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the patient with a history of scrotal trauma or blunt abdominal trauma, the physical examination should begin with a primary survey and treatment of life-threatening injuries, especially in patients with multiple or penetrating trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 3</a>). Scrotal injury should be identified and treated as part of the secondary survey. Moderate to severe pain or scrotal swelling are findings that suggest significant scrotal injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Initial approach'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Primary survey'</a>.)</p><p>Analgesia for moderate to severe pain (eg, intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> intravenously and, in some instances, procedural sedation) may be necessary to obtain an accurate physical examination. If sedation is contemplated, the clinician may want to contact an appropriate surgeon, if available, to assist with the physical assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A focused scrotal examination includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspection of the skin integrity and extent of any defects, lacerations, or ecchymosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of entrance and exit wounds in boys with penetrating trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of any swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the testicle and intrascrotal structures, including location of testicle and lie, location of swelling, tenderness on palpation, testicular integrity, and cremasteric reflex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal examination and stool testing for occult blood to evaluate for associated abdominal and perineal injury or a high riding prostate in an adolescent patient </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation of femoral vessels, particularly in patients with penetrating trauma</p><p/><p>If the testicle is not palpable in the hemiscrotum, transillumination may be helpful, as is palpation for inguinal hernias or masses.</p><p>Significant testicular tenderness with swelling raises the possibility of testicular rupture, although most patients with this finding will have an intact testicle upon ultrasound. Focal testicular swelling may indicate a hematocele, a collection of blood outside the tunica albuginea, but contained by the tunica vaginalis and is also associated with testicular rupture. Thus, these findings are indications for testicular ultrasound. The relatively small prepubertal testicle in the setting of any significant swelling or pain may make palpation of the testicle and reliable localization of any fluid collection clinically difficult. Overlying hematomas may obscure reliable evaluation of the underlying testicle. Swelling without pain also warrants sonographic imaging and surgical consultation as testicular rupture can still be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2573654\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Severe scrotal pain and swelling in the setting of minor trauma should raise suspicion for testicular torsion. In contrast, painless scrotal swelling or hematoma after multiple trauma may indicate intraabdominal trauma and extravasation of blood into the scrotum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Testicular torsion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>A lack of a cremasteric reflex (testicular retraction when the ipsilateral thigh is gently stroked) is most often secondary to anxiety when bilateral, but particularly when unilateral, can be a sign of significant testicular injury or traumatic torsion.</p><p>When evaluating patients with significant scrotal injury marked by moderate to severe pain or swelling, clinicians should pay particular attention to the penis, abdomen, and pelvis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the penis and corporal integrity is important as the corpus cavernosum and bulbous urethral lie deep to the median raphe and septum of the scrotum. Blood at the meatus indicates urethral injury. Ecchymosis of the penis, perineum, or scrotum can occur with anterior and posterior urethral injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-genitourinary-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt genitourinary trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries to the foreskin or lacerations to the penis in association with blunt or penetrating scrotal injury can indicate physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other concerning findings for inflicted injury include scrotal or penile burns, patterned skin bruises, fractures, mouth injuries, and anal trauma.

Decreased blood flow is an indication for emergent surgical exploration and repair. Imaging should not be delayed even though repair of testicular rupture within 72 hours has preserved function in some cases. Ultrasound is an especially useful adjunct to the difficult or inconclusive physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The accuracy of ultrasonography in children is operator-dependent and should be performed by a radiologist or technician with pediatric expertise.
