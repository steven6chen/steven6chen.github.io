These episodes may be precipitated by heavy exercise, fasting, or high-carbohydrate meals. PP is classified as hypokalemic when episodes occur in association with low potassium blood levels or as hyperkalemic when episodes can be induced by elevated potassium. Most cases of PP are hereditary, usually with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Acquired cases of hypokalemic PP have been described in association with hyperthyroidism. The clinical features of these disorders are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65215 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In contrast to other forms of thyroid disease, which are more common in women, thyrotoxic PP is much more frequently seen in males; the prevalence of thyrotoxic PP is also highest in Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This diagnosis should be considered when this demographic of patients presents with marked painless weakness after provocation with exercise or changes in diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Thyrotoxic PP will be reviewed here. Other causes of PP and other neurologic manifestations of thyrotoxicosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemic periodic paralysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic manifestations of hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyrotoxic PP is a sporadic form of hypokalemic PP that may occur in association with hyperthyroidism. This contrasts with familial hypokalemic PP which has an autosomal dominant inheritance.</p><p>Any etiology of hyperthyroidism, including thyroxine abuse, can be associated with thyrotoxic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Graves' disease is the underlying disorder in most cases of thyrotoxic PP, as it is in most cases of hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thyrotoxic PP has been most widely reported and studied in Asian populations, in which the incidence among patients with hyperthyroidism is approximately 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. This contrasts with non-Asian populations, in which the incidence of thyrotoxic PP among individuals with hyperthyroidism is estimated to be 0.1 to 0.2 percent. A New Zealand study found that Polynesians were also at higher risk for thyrotoxic PP compared to those of European descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Despite a higher incidence of hyperthyroidism in women, over 95 percent of thyrotoxic PP cases occur in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Thus, the incidence of thyrotoxic PP is particularly high among Asian men with thyrotoxicosis (8.7 to 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which hyperthyroidism can produce hypokalemic PP is not well understood. Thyroid hormone increases tissue responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation, which, along with thyroid hormone, increases sodium-potassium ATPase activity on the skeletal muscle membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This tends to drive potassium into cells, perhaps leading to hyperpolarization of the muscle membrane and relative inexcitability of the muscle fibers. Thyrotoxic patients with PP have been found to have higher sodium pump activity than those without paralytic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18</a>]. In this way, excess thyroid hormone may predispose to paralytic episodes by increasing the susceptibility to the hypokalemic action of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> or insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>].</p><p>Insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia is suspected to have a role in the pathogenesis of thyrotoxic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In one study, patients with a history of thyrotoxic PP were heavier and exhibited reduced insulin sensitivity compared with patients with thyrotoxicosis without thyrotoxic PP. Insulin also activates the sodium-potassium ATPase pump and may act synergistically with thyroid hormone to drive potassium into cells. This is consistent with the observation that a heavy meal can be a precipitant for attacks of thyrotoxic PP.</p><p>While patients with thyrotoxic PP do not have the genetic mutations associated with familial hypokalemic PP, it has been suggested that individuals who are susceptible to thyrotoxic PP may have an ion channel defect, which, in the euthyroid state, is not sufficient to produce symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/8,22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22-27</a>]. One study revealed that 10 of 30 Caucasian or Brazilian patients with thyrotoxic PP had a mutation in the gene encoding Kir2.6, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, expressed in skeletal muscle that is transcriptionally regulated by thyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These mutations were also seen in 26 percent of 26 thyrotoxic PP patients from Singapore, but only in 1 of 114 patients from Hong Kong or Thailand.</p><p>Other predisposing genetic traits have been suggested. One study comparing DNA analysis in 50 patients with thyrotoxic PP to 50 patients with hyperthyroidism but no PP suggested an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in intron 3 of the gene encoding the alpha3 subunit of the GABA receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>A role for testosterone in the pathogenesis for thyrotoxic PP is suggested by the predominance of this condition in men, and the demonstration that testosterone increases sodium-potassium ATPase activity in animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with all the periodic paralyses, attacks of weakness occur suddenly with generalized weakness and preserved consciousness. The age of onset of symptoms in thyrotoxic PP is between 20 and 39 years in approximately 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10,14,15,17,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15,17,33-35</a>]. Although this later age of onset is helpful to distinguish thyrotoxic PP from the familial periodic paralyses, which present at a younger age, adolescents with thyrotoxic PP have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/23,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,36</a>].</p><p>In many patients, clinical features of hyperthyroidism precede the onset of PP by months or even years, but they have been noted to occur at the same time (in 43 to 60 percent of patients) or following the development of PP (in 11 to 17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10,13,16,17,34,35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,16,17,34,35,37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neurologic examination during an attack demonstrates weakness, usually affecting proximal more than distal muscles, and the legs more than the arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/4,14,33,34,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,33,34,38</a>]. Mild myalgia is a complaint in less than half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Decreased muscle tone with hyporeflexia or areflexia is typical, although normal or hyperactive reflexes may be observed. In one series, tachycardia (mean heart rate = 105 bpm) was noted at presentation and distinguished these patients from those with familial hypokalemic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Exceptional cases of bulbar weakness and respiratory weakness requiring ventilatory support have been reported in thyrotoxic PP, as well as cases of severe, even fatal, arrhythmias (sinus arrest, second degree atrioventricular [AV] block, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/7,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,39-42</a>].</p><p>Attacks vary in frequency and duration. Intervals of weeks to months are common, but some patients experience several attacks per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/14,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,38</a>]. A duration of symptoms of several hours is typical, but can range from minutes to days. As with hypokalemic PP, attacks in thyrotoxic PP can be precipitated by events that are associated with an increased release of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> or insulin, both of which cause movement of potassium into cells and low potassium blood levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22</a>]. Most commonly, the inciting event is either rest after strenuous physical activity, stress, or a high-carbohydrate load. Other events reported to induce attacks in thyrotoxic PP include cold exposure, infection, alcohol intake, pulse corticosteroid therapy, beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilator use, and menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10,35,43-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,35,43-47</a>]. In many instances, no obvious precipitant is identified. Although attacks of weakness may occur at any time of the day, a high frequency of attacks at night or early in the morning has been reported in thyrotoxic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A seasonal variation has also been suggested, with more frequent attacks in summer months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of hypokalemia during an attack is variable; in one series of 78 patients the mean serum potassium level was 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Cases with extremely low potassium levels &lt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> are frequently reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/4,7,14,34,39-41,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,14,34,39-41,48</a>]. However, in at least two cases of periodic paralysis attributed to thyrotoxic PP, the ictal potassium level was normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/14,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,49,50</a>]. Usually, the severity of weakness corresponds to the degree of hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Patients with thyrotoxic PP, by definition, have attacks in the hyperthyroid state. Supporting laboratory findings include elevation of serum thyroxine (T4) and low thyrotropin levels (TSH). Patients with elevated T3 and normal T4 levels have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Other common laboratory findings include mild hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/7,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,34,35</a>]. These findings may help distinguish thyrotoxic PP from familial hypokalemic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/37,38,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38,52</a>]. In one study, a urine calcium to phosphate ratio of higher than 1.7 was a sensitive and specific test to distinguishing thyrotoxic PP from familial hypokalemic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Creatine kinase may be normal but has been reported to be mildly elevated in two-thirds of patients, and rhabdomyolysis has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/7,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,54</a>].</p><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes are common in an attack of thyrotoxic PP. These include those findings consistent with hypokalemia: ST depression, sinus tachycardia, U waves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73888\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73888 \">waveform 1</a>), as well as an elevated higher heart rate, abnormal PR interval, higher QRS voltage, and first degree AV block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/48,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,55</a>]. The latter ECG findings are more common in patients with thyrotoxic PP as compared to patients with familial hypokalemic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Severe arrhythmias (eg, sinus arrest, second degree atrioventricular [AV] block, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia) are not common but are described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an acute attack, thyrotoxic PP must be distinguished from other causes of acute quadriparesis, such as myasthenic crisis, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, acute myelopathy (eg, transverse myelitis), tick paralysis, and botulism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. The finding of hypokalemia generally alerts the clinician to the diagnosis of periodic paralysis, in which the possibility of thyrotoxicosis must always be evaluated, particularly in the absence of a family history. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.) After a thyrotoxic state is established, the patient is further evaluated to determine the underlying cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The results of electromyography, provocative testing, and muscle biopsy are similar to those seen in familial hypokalemic PP, but these tests are often unnecessary (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemic periodic paralysis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>).</p><p>If thyrotoxicosis is not established as the cause, an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed to identify a prolonged QT or QU interval suggestive of Andersen syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77018\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77018 \">waveform 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemic periodic paralysis&quot;, section on 'Andersen syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with familial hypokalemic PP, potassium supplementation may lead to improvement of weakness. One prospective study compared treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> to normal saline infusion and found a shorter recovery time with use of potassium (6.3 versus 13.5 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In a retrospective case series, patients who received intravenous potassium recovered more quickly than those who received oral supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. There may be a delayed response of a few hours following potassium administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Required doses of potassium supplementation are variable and range from 10 to 200 mEq [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/4,7,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,33</a>].</p><p>Rebound hyperkalemia appears to be a prominent problem in thyrotoxic PP, occurring in approximately 40 to 59 percent of treated attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/7,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33,34</a>]. In one study, eighty percent of patients who developed rebound hyperkalemia had received greater than 90 meq of potassium within 24 hours. This has led to a suggested protocol of 30 mEq of oral potassium every two hours until improvement begins, with a maximum dose of 90 mEq in 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Some recommend even slower rates of administration (&lt;10 mEq per hour) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/4,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,57</a>]. In one case series, a fall in serum potassium occurred during initial treatment in one-fourth of patients; these patients also had higher free thyroxine levels, ultimately required higher doses of potassium supplementation, and were more likely to have severe rebound hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Close monitoring of serum potassium is essential, and cardiac monitoring is recommended for all patients during treatment and observation. A cardiology consultation should be obtained for severe <span class=\"nowrap\">arrhythmias/ECG</span> changes. Correction of hypomagnesemia if present is also recommended.</p><p>Replacement of potassium may be insufficient to resolve an attack. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> has been reported to reverse weakness and hypokalemia in patients with thyrotoxic PP that is unresponsive to potassium administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/41,43,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43,59,60</a>]. These patients received doses of 1 mg of intravenous propranolol every 10 minutes up to a maximum dose of 3 mg. In one report, oral propranolol (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> administered without potassium supplementation reversed both weakness and hypokalemia in two patients with an acute attack of thyrotoxic PP without inducing rebound hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Propranolol, a beta adrenergic blocker, presumably reverses the excessive stimulation of the sodium-potassium ATPase and excessive drive of potassium into cells (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTIVE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restoration of euthyroidism eliminates attacks of thyrotoxic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,61</a>]. When patients become euthyroid, the electromyography (EMG) exercise test normalizes, and attacks are no longer inducible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Thyrotoxic PP can reemerge if thyrotoxicosis recurs. The management of hyperthyroidism differs according to the underlying etiology. In a series of 16 patients with thyrotoxic PP secondary to Graves&rsquo; disease who were followed for 14 years, treatment with radioactive iodine or surgery appeared to be more effective in preventing relapses than treatment with antithyroid drugs alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The administration of beta-blocking medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> (40 to 120 mg daily) with or without potassium supplementation has also been shown to decrease the frequency and severity of attacks, and may be used as a temporizing measure until a euthyroid state is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/17,19,51,59,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,51,59,64,65</a>]. A nonselective beta blocker (eg, propranolol) should be given; beta-1 selective agents are less likely to inhibit the beta-2 receptor-mediated hypokalemic effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and may therefore be less likely to prevent paralytic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In contrast to familial hypokalemic PP, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have not been shown to be of benefit in thyrotoxic PP and may even increase the frequency of attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Potassium supplementation is not effective as prophylaxis in thyrotoxic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As with hypokalemic PP, precipitating factors, such as heavy exercise, high-carbohydrate diets, and alcohol, should be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Patients should be on cardiac monitoring, and potassium levels should be monitored for potential rebound hyperkalemia for 24 hours.
