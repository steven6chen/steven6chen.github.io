A number of factors contribute to the HIV-infected patient's &quot;net state of immunosuppression&quot; including defects in cell-mediated immunity, B-cell dysfunction, and suboptimal humoral immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the absence of effective therapy, the immunocompromise is continually progressive. On the other hand, patients who respond to antiretroviral therapy (ART) have substantial increases in their CD4 cells, suggesting improved immunity.</p><p>Although vaccine efficacy is usually compromised in advanced disease, adequate responses can be achieved when vaccines are administered early after HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Concerns have been raised about vaccine safety, specifically the risk of activating the immune system and the potential for increasing HIV replication and promoting HIV infection. As discussed below, the benefits of administering vaccines appear to outweigh the risks.</p><p>Prevention of opportunistic infections is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Clinicians in other countries should refer to their national guidelines for recommendations regarding immunization of HIV-infected individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3322594092\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most data on vaccinations in HIV-infected individuals have examined immunogenicity rather than clinical efficacy. Overall, vaccines tend to be less immunogenic and antibody responses shorter-lived in the setting of HIV-infection. In general, protective antibodies are more likely elicited when vaccines are administered early in infection, prior to the decline in CD4 cell count, or after immune reconstitution and virologic suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p><p>Inactivated vaccines are generally safe and acceptable in HIV-infected individuals. Despite the greater immunogenicity in the setting of higher CD4 cell counts or virologic suppression with some vaccines, administration of inactivated vaccines does not have to be delayed if these have not yet been achieved; protective immunity with vaccination can be achieved in some patients despite immunosuppression, and the risk of infection is greatest in the setting of immunosuppression. However, if there was suboptimal antibody response to the initial vaccine, revaccination once immune reconstitution and virologic suppression has been achieved is recommended for certain vaccines.</p><p>Certain live vaccines have sufficient safety data and are thus recommended in HIV-infected patients who have CD4 cell percentage &ge;15 percent (if &lt;5 years old) or cell counts &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (if &ge;5 years old). Live vaccines should <strong>not</strong> be given to HIV-infected individuals with CD4 cell parameters below these thresholds because of the absence of safety data and the concern about vaccine-associated infection.</p><p>All standard childhood vaccinations in the United States can be given to HIV-infected or exposed children, although certain live vaccinations (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varicella vaccine</a> and measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR] vaccines) should be limited to individuals without severe immunosuppression (ie, CD4 cell percentage &ge;15 percent). HIV infection is an indication for meningococcal conjugate vaccination in infants and children.</p><p>Among adults, HIV-infected patients should receive the following categories of vaccines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inactivated vaccines recommended for the general adult population:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tetanus toxoid and reduced diphtheria toxoid with or without acellular pertussis vaccine (Td or TdaP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination (up to age 26 in HIV-infected patients, if not received previously)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccines for which HIV is itself an indication:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pneumococcal vaccination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine (if not already immune)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Meningococcal vaccination</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other vaccines are recommended for HIV-infected adults only if there is a specific indication or if there is evidence of no immunity:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine (if indicated)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Haemophilus influenzae </em>b vaccine (if indicated) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (if not already immune and CD4 cell count &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Varicella vaccine</a> (if not already immune and CD4 cell count &ge;200 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span></p><p/><p>Based on the results of one trial, zoster vaccine appears safe and immunogenic in HIV-infected adults with &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and virologic suppression on ART, but the optimal timing of vaccination is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Universal administration of tetanus toxoid and reduced diphtheria toxoid (Td) boosters every 10 years is also recommended because of waning immunity against tetanus and diphtheria over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Additionally, all pregnant women should receive vaccination against pertussis with Tdap during <strong>each</strong> pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination'</a>.)</p><p>Several studies have evaluated the immunogenicity of these vaccines in HIV-infected patients, but the results are difficult to compare because of the various vaccine formulations and schedules used. In general, immunogenicity appears somewhat lower and shorter-lived than that observed among the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>]. HIV-infected adults have similar antibody response to tetanus as an age-matched normal population, but diphtheria immunity is lower than expected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among those with advanced HIV infection, the response to immunization with both tetanus and diphtheria is lower compared with the general population, since the immune responses to tetanus and diphtheria are T cell-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>These vaccinations are safe among the HIV-infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In general, HIV-infected individuals older than two years should receive at least one dose of the 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Unless previously administered, the polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) should be given at least eight weeks after the PCV13, as a &quot;prime boost&quot; strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In addition, HIV-infected children ages 5 through 18 can receive a single dose of a conjugate Hib vaccine if they have not already been vaccinated. Hib vaccine is not specifically recommended for HIV-infected adults unless a separate specific indication (eg, asplenia) is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>As with other conjugate vaccines, antibody responses with the conjugate Hib vaccine in HIV-infected children have been disappointing. In one study, for example, only 37 percent of children seroconverted after administration of the Hib conjugate vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and another report noted a lesser antibody response than controls, particularly in children with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The duration of the antibody response in children is unknown. In the United States, however, Hib remains rare among HIV-infected children despite the suboptimal immune response, likely in part because of herd immunity conferred by routine Hib vaccination of all children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20</a>].</p><p>Similarly, the incidence of Hib disease in HIV-infected adults is fortunately low. Adults with advanced HIV disease do have a significantly increased rate of infection with <em>H. influenzae</em>, but most infections involve non-typeable strains for which the vaccine is not protective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3835785204\"><span class=\"h2\">Influenza vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Annual administration of the seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for all HIV-infected patients aged six months and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3,5,6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6,21</a>]. The inactivated vaccine formulation is recommended for the 2016 to 2017 influenza season; live, intranasal vaccines should <strong>not</strong> be used in HIV-infected patients. The specific schedule and inactivated vaccine components are the same as for the general population and are discussed elsewhere.

In a systematic review of studies evaluating the efficacy of influenza vaccination, the rate of influenza-like illness (in 13 studies) and laboratory confirmed influenza (in four studies) was lower among vaccinated compared with unvaccinated HIV-infected patients; the rate of influenza-like illness was comparable to that in vaccinated patients without immune compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The following studies were included in the analysis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a placebo-controlled trial of 102 HIV-infected patients, influenza vaccination resulted in significant reductions in respiratory symptoms (29 versus 49 percent) and laboratory-confirmed infection (0 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 328 patients who were advised to have influenza vaccine, vaccination was associated with a lower risk of subsequent laboratory-confirmed influenza among the 262 who agreed to immunization compared with the 66 who did not (relative risk 0.29) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>In some studies, antibody responses following standard-dose influenza vaccines have been lower in HIV-infected individuals than in immunocompetent hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. An important question is whether using a high-dose influenza vaccine will improve immunogenicity and efficacy in HIV-infected individuals. The question of immunogenicity was addressed in a randomized trial that compared a standard dose (15 mcg of antigen per strain) with a high dose (60 mcg per strain) of the inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine in HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Seroprotection rates following vaccination were significantly higher in the high-dose group for the H1N1 influenza A (96 versus 87 percent) and influenza B (91 versus 80 percent) components but not for H3N2 influenza A (96 versus 92 percent, a non-significant difference). Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of the high-dose influenza vaccine in HIV-infected adults. Intradermal delivery of influenza vaccine, another strategy to increase immunogenicity, did not improve seroconversion rates compared with intramuscular delivery in a trial of HIV-infected men in Thailand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

As an example, in a retrospective database study, the estimated annual incidence of invasive meningococcal infection in New York City between 2000 and 2011 was 0.39 cases per 100,000 persons overall and 3.4 per 100,000 persons among the HIV-infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Improved vaccine responses with two conjugate vaccine doses compared with one and waning immunity inform the recommended vaccine schedule.

Two conjugate vaccine doses resulted in higher rates of protective immune responses than a single dose, although the differences in rates decreased by 72 weeks post-vaccination; immune responses were poor among the small group of patients with CD4 cell percentage &lt;15 despite two doses.
