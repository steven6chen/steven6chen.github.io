Military clinicians working in surgical hospitals in Vietnam called it shock lung, while civilian clinicians referred to it as adult respiratory distress syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Subsequent recognition that individuals of any age could be afflicted led to the current term, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</p><p>ARDS is an acute, diffuse, inflammatory lung injury that leads to increased pulmonary vascular permeability, increased lung weight, and a loss of aerated tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Clinical hallmarks of ARDS are hypoxemia and bilateral radiographic opacities, while the pathological hallmark is diffuse alveolar damage (ie, alveolar edema with or without focal hemorrhage, acute inflammation of the alveolar walls, and hyaline membranes). </p><p>ARDS is associated with a variety of risk factors and etiologies. These conditions are grouped together under the term ARDS because the clinical, physiological features, pathological features, and management are similar regardless of the inciting event. </p><p>The clinical presentation, course, diagnostic evaluation, and diagnostic criteria of ARDS are reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, and management of ARDS are discussed separately.

Patients typically present with dyspnea, cyanosis (ie, hypoxemia), and diffuse crackles. Respiratory distress is usually evident, including tachypnea, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and use of accessory muscles of respiration. A cough and chest pain may also exist. </p><p>Arterial blood gases reveal hypoxemia, which is often accompanied by acute respiratory alkalosis and an elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-a-a-gradient-alveolar-arterial-gradient-aag\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). High concentrations of supplemental oxygen are generally required to maintain adequate oxygenation. </p><p>The initial chest radiograph typically has bilateral alveolar infiltrates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53014\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53014 \">image 1</a>), while computed tomography (CT) usually reveals widespread patchy or coalescent airspace opacities that are usually more apparent in the dependent lung zones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71931\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71931 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The infiltrates do not have to be diffuse or severe, as bilateral infiltrates of any severity are sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Clinical findings related to the precipitant may also exist at presentation. As an example, in patients with ARDS due to sepsis, there may be fever, hypotension, leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first several days of ARDS are characterized by hypoxemia requiring a moderate to high concentration of inspired oxygen. The bilateral alveolar infiltrates and diffuse crackles are persistent during this period and patients may be tenuous due to severe hypoxemia. </p><p>Most patients who survive this initial course begin to exhibit better oxygenation and decreasing alveolar infiltrates over the next several days. This may permit the amount of ventilatory support to be decreased and weaning to begin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation-readiness-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-of-weaning-from-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients, however, have persistent, severe hypoxemia and remain ventilator-dependent. Pulmonary proliferative changes and fibrosis may progressively replace the pathological findings of diffuse alveolar damage as early as ten days after the onset of the respiratory failure. The fibroproliferative phase of ARDS is characterized radiographically by progression from airspace opacification to a more coarsely reticular pattern of lung infiltration. These changes within the lung parenchyma are often accompanied by persistent hypoxemia, low lung compliance, high dead space, and sometimes by progressive pulmonary hypertension. The course may become dominated by persistent ventilator dependence and various complications.</p><p>The lungs of patients who survive the fibroproliferative phase enter into an extended subsequent phase of resolution and repair. Hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates gradually improve over weeks to months. Cardiopulmonary function often returns to near baseline levels by 6 months or longer after the initial lung injury. However, many survivors of severe ARDS are left with persistent cognitive impairment, emotional disturbances, and residual muscle weakness resulting in substantially reduced quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Some complications are related to mechanical ventilation (eg, pulmonary barotrauma, nosocomial pneumonia), while others are related to critical illness and being in the intensive care unit (eg, delirium, deep venous thrombosis, gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulceration, and catheter-related infections). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Barotrauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ARDS are predisposed to pulmonary barotrauma due to the physical stress of positive pressure mechanical ventilation on acutely damaged alveolar membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>It was previously common for patients with ARDS to develop single or multiple, sequential, loculated pneumothoraces. Clinical experience suggests that such complications are less common now that low tidal volume ventilation has become widespread. This is supported by the observations that (a) low tidal volume ventilation reduces the plateau airway pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and (b) a lower plateau airway pressure is associated with a lower incidence of pulmonary barotrauma. The latter was illustrated by a systematic review of 14 clinical studies (2270 patients with ARDS) that found a strong correlation between pulmonary barotrauma and a plateau airway pressure &gt;35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Radiographically apparent barotrauma sometimes occurs despite an appropriate mechanical ventilation strategy and can contribute to death in patients with other risk factors for a poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Deep sedation and pharmacologically-induced neuromuscular blockade are often used to treat agitated delirium. While these interventions may contribute to adverse outcomes such as prolongation of mechanical ventilation, persistent muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], and long-term impairments in cognition and short-term memory among survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], they may also optimize mechanical ventilation (ie, mitigate derecruitment associated with patient-ventilator dyssynchrony) and prevent dislodgment of the endotracheal tube and vascular catheters. One trial found that neuromuscular blockade was associated with improved survival in patients with severe ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The use of sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients is reviewed separately.

The difficulty identifying pneumonia in patients with ARDS was illustrated by an autopsy study that found pneumonia in 58 percent of patients with ARDS, although pneumonia was suspected antemortem in only 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Twenty percent of patients thought to have pneumonia did not have histologic evidence of pneumonia.</p><p>Despite the uncertainty about the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia among patients with ARDS, there is evidence that nosocomial pneumonia is more common among patients who are mechanically ventilated for ARDS than among patients who are mechanically ventilated for other reasons. This was demonstrated by an observational study of 243 consecutive patients who required mechanical ventilation, which found that patients with ARDS were significantly more likely to develop nosocomial pneumonia than patients without ARDS (55 versus 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A possible explanation for these findings is that patients with ARDS required a longer duration of mechanical ventilation.</p><p>The diagnosis, prevention, and management of nosocomial pneumonia are discussed separately.

Generally included are disorders that are known to cause diffuse alveolar damage and have the potential to resolve over time. Thus, viral or diffuse bacterial pneumonia and acute inhalational injuries are included, whereas eosinophilic pneumonia<strong> </strong>and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage associated with collagen vascular diseases are not. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is the primary alternative that needs to be excluded because it is common and can be clinically indistinguishable from ARDS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Excluding cardiogenic pulmonary edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An absence of cardiac exam abnormalities (eg, an S3 or S4 gallop, new or changed murmur), elevated right-sided filling pressures (eg, elevated jugular venous pressure), and certain radiographic abnormalities (eg, pulmonary venous congestion, Kerley B lines, cardiomegaly, and pleural effusions), helps distinguish ARDS from cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Several additional diagnostic tests may also be helpful, including measurement of plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels, echocardiography, and right heart catheterization:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) &ndash; A plasma BNP level below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> favors ARDS, but higher levels neither confirm heart failure nor exclude ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This derives from an observational study of patients with ARDS (n = 33) or cardiogenic pulmonary edema (n = 21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The study found that a plasma BNP level less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> identified ARDS with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 27, 95, 90, and 44 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography &ndash; Many clinicians use transthoracic echocardiography as the first-line diagnostic test if cardiogenic pulmonary edema cannot be excluded by clinical evaluation and measurement of the BNP level. While severe aortic or mitral valve dysfunction, severe diastolic dysfunction, or a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction favors cardiogenic pulmonary edema, the latter is insufficient to confirm primary cardiogenic pulmonary edema because some precipitants of ARDS (eg, septic shock) can cause an acute, severe cardiomyopathy that develops concomitantly with ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In addition, cardiogenic pulmonary edema cannot be excluded on the basis of an echocardiogram, since diastolic dysfunction and volume overload may exist even if the left heart function appears normal. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right heart catheterization &ndash; There is ample evidence that there is generally no value to routine right heart catheterization for either the diagnosis or management of ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. However, pulmonary artery catheterization may be considered if primary cardiogenic pulmonary edema cannot be excluded on the basis of the clinical evaluation, plasma BNP measurement, and echocardiogram. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute decompensated heart failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Swan-Ganz catheter'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Excluding other causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potentially treatable causes of ARDS and alternative forms of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates should be considered once cardiogenic pulmonary edema has been excluded. If such conditions cannot be identified on the basis of the clinical context and accompanying symptoms and signs, additional diagnostic testing should be performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive respiratory sampling &ndash; The lower respiratory tract can be sampled via tracheobronchial aspiration or mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (mini-BAL). Tracheobronchial aspiration is performed by advancing a catheter through the endotracheal tube until resistance is met and then applying suction, while mini-BAL is performed by advancing a catheter through the endotracheal tube until resistance is met, infusing sterile saline through the catheter, and then aspirating. Regardless of the technique, the specimen that is obtained may be evaluated via microscopic analysis (eg, Gram stain, cytology) and microbiologic culture; these studies may identify pneumonia or rapidly progressive cancer as the correct diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexible bronchoscopy &ndash; Flexible bronchoscopy can obtain lower respiratory samples for microscopic analysis and microbiologic culture if the noninvasive techniques are unsuccessful. It can also identify abnormalities that may not be detected with noninvasive sampling. Therefore, flexible bronchoscopy is a reasonable next step whenever noninvasive sampling is nondiagnostic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Consider the following examples of findings that suggest a specific etiology for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Frothy bloody secretions throughout the airways, increasing red blood cells in serial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages in the BAL fluid suggest diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. A large number of eosinophils in the BAL fluid suggest idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia. And, recovery of lipid-laden macrophages or recognizable food particles suggest aspiration pneumonitis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung biopsy &ndash; Surgical lung biopsy may be considered when alternative causes of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure cannot be excluded on the basis of the clinical context, symptoms, signs, and bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. The safety of lung biopsy in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure was demonstrated by a retrospective study of 57 patients with ARDS who underwent open lung biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The patients had a mean ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>)</span> of 145 mmHg and the rate of major complications was 7 percent, with no deaths attributed to the biopsy. Although the complication rate was 39 percent, most were tolerable (eg, persistent air leaks). The results of the biopsy resulted in the addition of specific therapy in 60 percent of patients and the withdrawal of unnecessary therapy in 37 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Generally speaking, we believe that lung biopsy should be reserved for carefully selected patients whose acute hypoxemic respiratory failure remains of uncertain etiology after nondiagnostic flexible bronchoscopy if one or more of the diagnostic possibilities under consideration might warrant targeted therapy or would substantially change the prognosis. Examples include cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, an acute fungal lung infection, an acute exacerbation of a chronic interstitial lung disease, vasculitis, or disseminated cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10171195\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2353770158\"><span class=\"h2\">Berlin definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ARDS can be diagnosed once cardiogenic pulmonary edema and alternative causes of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates have been excluded.

For such patients, the ratio of oxyhemoglobin saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) to FiO<sub>2</sub> is a reasonable substitute, according to a retrospective study of ABG measurements performed in adults receiving mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The study found that a SpO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> of 315 predicted a PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> of 300 (the threshold for ARDS) with a sensitivity of 91 percent and a specificity of 56 percent.</p><p>The Berlin Definition of ARDS (published in 2012) replaces the American-European Consensus Conference&rsquo;s definition of ARDS (published in 1994) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/16,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,38</a>]. The major changes to the Berlin Definition are that the term &ldquo;acute lung injury&rdquo; has been eliminated, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (ie, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) criterion has been removed, and minimal ventilator settings have been added. Despite these definitions, studies suggest that ARDS, in particular mild ARDS, remains under recognized by clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2353770152\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and ARDS has been described in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/35,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,40</a>]. In one autopsy study of 356 patients who met clinical criteria for ARDS at the time of death, when DAD was used as a reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the Berlin definition were 89 and 63 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Among patients meeting clinical criteria for ARDS, 45 percent had DAD on autopsy. The presence of DAD correlated with severity, being found in 12, 40, and 58 percent of those with mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively. DAD was found in 69 percent of patients with severe ARDS who met clinical criteria for &gt;72 hours. Pneumonia was the most common pathologic finding among patients who met clinical criteria for ARDS but did not have DAD. There is currently no readily available way to distinguish clinically between patients with and without histological DAD. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the presence or absence of DAD is clinically relevant to the treatment of individual patients with ARDS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10171357\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of alternative conditions may present as acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral alveolar infiltrates and, therefore, should be considered whenever ARDS is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is usually due to left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction, but may also be due to fluid overload, severe hypertension, renal artery stenosis, or severe renal disease. Its presentation is nearly identical to ARDS, except there may be evidence of cardiac dysfunction (eg, an S3 or S4 gallop, new or changed murmur), elevated right-sided filling pressures (eg, elevated jugular venous pressure), or related radiographic abnormalities (eg, pulmonary venous congestion, Kerley B lines, cardiomegaly, and pleural effusions). Distinguishing cardiogenic pulmonary edema from ARDS can be aided by measurement of a brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, echocardiography, and, less often, right heart catheterization. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Excluding cardiogenic pulmonary edema'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute decompensated heart failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or other chronic interstitial lung diseases can closely resemble ARDS in both clinical presentation and chest radiographic abnormalities. Like ARDS, the pathological findings are dominated by diffuse alveolar damage, but the prognosis is substantially worse. This diagnostic possibility is easily overlooked in patients whose underlying interstitial lung disease is unknown or mild or moderate in severity. The diagnosis is suggested by careful review of previous chest radiographic images, by discovery of subpleural reticular changes intermixed with alveolar opacities on a chest CT scan obtained shortly after onset of ARDS, or by surgical lung biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Acute exacerbations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage may be associated with a large, otherwise unexplained drop in the hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. While hemoptysis may be minimal or absent, bronchoscopy often reveals frothy bloody secretions throughout the airways and invariably detects an increasing amount of red blood cells in serial bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. The recovery of hemosiderin-laden macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is strongly suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-diffuse-alveolar-hemorrhage-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia (IAEP) occurs in previously healthy individuals and is characterized by cough, fever, dyspnea, and sometimes chest pain. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens always contain a large number of eosinophils, typically 35 to 55 percent of all recovered cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

The most common features at presentation are a persistent nonproductive cough, dyspnea with exertion, and weight loss. Bronchoalveolar lavage usually contains a smaller proportion of macrophages and higher proportions of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils than healthy patients. This &quot;mixed pattern&quot; of increased cellularity is thought to be characteristic of COP. The diagnosis is made by ruling out infectious causes of pneumonia and documenting typical pathologic changes in tissue obtained by open lung biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute interstitial pneumonia (Hamman-Rich syndrome) is a rare and fulminant form of diffuse lung injury that has a presentation similar to ARDS. Many people consider acute interstitial pneumonia a subset of idiopathic ARDS since its clinical manifestations are similar and both demonstrate diffuse alveolar damage on histopathology. The distinguishing characteristic is that ARDS is often associated with a known risk factor, whereas acute interstitial pneumonia is not. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-interstitial-pneumonia-hamman-rich-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute interstitial pneumonia (Hamman-Rich syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer can disseminate through the lungs so rapidly that the ensuing respiratory failure may be mistaken for ARDS. This is most often due to lymphoma or acute leukemia, but lymphangitic spread of solid tumors occasionally behaves this way.

These findings usually begin within 48 to 72 hours of the inciting event and then rapidly worsen. High concentrations of supplemental oxygen are generally needed.

The amount of ventilatory support required may decrease and weaning may begin. Some patients, however, have persistent interstitial infiltrates and remain ventilator-dependent. Development of pulmonary fibrosis may follow and the clinical course may become dominated by persistent ventilator dependence and various complications (eg, pulmonary barotrauma, nosocomial pneumonia).
