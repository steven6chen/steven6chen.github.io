(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Spinal immobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First responders should suspect a spinal column injury in every trauma victim, especially in the setting of a motor vehicle collision, assault, fall from a height, or sports-related injury. For any patient with a possible cervical spine injury, spinal immobilization should be initiated at the scene. This typically includes a backboard, rigid cervical collar, and lateral head supports. Prehospital management of the trauma patient, including techniques for spine immobilization, is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Trauma victims may not think clearly due to head injury, shock, or drug or alcohol intoxication, making cooperation difficult and spinal movement likely. In some cases chemical sedation and, rarely, even airway management may be needed to prevent self-injury. </p><p>Some form of cervical spine immobilization and protection should be maintained until an unstable spinal injury is excluded using a validated assessment instrument or appropriate diagnostic imaging. However, upon arrival at the hospital and for long transports, we recommend removing the patient from the backboard and placing them on a stretcher to prevent potential complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Spinal injury is uncommon in patients with penetrating trauma, and rare in those without evidence of neurologic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This lower risk and the possibility of harm from immobilization have led some experts to question the need for spinal immobilization in patients with penetrating trauma who do not manifest neurologic deficits or altered mental status. However, first responders and emergency clinicians must remain cautious when they consider removing spinal immobilization in this setting because victims of penetrating trauma may simultaneously sustain blunt head or neck trauma during an assault. This issue is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penetrating-neck-injuries-initial-evaluation-and-management#H932876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penetrating neck injuries: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Cervical spine immobilization'</a>.)</p><p>Cervical spine injuries are uncommon in cases of self-hanging. Morbidity is primarily due to asphyxiation with cerebral anoxia or soft tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Spinal column injury from hanging is seen in executions involving a drop from a height against a knotted rope.</p><p>The heads of children less than eight years of age are somewhat large in proportion to their bodies, resulting in neck flexion when they are placed supine on a standard backboard. To avoid this, a special backboard with an occipital recess may be used or a rolled sheet can be placed under the child's upper back. Immobilization and protection of the cervical spine in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It should be noted that while the backboard often used for spinal immobilization is helpful for extricating trauma patients from vehicles, there is no high quality evidence demonstrating that it prevents spinal injury or improves outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Observational evidence suggests that backboards and cervical collars may be associated with complications, such as decubitus pressure ulcers, respiratory compromise, and altered examination findings, and therefore we recommend that trauma patients be removed from their backboard as quickly as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Helmet removal</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motorcycle helmet removal &ndash; Safe removal of a motorcycle helmet requires that manual cervical spine immobilization be maintained continuously, and this can only be done with <strong>TWO</strong> people. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The technique is performed as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Open any face shield to assess, and if necessary, assist the patient's airway and breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The first rescuer, positioned above the head, places one palm along each side of the helmet with fingers on the mandible to prevent head movement.

A careful evaluation for potential spinal column injuries is performed as part of the secondary survey. Resuscitation of the trauma patient is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The different types of spinal column injuries are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The emergency clinician should anticipate airway management problems in patients with cervical spinal column injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Unstable lesions above C3 may cause immediate respiratory paralysis, and lower cervical lesions may cause delayed phrenic nerve paralysis from ascending edema of the spinal cord. Cervical spinal column injury may be associated with airway obstruction from retropharyngeal hemorrhage, edema, or maxillofacial trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>According to the American College of Surgeons' ATLS guidelines, orotracheal intubation is the preferred method of airway management for patients with traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest, even with evidence of spinal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Orotracheal intubation in conjunction with rapid sequence intubation is recommended for patients who are breathing but unconscious and in need of airway control or ventilatory support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In-line spinal stabilization should be maintained throughout the procedure to minimize spinal column movement and reduce the risk of causing or exacerbating a spinal cord injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The authors of one review of in-line spinal stabilization question the technique's utility, pointing out that data supporting the technique come from cadaver studies, observations on uninjured volunteers, and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. They find little evidence to support the contention that orotracheal intubation without in-line stabilization is unsafe in spinal column injury patients. In addition, in-line stabilization impairs the clinician's view when direct laryngoscopy is performed, increasing the risk for failed intubation and severe hypoxemia, which are associated with poor outcomes in central nervous system injury.</p><p>Despite the dearth of supporting evidence, we believe clinicians should continue to use in-line stabilization whenever they intubate a patient with a possible spinal column injury until compelling scientific data from randomized trials demonstrate its ineffectiveness. However, the preeminent concern is to protect the airway and oxygenate the patient, and some loss of in-line stabilization is acceptable if necessary to accomplish these ends. The potential difficulty caused by in-line stabilization during laryngoscopy has become less important with the increasing use of video laryngoscopes and other sophisticated airway management tools that improve the clinician's view of the larynx while reducing cervical spine motion.

Clinicians must assume that hypotension following trauma results from hemorrhage. Nevertheless, neurogenic shock from spinal cord injury (usually to the superior portion of the spinal cord) may cause hypotension and bradycardia. Neurogenic shock and the management of trauma-related shock are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Transient paralysis and spinal shock'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Secondary survey</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The secondary survey includes a careful inspection of the patient's entire body, beginning with the head. The secondary survey is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929825\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Secondary evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Some authorities claim that signs of injury above the clavicles are associated with an increased risk of cervical spinal column injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Based on case series, approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients with significant head and facial trauma sustain associated cervical spine injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Other studies call this association into question, and emphasize the importance of physiologic indicators, such as depressed neurologic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one retrospective series of 447 consecutive patients with moderate or severe head injury, those with a Glasgow Coma Score below 8 were more likely to have sustained a cervical spine injury (odds ratio [OR] 2.77; 95% CI 1.11-7.73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>During the secondary survey, the entire spine and paraspinal musculature should be palpated for areas of tenderness or deformity; a step-off in the spine may indicate vertebral subluxation or fracture. Widening of an interspinous space indicates a tear in the posterior ligament complex and a potentially unstable spinal injury, although this finding is difficult to appreciate.</p><p>A focused but systematic neurologic evaluation should be performed in all patients with a possible spine injury. Clinicians should assess the presence and symmetry of both voluntary and involuntary movements. As examples, priapism may occur with severe spinal cord injury, and an abnormal breathing pattern may indicate a cervical injury, as the diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. During the neurologic examination, particular attention should be paid to the symmetry of peripheral strength, sensation, reflexes, and proprioception. Any sensory deficits, including the dermatome where they occur, should be noted. Bowel or bladder incontinence is an important finding. Comprehensive summaries of the neurologic examination are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children#H10928992\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detailed neurologic assessment of infants and children&quot;, section on 'Neurologic examination'</a>.)</p><p>Although previous iterations of Advanced Trauma Life Support advocated performing a digital rectal examination on all trauma patients during the secondary survey, there is no clear evidence that the examination is an accurate means for detecting spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. In specific circumstances, such as pelvic trauma, the rectal examination may provide useful clinical information about the trauma patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Certain conditions predispose patients to cervical spinal column injury, and thus it is important to obtain the past medical history. As examples, Down syndrome patients are predisposed to atlanto-occipital dislocation and patients with rheumatoid arthritis are prone to rupture of the transverse ligament of C2.

The approach we describe here is based upon available studies and our clinical experience. An algorithm outlining the basic approach is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93206\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93206 \">algorithm 1</a>). In all cases of suspected spinal column injury, immobilization of the spine must be maintained until an unstable injury is ruled out. Unstable injuries are listed in the table and discussed in greater detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52922 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemodynamically unstable trauma patients often proceed rapidly to the operating room. These patients are presumed to have an unstable cervical spine injury and spinal immobilization is maintained until radiographic evaluation, generally by computed tomography (CT), can be performed postoperatively.</p><p>For patients who have sustained major trauma and are undergoing CT imaging to assess for internal injury of the head, chest, or abdomen, we perform CT of the cervical spine.</p><p>In cases of less severe trauma, the history, physical examination, and clinical decision rules are used to determine what spinal imaging is necessary. In most cases, plain radiographs (three-views) are indicated and may be preferred over CT because of decreased radiation exposure and cost. CT imaging should be obtained if abnormalities are identified on plain radiographs or suspicion for injury persists despite the absence of such abnormal findings or adequate plain radiographs cannot be obtained. CT imaging is also obtained for patients with symptoms or abnormal neurologic examination findings referable to the cervical spine.</p><p>Both clinical decision rules (NEXUS and Canadian C-spine rule) used to determine the need for cervical spine imaging have been well studied but they must be applied appropriately. Among the patients excluded from the studies performed to develop these rules were those with direct blows to the neck, penetrating trauma, and for the Canadian C-spine rules children under 16 years. Clinicians must use clinical judgment to determine the need for imaging in these settings. Cervical spine injuries are uncommon in patients with penetrating trauma who do not manifest neurologic deficits or altered mental status, but neither clinical decision rule may be used to exclude such injuries. Spine injury in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who sustain a minor fall or collision but nevertheless are at increased risk for spinal column injury and often warrant imaging include those with severe osteoporosis, advanced arthritis, cancer, and degenerative bone disease. Imaging is prudent if disproportionate midline neck or back pain, focal spine tenderness, upper extremity paresthesias, or other suggestive symptoms are present.</p><p>If a fracture of the cervical spine is identified in a blunt trauma patient, there is a significant chance that additional fractures of the spinal column are present and the entire spinal column should be evaluated with diagnostic imaging. This issue is discussed separately.

In an effort to standardize clinical practice and guide physicians to be more selective in their use of radiographs without jeopardizing patient care, two clinical decision rules have been developed. Both the NEXUS Low-risk Criteria and the Canadian C-spine rule are well validated and sensitive, and either can be used to determine the need for cervical spine imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7764600\"><span class=\"h4\">NEXUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first decision rule to be developed was the NEXUS Low-risk Criteria (NLC), which was prospectively validated in a large, multicenter, observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. All patients with blunt trauma who underwent radiography of the cervical spine at any of the 21 participating emergency departments were included.</p><p>The NLC decision instrument stipulates that radiography is <strong>not </strong>necessary if patients satisfy ALL five of the following low-risk criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of posterior midline cervical tenderness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal level of alertness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No evidence of intoxication</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No abnormal neurologic findings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No painful distracting injuries</p><p/><p>Insignificant injuries were defined as those that would not lead to any consequences if left undiagnosed. The NEXUS investigators evaluated 34,069 blunt trauma patients who underwent radiography of the cervical spine comprised of either a three-view cervical spine radiograph or a cervical spine computed tomography (CT) scan. Of these patients, 818 (2.4 percent) had sustained a cervical spinal column injury. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) of the NLC were found to be 99.6 percent (95% CI 98.6-100), 12.9 percent (95% CI 12.8-13.0), and 99.9 percent (95% CI 99.8-100), respectively.</p><p>According to the NLC researchers, examples of a &quot;painful distracting injury&quot; include long bone fractures, visceral injury requiring surgical consultation, large lacerations, crush injuries, and large burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. They add that an emergency clinician may categorize any injury thought &quot;to have the potential to impair the patient's ability to appreciate other injuries&quot; as a painful distracting injury.</p><p>Some researchers believe that the presence of a painful distracting injury does not limit the accuracy of a clinical assessment of the cervical spine performed in an alert trauma patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], but we feel such a conclusion is premature. In a study that assessed each of the NLC criteria, the authors noted that a substantial number of patients with a significant cervical spinal column injury met only one criterion, including 39 with only a distracting injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this study, the overall sensitivity of the NLC for detecting cervical injury declined to 93.5 percent when painful distracting injury was removed from the list of criteria. </p><p>Elder trauma patients are at higher risk of cervical spine injury and the NLC do not apply to this population (patients over 60 years were excluded from the original study population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. A low threshold should be used to determine the need for imaging studies in geriatric trauma patients. According to a prospective study comparing the NLC in 320 elder (age &gt;65; median = 75) versus 2465 non-elder (median age = 36) blunt trauma patients, sensitivity for cervical spine fracture was 65.9 percent in the older group and 84.2 in the younger group, using CT as the gold-standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The authors concluded that the NLC is not appropriate for assessment of the elder population.

These researchers subsequently developed the Canadian C-spine rule (CCR), based upon three clinical questions derived from 25 clinical variables associated with spine injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The CCR involves the following steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condition One: Perform radiography in patients with any of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age 65 years or older</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dangerous mechanism of injury: fall from 1 m (3 feet) or five stairs; axial load to the head, such as diving accident; motor vehicle crash at high speed (&gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">km/hour</span> [&gt;62 mph]); motorized recreational vehicle accident; ejection from a vehicle; bicycle collision with an immovable object, such as tree or parked car</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paresthesias in the extremities</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condition Two: In patients with none of the high risk characteristics listed in Condition One above, assess for any low-risk factor that allows for safe assessment of neck range of motion.

In 2003, the CCR was prospectively studied in the emergency departments of nine Canadian tertiary care hospitals. Of 8283 patients, 162 were found to have clinically significant injuries, and the sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values of the CCR were respectively 99.4 percent (95% CI 96-100), 45.1 percent (95% CI 44-46), and 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The investigators reported that the CCR would have missed one patient with a clinically important cervical spine injury, while the NLC would have missed 16. The CCR has also been validated in larger hospital-based studies and in an out-of-hospital study of paramedics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7764614\"><span class=\"h4\">NEXUS versus Canadian C-spine rule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both the NEXUS Low-risk Criteria and the Canadian C-spine rule are well validated and sensitive, and either can be used to determine the need for cervical spine imaging. Nevertheless, controversy persists about which of the two rules is more specific and more useful.</p><p>In contrast to NEXUS, where the NLC had a sensitivity of 99.6 percent and specificity of 12.9 percent, in a subsequent Canadian study the NLC demonstrated a lower sensitivity of 90.7 percent and a higher specificity of 36.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These discrepancies may stem from differences in study design. As an example, inclusion criteria differ for the two trials: the Canadian group excluded those under the age of 16 years and subjects with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of less than 15, whereas these subjects were included among the NEXUS cohort. In addition, NEXUS investigators excluded all patients in whom radiographs were deemed unnecessary, while the Canadian investigators included such individuals. Thus, selection bias may account for the lower number of false negatives and true negatives reported in the Canadian study, potentially inflating both the sensitivity and specificity of the CCR. Finally, the prospective validation phase of the CCR study was performed in the same institutions in which the derivation phase was performed, raising concerns about improved performance due to familiarity with the rule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain radiographs versus CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We believe it is reasonable to use plain radiographs to assess for cervical spinal column injury in patients without a severe mechanism of injury or neurologic abnormalities, in whom adequate radiographs are likely to be obtainable, and in whom CT imaging for other potential injuries is not planned. Routine cervical spine radiographs for trauma must include anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and odontoid (ie, open-mouth) views at a minimum. Adequate views are essential. Depending upon the patient population, up to 72 percent of plain films may be inadequate to visualize the complete cervical spine, necessitating performance of a CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Once a CT is performed, plain radiographs add no further clinically relevant information and should not be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Although controlled trials comparing plain radiographs to CT in elder trauma patients and others likely to have abnormal cervical anatomy (eg, advanced arthritis) have not been performed, plain radiographs can be difficult to interpret in such cases and CT may be preferable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As an example, elder trauma patients are more likely to sustain type II odontoid fractures and plain films sometimes fail to provide optimal views of the atlanto-axial joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. As another example, distraction and rotational injuries resulting in atlanto-occipital dislocations can be difficult to diagnose with plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition to the greater accuracy of CT in such cases, the long-term risks from increased radiation exposure are of less concern in elder patients.</p><p>While the lateral view of the cervical spine is most helpful in diagnosing spinal injuries, it is inadequate when used alone, detecting only 60 to 80 percent of cervical spine fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Diagnostic yield increases substantially when AP and odontoid views are added. All three views must be evaluated for adequacy and the presence of abnormal findings before cervical spine immobilization is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In most cases, oblique views provide no important additional information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4610880\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of plain radiographs'</a> below.)</p><p>The C7 vertebra may be obscured in muscular or obese patients, as well as patients with spinal lesions that cause paralysis of the muscles that depress the shoulders. If so, the shoulders can be lowered by pulling the patient's hands toward their feet, using slow steady traction. Movement should occur only at the shoulder girdle while the head and neck remain immobilized. If this maneuver is unsuccessful or difficult to perform because of upper extremity injuries, a transaxillary (or &quot;swimmer's&quot;) view of the lower cervical vertebrae may be helpful. A CT scan is obtained if visualization of the cervical spine remains inadequate despite these additional maneuvers and views.</p><p>The NEXUS study found that a technically adequate three-view trauma series fails to diagnose spinal injury in only 0.07 percent of patients with injuries (95% CI 0.05-0.09) and in only 0.008 percent of patients with unstable injures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Furthermore, some researchers claim that too many CT studies are being performed in trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. They emphasize the cancer risk, particularly among children, from increased radiation exposure with CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Radiation is discussed further below. (See <a href=\"#H7764070\" class=\"local\">'CT for cervical spinal column injury'</a> below.)</p><p>Nevertheless, the NEXUS study involved patients with minor trauma and studies in more severely injured patients suggest that plain radiographs can have limitations. According to one retrospective case series of blunt trauma patients, plain radiographs may be inadequate to visualize the complete cervical spine in up to 72 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Plain radiographs, even when swimmer's and oblique views are performed, are often inadequate and may miss up to 16 percent of cervical spine fractures in severely injured, obtunded blunt trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4610880\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation of plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If plain radiographs are used to assess the cervical spine, the clinician must be certain that the views obtained are adequate and systematically examined. On the lateral view, the entire cervical spine, from the base of the occiput to the top of the first thoracic vertebra must be clearly visible. On the odontoid view, the dens and both lateral masses must be clearly visible. Inadequate views are <strong>not</strong> acceptable.</p><p>Once adequate views are obtained, examine each for alignment of the vertebrae; appearance, position, and spacing between vertebrae; and appearance of the soft tissues.

Loss of cervical lordosis is not associated with injury and by itself should not prevent clinicians from clearing a trauma patient&rsquo;s cervical spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7764434\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging of patients at higher risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT imaging should ordinarily be obtained for patients who do not meet criteria for clinical clearance based on the NEXUS or Canadian decision rules, as well as those patients involved in high-energy trauma or otherwise at significant risk of cervical spine injury, as described above.

Practice guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) recommend that CT from the occiput to the first thoracic vertebra, including sagittal and coronal reconstructions, be used as the primary method of screening for cervical trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Systematic reviews of studies comparing plain radiography and CT in the detection of cervical spinal column injury following blunt trauma have found CT to be far superior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. According to one review, the pooled sensitivity for detecting cervical spine injury was 52 percent for plain radiography (95% CI 47-56) while for CT it was 98 percent (95% CI 96-99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Studies were included in the review if they contained data on the performance of both plain radiography and CT.</p><p>This review is limited by several factors. Patient entry criteria varied widely among the studies, which likely contributed to the relatively high overall prevalence of cervical spinal column injury (range of 5 to 23 percent). As an example, some studies included only patients admitted to intensive care or with altered mental status. Therefore, conclusions drawn from this population, with its higher injury rate, may not apply to more typical trauma populations being screened for cervical injury. Heterogeneity tests suggest that significant differences exist among the included studies in their measurement of the sensitivity of plain radiography.</p><p>CT was found to be highly sensitive and specific for cervical spine injury in a prospective, multicenter observational study involving 10,276 patients with blunt trauma who did not meet the NEXUS criteria for clinical clearance of the cervical spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In this trial, the sensitivity and specificity for a clinically significant injury (n = 198; significant injury defined as requiring surgery or placement of a halo or cervical-thoracic brace) were 98.5 and 91 percent, respectively, with three false negative CT (0.03 percent) studies, all of whom had focal neurologic findings during their initial examination consistent with central cord syndrome. </p><p>CT appears to outperform plain radiography as a screening test for patients at high risk of cervical spine injury and thus should be the initial study obtained in patients with altered mental status or severe non-spinal injury. One research group found CT to be more cost-effective than plain radiography among patients whose probability of cervical spine injury is greater than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Subsequently, another group developed and validated a clinical decision rule using three injury mechanisms and three clinical parameters to identify high-risk patients that warrant imaging of the cervical spine with CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H7763589\" class=\"local\">'Imaging of patients not at high risk'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to improved sensitivity in high-risk patients, CT scanning may be more efficient than plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. A retrospective review suggests that blunt trauma patients with a normal motor examination and a normal cervical spine CT do not require further assessment with MRI before clearing the cervical spine of bony and ligamentous injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. CT also enables clinicians to assess for nonspinal injuries simultaneously and rapidly.</p><p>The primary disadvantage of CT is increased radiation. Compared with conventional radiography of the cervical spine, helical CT substantially increases the mean radiation dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Researchers who precisely measured radiation exposure in 12 patients undergoing imaging of the cervical spine found a tenfold increase in the radiation dose to the skin (28 versus 2.89 mGy) and a 14-fold increase in the dose to the thyroid (26 versus 1.8 mGy) among those studied with CT compared with standard radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Radiation risk generally and in children is discussed separately.

Although CT detects 97 to 100 percent of all fractures, its accuracy in the detection of purely ligamentous injuries is not well studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

In addition, debate continues about the clinical significance of many of the injuries that are detected by MRI. Other problems arise from the delays associated with MRI. When MRI is used to clear the cervical spine of soft tissue injuries, particularly in obtunded patients, these patients are subjected to prolonged spinal immobilization, which increases the risk for substantial morbidity and makes patient care more difficult. Although studies of these issues are limited, prolonged spinal immobilization is associated with an increased risk for the following problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilator associated pneumonia and other infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delirium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure ulcers of the skin, possibly involving the occiput, chin, shoulders, and back &ndash; Incidence ranges from 6.8 to 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboembolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty with intubation and airway management</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty obtaining central venous access</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty providing enteral nutrition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited physical therapy</p><p/><p>MRI also brings the risks associated with the transport of sick patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

True SCIWORA is seldom associated with permanent neurologic injury in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]; however, pure cervical spinal subluxation may occur when the ligamentous complexes rupture without an associated bony injury.</p><p>Such injuries often begin posteriorly in the nuchal ligament and proceed anteriorly to involve other ligaments. The scout film of the CT scan or a plain lateral radiograph with the neck in the neutral position may show widening of both the interspinous and intervertebral spaces posteriorly. However, these findings are often subtle and can be missed. Degenerative changes of the spinal column and spinal stenosis may be risk factors for ligamentous injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7763729\"><span class=\"h3\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCIWORA is thought by some to occur primarily in children.

Most SCIWORA injuries occurred in older patients and involved minor mechanisms; SCIWORA injuries in younger patients generally involved high-energy mechanisms.</p><p/><p>The reasons for the discrepancies in the reported rates of SCIWORA among adults remain unclear. Increased rates may reflect a true increase in incidence or an increase in reporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. Furthermore, the definition of SCIWORA varies among studies. Some define SCIWORA as any spinal cord injury not seen on plain radiograph or CT, while others believe SCIWORA should refer only to patients with a clinical spinal cord injury and no neuroimaging abnormality, including MRI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest obtaining an MRI if there is concern about a possible isolated ligamentous injury or spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) of the cervical spine in either alert or obtunded patients. We recommend <strong>NOT</strong> using flexion-extension studies in obtunded patients, and prefer MRI in alert patients. The limitations of flexion-extension imaging are described below. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Flexion-extension radiographs'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinicians should suspect a cervical ligamentous injury in an alert patient if severe neck pain, persistent midline tenderness, upper extremity paresthesias, or focal neurologic findings (eg, upper extremity weakness) are present despite a normal CT scan.</p><p>The use of MRI for clearance following a negative CT is supported by several studies including a prospective study performed at a level one trauma center of consecutive alert patients who experienced persistent midline cervical tenderness following their initial ED evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Of the 178 eligible patients, 38 were reported to have soft tissue cervical spine injuries identified by MRI that needed intervention, including five that required surgical fusion.</p><p>In the adult patient who is obtunded or has a persistently altered mental status and whose CT and plain radiographs demonstrate no fracture, controversy exists about the best method to determine whether the cervical spine is free of unstable ligamentous injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/48,50,74-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50,74-77</a>]. There are two possible approaches. One approach uses only a multidetector CT (MDCT) scan, and a normal result is considered sufficient to clear the cervical spine of injury. This may be a viable option if suspicion for an isolated ligamentous injury is relatively low and access to MRI is limited, or if the local radiologist has expertise reading MDCT scans of the cervical spine and appropriate studies (eg, MDCT with &ge;64 slices; axial slices less than 3 mm) are obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The alternative approach involves obtaining an MRI to rule out soft tissue injury, even after a negative study using MDCT. The authors of several systematic reviews and practice guidelines have struggled to provide guidance about the best approach in part due to the limitations and heterogeneity of available studies.</p><p>Some researchers believe that significant cervical ligamentous injuries can be missed in unconscious trauma patients and those with altered mental status unless an MRI is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/68,74,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,74,79</a>]. A meta-analysis of 11 prospective and retrospective studies found that MRI identified 182 cervical spine abnormalities, of which 96 led to substantial changes in management, among 1550 patients whose initial CT scan of the cervical spine was negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, it should be noted that this meta-analysis did not include any randomized trials that directly compared CT and MRI to CT alone. Moreover, there is no gold standard against which to measure a radiologist's interpretation of CT and MRI studies, and the determination of spinal instability requiring surgery can be controversial. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of CT for cervical spine injury continues to improve with advances in technology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other researchers believe that a normal imaging study using an advanced MDCT scanner (&ge;64 slices) and appropriate technique is sufficiently sensitive and specific to rule out any unstable injury of the cervical spine, whether bony or ligamentous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In the largest study included in the meta-analysis described above, a normal CT ruled out unstable injury in all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. MRI revealed four patients with a stable ligamentous injury (all were limited to a single column of the cervical spine) and seven patients with cervical cord contusions. A subsequent meta-analysis of 17 studies involving 14,327 patients assessed the effectiveness of modern multislice helical CT for detecting acute unstable cervical spine injure and reported a sensitivity and a specificity &gt;99.9 percent (95% CI 99-100 and 99-100, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The authors concluded that modern CT imaging alone is sufficient to detect unstable cervical spine injuries. A systematic review by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) included five studies that used axial CT slices of less than 3 mm to assess obtunded adult trauma patients (follow-up was completed for 1017 patients) and no unstable injuries were missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Another systematic review included a separate analysis of seven higher quality studies, defined by their prospective design, low risk of bias, and use of more sophisticated CT imaging and interpretation, involving 1686 patients and reported no missed cervical spine injuries of clinical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Other reviews have reached similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>], but many researchers have raised questions about cost-effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>] and caution about the limitations of available evidence (eg, heterogeneity of methods).</p><p>It should be noted that one meta-analysis described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>] included seven of the same studies used in a prior review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], yet reached the opposite conclusion. The disparate conclusions may be attributable to the addition of 10 studies, involving an additional 12,777 patients, in which the prevalence of unstable cervical spine injuries was extremely low. Nevertheless, more recent studies appear to support the use of MDCT for clearance of the cervical spine in the obtunded patient. Notably, the practice management guidelines from EAST recommend cervical collar removal after a negative, high-quality CT study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Performing an MRI entails risks to the unresponsive patient, including aspiration, secondary brain injury, and the increased difficulty of monitoring and performing a resuscitation in the MRI suite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/50,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,83,84</a>]. The financial cost of performing an MRI in all unresponsive blunt trauma patients is also substantial, particularly given that unstable injuries are uncommon in the setting of a negative CT. However, MRI does not subject the patient to ionizing radiation. The risks associated with the prolonged cervical spine immobilization are described separately. (See <a href=\"#H7764113\" class=\"local\">'MRI for cervical spinal column injury'</a> above.)</p><p>Regardless of the method employed, clearance of the cervical spine should be performed as soon as possible (ideally within 48 hours) in obtunded patients. Prolonged use of a hard cervical collar increases the difficulty of pulmonary toilet and the risk for developing occipital decubitus ulcers. In addition, findings associated with soft tissue injury (eg, edema) may resolve if studies are delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Flexion-extension radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the obtunded patient, flexion-extension <span class=\"nowrap\">(F/E)</span> radiographs perform inadequately for the assessment of blunt cervical spine injury and we recommend that they <strong>NOT</strong> be used in this circumstance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/37,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,50</a>].

If a spinal column injury is deemed unstable, hospital admission and spine surgery consultation is mandatory. If consultation is not available onsite, immediate transfer must be arranged to a center that can provide these services. Patients with unstable fractures have commonly sustained multisystem trauma, and the extent of their other injuries determines whether they require admission to an intensive care unit or other monitored setting.</p><p>Conservative treatment of cervical fractures consists of closed reduction under fluoroscopic guidance and halo-vest immobilization. The halo is constructed of graphite or metal and is secured to the frontal and parietal areas of the skull with metal pins. The halo is the most common device applied for treatment of unstable cervical and upper thoracic fractures and dislocations as low as T3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>If plain radiographs or CT demonstrate minor spinal fracture patterns and there is no neurologic deficit, then outpatient management may be possible. Isolated transverse process fractures identified by CT appear to be one example of fractures suitable for conservative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]. Treatment should include analgesics, and follow-up care should be arranged in all instances because even minor spinal column injuries may be associated with prolonged disability.

Spinal immobilization, including backboard, rigid cervical collar, and lateral head supports for transport, should be initiated at the scene, and immobilization should be maintained until an unstable spinal injury is excluded. Techniques for safe helmet removal are described above. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prehospital management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The priorities of trauma management do not change in the setting of potential spinal column injury. Anticipate airway management problems in patients with cervical spinal column injury. Unstable lesions above C3 may cause immediate respiratory paralysis and lower cervical lesions may cause delayed respiratory distress. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Emergency department (ED) management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of spinal cord injury is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have sustained major trauma or are otherwise at high risk for cervical spinal column injury, we suggest performing a CT scan of the entire cervical spine. An algorithm outlining our basic approach to imaging is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93206\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93206 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Overview of imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7764070\" class=\"local\">'CT for cervical spinal column injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the obtunded adult patient, we suggest that flexion-extension imaging <strong>NOT</strong> be used to assess for a possible isolated ligamentous injury or SCIWORA of the cervical spine. While MRI remains our preferred test to rule out isolated ligamentous injury or SCIWORA of the cervical spine in the unconscious, unevaluable patient, there is increasing evidence supporting the use of advanced CT imaging with appropriate technique in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for ligamentous injury and SCIWORA'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Flexion-extension radiographs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cases of less severe trauma, the history, physical examination, and clinical decision rules are used to determine if spinal imaging is necessary. Both the NEXUS Low-risk Criteria and the Canadian C-spine rule are well validated and sensitive. We suggest that either the NEXUS Low-risk Criteria or the Canadian C-spine rule be used to determine the need for cervical spine imaging in appropriate patients. The characteristics and implementation of each rule are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical decision rules for obtaining radiographs'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury#H7762768\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of thoracic and lumbar spinal column injury&quot;, section on 'Decision rules for imaging thoracic or lumbar spine injury'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We believe either plain radiographs or CT are acceptable to screen patients without a severe mechanism of injury, neurologic abnormalities, or concerning examination findings who are otherwise at low risk for cervical spinal column injury. Selection of the appropriate study depends upon a number of factors, including: clinician judgment; hospital resources; and patient age, size, and comorbidities (eg, degenerative osteoarthritis), which may affect whether adequate plain radiographs can be obtained.
