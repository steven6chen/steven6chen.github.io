This topic will briefly review our understanding of the function of the CaSR in the parathyroid glands and kidneys and then describe conditions caused by mutations in this gene, particularly FHH and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58108\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58108 \">table 1</a>). There is also increasing evidence that abnormalities of the CaSR can be an acquired defect in hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONS OF THE CALCIUM-SENSING RECEPTOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is expressed in multiple tissues, including the parathyroid glands, kidneys, bone marrow, osteoclasts and osteoblasts, breast, thyroid C-cells, gastrin-secreting cells in the stomach, intestine, some areas of the brain, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. One of its main functions is to regulate calcium balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/1,2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8</a>]. The CaSR senses small changes in the serum ionized calcium concentration. In response to these changes, the CaSR brings about changes in the function of parathyroid glands and kidneys, which are directed at normalizing serum calcium concentration. This receptor is also activated by magnesium and by certain amino acids and therefore may have a role in the cellular response to changes in other constituents of the extracellular environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Parathyroid gland</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CaSR is highly expressed on the surface of the chief cells of the parathyroid glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It permits the parathyroid gland to sense variations in the serum calcium concentration, leading to the desired changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. A fall in serum calcium concentration is a potent stimulus to the release of PTH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63814\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63814 \">figure 1</a>). This is an appropriate physiologic response since, via its effects to increase bone resorption, to increase the formation of calcitriol in the kidney and to reduce renal calcium excretion, PTH acts to raise the serum calcium concentration toward normal. Chronic hypocalcemia, acting via the CaSR, has other homeostatically appropriate effects on parathyroid function, including increasing PTH gene expression and stimulating parathyroid cellular proliferation. Conversely, when serum calcium concentration is high, synthesis and secretion of PTH are inhibited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action#H2506925384\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid hormone secretion and action&quot;, section on 'Biological actions of PTH'</a>.)</p><p>There are clearly PTH-independent roles for the CaSR in maintaining the normally exquisitely tight regulation of serum calcium concentration. Mice lacking both the PTH and CaSR genes develop marked hypercalcemia in response to oral calcium loads, while those lacking only PTH can mount an effective defense against hypercalcemia via the CaSR by upregulating renal calcium excretion and calcitonin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, polymorphisms of the CaSR may underlie some of the variability observed in the serum calcium concentrations in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Urine calcium excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CaSR is an important regulator of urinary calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. It explains why hypercalcemia reduces calcium and sodium transport in the loop of Henle, with an associated decrease in urinary concentrating ability. Receptors expressed on the basolateral membrane on the cells of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle appear to be the major site where this occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/8,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20,21</a>].</p><p>A brief review of normal function in this segment is required to understand the mechanism by which the CaSR acts. Filtered sodium chloride enters the cells in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle via Na-K-2Cl cotransporters in the luminal (or apical) membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75301 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although this process is electrically neutral, most of the potassium reabsorbed by the cotransporter leaks back into the lumen to drive further inward sodium chloride transport. This movement of cationic potassium into the lumen plus the movement of reabsorbed chloride (via a chloride channel) out of the basolateral surface of the cells generates a net transepithelial potential difference. That is, the tubular lumen is positive with respect to the interstitial fluid and capillaries at the basolateral cell surface. The resulting lumen electropositivity drives the passive reabsorption of cations (sodium and, to a lesser degree, calcium and magnesium) via the paracellular pathway between the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>When calcium intake is increased, some of the excess calcium is absorbed, enters the systemic circulation, and slightly raises the serum calcium concentration. Suppression of PTH release with subsequent reduction in distal tubular calcium reabsorption increases calcium excretion. This appropriate change may be augmented by direct effects of hypercalcemia on the CaSR in the ascending limb of Henle's loop, which include the following sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium binding to the receptor leads to the generation of an arachidonic acid metabolite (which may be 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [20-HETE] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]) that then inhibits the potassium channel in the luminal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in the basolateral membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of potassium recycling via the potassium channel reduces sodium chloride reabsorption via the Na-K-2Cl transporter, diminishing the generation of the lumen-positive electrical gradient and therefore passive reabsorption of calcium and magnesium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of the sodium pump reduces the driving force for sodium and chloride entry from the tubular fluid by the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An additional action of the CaSR reduces cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, thereby diminishing the increase in lumen positive potential that is stimulated by PTH through activation of adenylate cyclase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another action of the CaSR is to reduce the permeability of the paracellular pathway for reabsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> that is created by claudins 16 and 19 between the tubular epithelial cells of the thick ascending limb by upregulating the inhibitory claudin 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is increasing evidence that calcium-induced activation of the CaSR impairs concentrating ability. Two sites appear to be involved: first, interference with sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb directly impairs generation of the medullary osmotic gradient that is essential for urinary concentration; second, activation of calcium-sensing receptors expressed on the luminal membrane of the cells of the inner medullary collecting duct reduces antidiuretic hormone-induced increases in water permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Acutely, the CaSR-mediated reduction in concentrating ability allows calcium excretion to increase while minimizing the risk of crystallization of calcium salts and the resultant possibility of stone formation owing to dilution of the calcium in a larger volume of urine. Chronically, it may be responsible for the nephrogenic diabetes insipidus associated with chronic hypercalcemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>). This action of the CaSR on urinary concentrating ability may be augmented by CaSR-mediated activation of proton secretion in the intercalated cells of the outer medullary collecting duct, which further increases the solubility of calcium salts, particularly the calcium-phosphate in mouse models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CaSR is expressed in chondrocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclast precursors, and some osteoclasts.

An inactivating (or loss-of-function) mutation shifts the calcium-PTH curve to the right and produces hypercalcemia since higher concentrations of calcium are required to suppress PTH release, in effect &quot;resetting&quot; the serum calcium concentration to a higher than normal level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63814\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63814 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Inactivating mutations of the CaSR gene have been reported in inherited hypercalcemic disorders, eg, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH; also called familial benign hypercalcemia) and neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. The degree of hypercalcemia in these two disorders reflects a gene dose effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. FHH heterozygotes usually have mild hypercalcemia because of partial loss of CaSR function. In contrast, most patients who are homozygous for the CaSR gene defect have more marked disease, presenting with NSHPT and serum calcium concentrations in rare cases in excess of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/34,35,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35,37,38</a>]. In unusual cases, however, the mutation produces only mild inactivation of the receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], resulting in moderate hypercalcemia in homozygotes that is more similar to that in FHH, while heterozygotes can be normocalcemic, resulting in an autosomal recessive clinical presentation of hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>These differences have been confirmed in mice lacking the CaSR gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Heterozygotes have a syndrome similar to FHH, while homozygotes have the murine equivalent of NSHPT. The number of CaSR molecules on the surface of the parathyroid glands may be a major determinant of the serum calcium concentration in normal subjects. However, some mutations exert a dominant negative action, thereby producing hypercalcemia in heterozygotes that is higher than is typically seen in FHH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FHH is a benign cause of hypercalcemia that is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance.

In most cases, FHH results from inactivating mutations in the CaSR, whose gene resides on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q21.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]; this form of FHH is now called FHH1. In addition, a few families have been described in whom their conditions are linked to either the short arm (19p13.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] or the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The form of FHH (FHH2) arising from the short arm of chromosome 19 results from inactivating mutations in G alpha 11, one of the guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins linking the CaSR to activation of phospholipase C, which contributes to inhibition of PTH release at elevation of extracellular calcium concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The form of FHH (FHH3) that is linked to the long arm of chromosome 19 results from missense mutations of adaptor-related protein complex 2, sigma 1 subunit (AP2S1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], which participates in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors and signal transduction. Mutations in AP2S1 decrease the sensitivity of the CaSR-expressing cells to extracellular calcium and modify the receptor's endocytosis.</p><p>Several hundred different mutations of the CaSR have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (A summary of CaSR mutations is maintained at the calcium-sensing receptor database [CASRdb] at McGill University [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].) Most result in receptors that have a change in a single amino acid (missense mutation) that reduces the receptor's function or, less commonly, that produce a truncated, inactive CaSR; in both cases, the result is fewer normally functioning receptors on the parathyroid or renal cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/35,38,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38,45</a>].</p><p>The inactivating mutations of the CaSR in FHH make the parathyroid glands less sensitive to calcium. This defect means that a higher than normal serum calcium concentration is required to reduce PTH release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/42,45,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45,51</a>]. In the kidney, this defect leads to an increase in tubular calcium and magnesium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43</a>]. The net effect is hypercalcemia, hypocalciuria, and frequently high normal levels of serum magnesium or frank hypermagnesemia. Thus, the relative insensitivity of the CaSR to calcium effectively &quot;resets&quot; not only parathyroid but also kidney to maintain mild to moderate hypercalcemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In FHH, serum PTH concentrations are typically inappropriately normal or high (in approximately 20 percent of cases) in the presence of mild hypercalcemia.

The usual lack of high serum PTH concentrations may contribute to the benign clinical course of FHH, as compared with primary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/39,43,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43,53</a>].

As an example, in some families with what was thought by experienced clinicians to be familial isolated hyperparathyroidism or sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism, inactivating mutations of the CaSR have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. In these patients, the clinical presentation is similar to that of primary hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria). Furthermore, in one family with an atypical presentation of FHH (including hypercalciuria and even renal stone disease), which was confirmed by mutational analysis to be due to an inactivating mutation in the CaSR, subtotal parathyroidectomy was effective in reversing the biochemical abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Some of these cases may harbor mutations in regulatory regions of the gene affecting its level of expression.</p><p>Genetic testing by mutational analysis is also available for the two more recently discovered forms of FHH, FHH2 and FHH3. FHH3 appears to comprise 20 to 25 percent of patients diagnosed as having FHH on clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biochemical grounds, while FHH2 comprises less than 10 percent of such patients. In FHH3, most mutations reside in codon 15 of <em>APS2S1, </em>simplifying the initial genetic screening for this form of FHH. Given the relative frequency of FHH (FHH1 and FHH3 more common than FHH2), it has been suggested that sequencing of the <em>CaSR</em> and <em>AP2S1</em> genes (perhaps only codon 15 of the latter) should be performed first and sequencing of <em>GNA11</em> only carried out if the other two genes are unrevealing for pathogenic mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. There is no firm consensus, however, in this regard, and the discovery of additional cases of FHH2 and FHH3 will be useful in refining the diagnostic approach to the three forms of FHH (and perhaps others yet to be identified).</p><p>In most circumstances, the diagnosis of FHH, particularly its distinction from primary hyperparathyroidism, is primarily based upon the absence of symptoms, as well as laboratory findings typical of FHH in the proband (PTH-dependent, hypocalciuric hypercalcemia). A history of familial hypercalcemia with hypocalciuria, sometimes with previously unsuccessful parathyroid surgery, in other affected family members, including young children, is helpful in diagnosing FHH. Even if the family history is negative, this does not rule out familial involvement in this typically asymptomatic condition, and serum and urinary calcium determination should be performed in several first-degree relatives, if possible. Penetrance is high and typical findings in the proband, combined with family screening that yields biochemical findings characteristic of FHH, is often the most reliable method of confirming the diagnosis. In most cases, however, mutational analysis is being carried out and provides the definitive diagnosis assuming the mutation, if identified, is pathogenic and not simply a polymorphism.</p><p>The laboratory findings that help to distinguish FHH from primary hyperparathyroidism are also discussed in more detail elsewhere.

In patients with ADH, serum PTH concentrations are low or inappropriately normal despite the presence of mild to moderate and occasionally severe hypocalcemia.

In addition to the lack of need for therapy in asymptomatic patients, there is a high potential for adverse effects from raising the serum calcium with vitamin D supplementation.
