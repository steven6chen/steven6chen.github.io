Reperfusion following fasciotomy causes local and systemic effects that can be life-threatening and can complicate wound management.</p><p>The management of the patient following extremity fasciotomy, including management of reperfusion, wound care, and methods and timing of fasciotomy wound closure, will be reviewed here. Preoperative management and the indications, diagnosis, and techniques used to perform fasciotomy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity fasciotomy techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443283570\"><span class=\"h1\">ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local and systemic consequences of ischemia-reperfusion occur after fasciotomy. Increased blood flow in the muscle following restoration of normal tissue pressure usually causes muscle edema. The extent of extremity swelling depends upon the duration and severity of ischemia, the predominant muscle cell type within a muscle, the location and mass of ischemic muscle, and the status of the venous circulation. </p><p>Animal studies show that cellular damage starts approximately three hours after a complete ischemic insult and is nearly complete by six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In humans, the level of tolerance to an ischemic insult varies and not all ischemic insults are complete. Patients with underlying peripheral artery disease may exhibit less than expected swelling due to the protective effects of pre-existing arterial collaterals that lessen the severity of ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There is also evidence from animal studies that ischemic preconditioning in skeletal muscle may mitigate the severity of muscle injury, remote organ injury, and mortality after major ischemic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>Swelling may be limited if there is incomplete reperfusion due to microvascular thrombosis. With prolonged ischemia, a &quot;no reflow phenomenon&quot; occurs that is characterized by capillary occlusion from endothelial swelling, plugging of capillaries with red and white blood cells, and increased interstitial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Reperfusion may occur at the macrovascular level, but there is no tissue perfusion. Clinically, this manifests as myonecrosis with minimal extremity swelling. </p><p>Successful reperfusion liberates the byproducts of muscle ischemia and cell necrosis (rhabdomyolysis) into the circulation, including potassium, phosphate, organic acids, myoglobin, creatine kinase, and thromboplastin. The systemic effects of these byproducts may include hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, and myoglobinuria, which can cause acute kidney injury, elevation of serum creatine kinase levels, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. (See <a href=\"#H443284400\" class=\"local\">'Management of reperfusion'</a> below.). </p><p>Muscles differ in their susceptibility to ischemic injury based upon the predominant muscle fiber type that is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Type I fibers rely primarily on oxidative metabolism of triglycerides, making these fibers vulnerable to ischemia. In comparison, type II fibers use anaerobic metabolism of glycogen and, as a result, these fibers tolerate ischemia to a greater degree. Differences in muscle fiber distribution may explain, in part, the higher incidence of compartment syndrome in the anterior compartment of the leg, compared with the superficial posterior compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 1</a>). The tibialis anterior muscle is comprised primarily of type I fibers, whereas the gastrocnemius muscle has primarily type II fibers. </p><p>Although fasciotomy leading to reperfusion is generally limb-saving, crush injuries involving large muscle groups (eg, buttock, thigh) may be prone to life-threatening complications from reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The magnitude of the reperfusion insult may be so severe that sudden cardiac arrest can occur as a consequence of hyperkalemia with or without severe metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques#H428236833\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity fasciotomy techniques&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a> and <a href=\"#H443284400\" class=\"local\">'Management of reperfusion'</a> below.)</p><p>Interruption of venous outflow due to venous obstruction or surgical ligation after trauma may aggravate swelling. In the injured extremity, venous repair of major veins of the leg, such as the femoral or popliteal vein, is performed whenever feasible to prevent increased venous pressure that can lead to prolonged muscle swelling and compartment syndrome. When the venous injury cannot be repaired, prophylactic fasciotomy is frequently performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques#H443285312\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity fasciotomy techniques&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic fasciotomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443284400\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF REPERFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of reperfusion injury is focused on restoration of intravascular volume, followed by prevention and treatment of associated metabolic abnormalities. The most serious abnormalities include hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury due to myoglobinuria.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperkalemia &ndash; Hyperkalemia is treated to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. Treatment is initiated based upon the presence of peaked T waves on the electrocardiogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80441\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80441 \">waveform 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Cardiac manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Peaked T waves in this setting are an indication for <strong>urgent</strong> therapy of hyperkalemia, since ongoing release of potassium from ischemic or necrotic muscle cells can lead to progressive and life-threatening hyperkalemia. Treatment of hyperkalemia in this setting may include multiple modalities, with intravenous calcium having the most rapid onset. In the absence of electrocardiographic changes, hyperkalemia can initially be managed by ensuring adequate urinary output, but careful monitoring of the serum potassium is warranted. The manifestations and treatment of hyperkalemia are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic acidosis<strong> </strong>&ndash; Metabolic acidosis, usually lactic acidosis during reperfusion, may exacerbate hyperkalemia and induce hypotension. The initial management of lactic acidosis is focused on volume resuscitation to restore tissue perfusion, with a goal of achieving a urine output of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour. Severe acidosis with an arterial pH below 7.10 to 7.15 may be treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>. Issues related to the treatment of lactic acidosis are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicarbonate-therapy-in-lactic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicarbonate therapy in lactic acidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;, section on 'Overview of therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria &ndash; Rhabdomyolysis presents with elevated serum muscle enzymes (including creatine kinase), red to brown urine due to myoglobinuria if there is persistent renal function, and electrolyte abnormalities. Peak serum creatine kinase levels depend upon the volume of muscle breakdown and the muscle mass of the patient. Creatinine kinase values should be measured twice daily until decreasing levels are observed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Aggressive saline hydration is the primary initial therapy of myoglobinuria, lowering the risk of induction of acute kidney injury. Other treatments may include bicarbonate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>. The prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443284358\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A late consequence of muscle ischemia is capillary occlusion. Some authors have recommended high dose anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> as a means of limiting progressive small vessel occlusion. Because many inflammatory mediators are generated by the activation of clotting, heparin may serve a dual purpose limiting coagulation and the associated inflammation and swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>However, the risk of anticoagulation after fasciotomy may outweigh the theoretical benefits for many patients and there are no convincing data to support its routine use in this setting. Anticoagulation is warranted for acute ischemia and compartment syndrome due to thromboembolism. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443283577\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although fasciotomy is mandated by the diagnosis of an acute compartment syndrome, the wounds created from the fasciotomy procedure are associated with significant morbidity. The goals of wound management include identifying and debriding nonviable muscle and avoiding further muscle injury from wound dessication. We suggest leaving fasciotomy wounds open rather than closure or graft coverage of the skin in the immediate postoperative period to facilitate assessment of tissue viability. Premature wound closure before adequate resolution of swelling can lead to recurrent compartment syndrome. Nonviable tissue within the wound may lead to other wound complications such as infection. (See <a href=\"#H443283633\" class=\"local\">'Wound complications'</a> below.)</p><p>In the first 24 to 48 hours after fasciotomy, we prefer sterile saline gauze dressings that allow frequent wound assessment. Thereafter, we use negative pressure wound therapy until muscle swelling has regressed. (See <a href=\"#H443283584\" class=\"local\">'Skin closure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H398898525\" class=\"local\">'Negative pressure wound therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>While awaiting skin closure or grafting, a variety of methods can be used to limit skin retraction and promote apposition of the dermal edges prior to negative pressure wound therapy, or for patients who are not candidates for negative pressure wound therapy. Among the simpler, less costly approaches are placement at the time of the fasciotomy of cutaneous sutures, or silastic vessel loops anchored to staples on the skin edges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71739\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71739 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Commercially available devices for this purpose include the Sure-Close suturing system, Marburger Skin Approximation System, Wisebands device, and Canica device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. A small trial compared negative pressure wound therapy with wound approximation using the shoelace technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Time to wound closure was significantly longer in the negative pressure wound therapy group (19.1 versus 15.1 days), with 6 of 42 patients requiring skin grafts compared with 0 of 40 in the shoelace group. Negative pressure wound therapy was also more costly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H398898525\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative pressure wound therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Negative pressure wound therapy, also called vacuum-assisted wound closure, refers to wound dressing systems that continuously or intermittently apply subatmospheric pressure to the surface of a wound. Negative pressure wound therapy decreases tissue edema, enhances local blood flow, promotes granulation tissue, and decreases bacterial colonization. The general mechanism of action of negative pressure wound therapy and the placement and management of the negative pressure wound therapy device are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although there are no randomized trials comparing negative pressure wound therapy with standard gauze dressings for fasciotomy closure, retrospective studies show a decrease in the time to skin closure or grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The larger of these studies compared 458 wounds treated with negative pressure wound therapy to 270 treated with standard gauze dressings. A significantly higher rate of skin closure (83 versus 56 percent) and decreased time to skin closure (5.2 versus 6.5 days) were found for negative pressure wound therapy compared with gauze dressings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81875569\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperbaric oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal studies and case reports describe hyperbaric oxygen as adjunct treatment for the management of wounds following fasciotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. Further research is needed to determine the appropriate role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443283584\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the viability of the muscle is confirmed and muscle swelling has regressed, skin closure becomes the primary focus. Skin closure is usually achieved by bringing the edges together, skin grafting, or less commonly, a myocutaneous flap. In an occasional patient, the wounds may be left to heal by secondary intention. Appropriate timing of the closure is important to avoid recurrent compartment syndrome that can occur by closing the skin prematurely. </p><p>Delayed skin closure is appealing because it offers definitive closure soon after fasciotomy. However, delayed skin closure is often not feasible due to residual swelling. One study found that delayed skin closure less than five days postoperatively produced an undesirable increase in intra-compartment pressures (&gt;30 mmHg) in 7 of 12 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The authors suggest that measuring intra-compartment pressures during delayed skin closure might avoid this complication. Skin closure between 8 and 14 days postoperatively may decrease the incidence of wound complications and decrease the length of stay compared with later closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>More extensive fasciotomy wounds, particularly open wounds associated with massive post-fasciotomy muscle swelling, could require several weeks to achieve closure. These wounds are candidates for closure with a skin graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. Myocutaneous flap coverage is a rare adjunct that may be needed if neurovascular structures or vascular grafts are exposed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443283619\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The complications related to fasciotomy are multifactorial. Most complications are related to the underlying condition or injury that indicated the need for compartment decompression. The acute compartment syndrome may cause further injury, and the lack of timely diagnosis and treatment of acute compartment syndrome can be catastrophic. The fasciotomy can be an additional source of morbidity. </p><p>Technical complications related to fasciotomy technique are largely preventable. Persistent or recurrent compartment syndrome can occur if fascial incisions are not adequate to permit complete decompression of the compartment or if selective fasciotomy has been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques#H548658803\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity fasciotomy techniques&quot;, section on 'Technical complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11098771\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent neurologic deficits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent neurologic deficits are the most common complication of the treatment of extremity compartment syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Following lower extremity fasciotomy, impaired neurologic function of some type is evident in 7 to 36 percent of limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Nerve injury is due to soft tissue trauma, nerve ischemia during the interval of increased compartment pressure, or as a consequence of the fasciotomy incisions or dissection. Nerve injury as a technical complication during fasciotomy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques#H16956529\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity fasciotomy techniques&quot;, section on 'Neurovascular injury'</a>.)</p><p>The most common neuropathic symptom is altered sensation at the margins of the incision, which was documented in 77 percent of patients in a retrospective review of 60 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Chronic pain syndromes developed in 10 of these patients (17 percent) at a mean follow-up of 59 months.

Early wound complications occur in up to 40 percent of patients following lower extremity fasciotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/30,35,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35,39</a>]. Risk factors for wound complications include the presence of vascular injury, greater than an eight-hour time interval between the injury and fasciotomy, a lower extremity site, and prophylactic fasciotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Prophylactic antibiotics should be given at the time of the fasciotomy procedure and discontinued within 24 hours. Wound infection is treated, as indicated by positive wound cultures with antibiotics based upon sensitivity testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques#H16956492\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity fasciotomy techniques&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p>During fasciotomy, muscle devascularization may result from soft tissue debridement or during the fasciotomy procedure.

In a series of 36 patients undergoing lower extremity fasciotomy for a variety of indications, multivariate analysis identified age &gt;50 years as a significant predictor of poor outcome (death, amputation or extremity dysfunction) following fasciotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Older patients were more likely to have undergone fasciotomy as a result of a vascular procedure. Trauma patients were younger and had better overall outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/36,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,43</a>].</p><p>The mortality rate following upper extremity fasciotomy appears to be lower at approximately 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a retrospective review of 139 patients with traumatic brachial artery injury, there was no difference in mortality rate for patients who required fasciotomy compared with those who did not (3.4 versus 2.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443284217\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle reperfusion following extremity fasciotomy can lead to potentially life-threatening systemic complications and profound tissue swelling that complicates wound management. (See <a href=\"#H443283570\" class=\"local\">'Ischemia-reperfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of the systemic complications of reperfusion injury is focused on restoration of intravascular volume, followed by prevention and treatment of associated metabolic abnormalities including hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and myoglobinuria, which may lead to acute kidney injury. (See <a href=\"#H443284400\" class=\"local\">'Management of reperfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> closing the skin wounds for at least four days following fasciotomy to permit assessment of the severity of swelling and viability of the muscle (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Premature closure before adequate resolution of swelling can lead to recurrent compartment syndrome. The presence of nonviable tissue within the wound may lead to other wound complications such as chronic wound drainage or infection. We prefer saline gauze dressings in the immediate postoperative period to facilitate frequent wound evaluation and interval debridement of necrotic tissue, as needed. Once the fasciotomy wounds are stable, they can be managed with gauze dressings or negative pressure wound therapy. Negative pressure wound therapy has the advantage of decreasing edema and may lead to earlier fasciotomy closure. (See <a href=\"#H443283577\" class=\"local\">'Wound management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound closure is typically accomplished with delayed skin closure, skin grafting, and, although rarely needed, sometimes myocutaneous flap coverage. The decision to perform delayed skin closure over skin grafting depends upon several factors, and no one closure technique is appropriate for all patients. In an occasional patient, the wounds may be left to heal by secondary intention. (See <a href=\"#H443283584\" class=\"local\">'Skin closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent neurologic deficits following fasciotomy for acute compartment syndrome are common. Nerve injury can be due to soft tissue injury from the inciting traumatic event, nerve ischemia during the interval of decreased compartment perfusion, or as a consequence of the fasciotomy incisions, dissection or muscle debridement. (See <a href=\"#H11098771\" class=\"local\">'Persistent neurologic deficits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound complications are common, occurring in up to 40 percent of patients following lower extremity fasciotomy. Risk factors for wound complications include the presence of vascular injury, a greater than eight hour time interval between the injury and fasciotomy, a lower extremity site, prophylactic fasciotomy and premature fasciotomy wound closure. (See <a href=\"#H443283633\" class=\"local\">'Wound complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lindsay TF, Liauw S, Romaschin AD, Walker PM.
