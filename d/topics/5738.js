Lipid disorders are clinically silent in the vast majority of cases, and selective screening alone (ie, screening only children with a positive family history) fails to identify a substantial number of children with lipid disorders.

The evidence supporting the potential benefits of screening and treatment in children comes from short-term trials in high-risk populations and studies demonstrating links between pediatric dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H435122678\" class=\"local\">'Association with atherosclerosis and CVD'</a> below.)</p><p>Nevertheless, after review of the available literature, the 2011 United States National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) expert panel established <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/peds_guidelines_sum.pdf&amp;token=U1alekcv4Iw7waTPXIrPoANC6KlwUiRFjv33M16hMwcnYjl+uVwSQKUpQdETV/H4biTPzAi2hzcp3vjsG4+T/g==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16972\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guidelines</a> that recommend screening all children for dyslipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-definition-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These guidelines combine the two complementary approaches of universal screening before and after onset of puberty and selective screening at other ages.

If the initial fasting profile is abnormal, a second FLP should be obtained two weeks to three months after the initial screen, and the results should be averaged to guide clinical decision making. In the subset of patients who are unable to comply with the required fasting, it is reasonable to perform the initial screen using a nonfasting profile (ie, non-HDL-C testing). Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES, 1999 to 2008) demonstrate only small differences between nonfasting and fasting lipid measurements that are likely clinically insignificant. Decisions about pharmacologic therapy should be made based on testing performed while fasting.

TG levels are influenced by recent food intake and should be measured in the fasting state when possible. In contrast, differences in measurements of TC and HDL-C between the fasting or nonfasting state are small and clinically insignificant.

In patients with more pronounced hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C levels must be measured directly (direct LDL). However, we do <strong>not</strong> routinely use direct LDL as a screening test because of systematic errors in these assays compared with fasting lipid profiles and because normative values are based on the calculated LDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dyslipidemia-in-children-definition-screening-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,42</a>].
