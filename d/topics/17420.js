This results in drainage of all pulmonary venous return into the systemic venous circulation.</p><p>The anatomic variants, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of TAPVC will be reviewed here. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of TAPVC ranges from 0.6 to 1.2 per 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Among newborns with congenital heart disease, the incidence of TAPVC ranges between 0.7 and 1.5 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal development, the lung buds are formed from the primitive foregut and share a common vascular plexus (splanchnic plexus), which initially drains into the common cardinal and umbilicovitelline venous systems. With the formation of the lungs (27 to 29 days of gestation), a portion of the splanchnic plexus differentiates into the primitive pulmonary vascular bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. During this same time period, the primitive left atrium forms a primordial evagination (common pulmonary vein) that grows into and joins the pulmonary portion of the splanchnic plexus. Once the connection is made, the primitive pulmonary venous system separates from the cardinal and umbilicovitelline veins. Portions of the common pulmonary vein are subsequently incorporated into the wall of the left atrium and become the two right and two left pulmonary veins, each of which enters the left atrium through a separate orifice.</p><p>TAPVC arises from the failure of the left atrium to link with the pulmonary venous plexus, which results in the retention of connections through the primitive cardinal and umbilicovitelline drainage pathways. The anatomic variants of TAPVC are dependent upon which specific connections are retained. The cardinal venous system provides connections to the innominate vein, right atrium, superior vena cava, or azygous vein, and the umbilicovitelline system to the portal or hepatic vein, or inferior vena cava.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC VARIANTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TAPVC can be divided into four anatomic forms depending upon the anomalous connections to the systemic veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77375 \">figure 1</a>). Three are defined by the location relative to the heart: supracardiac, cardiac, and infracardiac TAPVC. In these three categories, it is assumed that all pulmonary veins drain at the same horizontal level. In the fourth type, mixed TAPVC, pulmonary venous connections enter at two or more different levels relative to the heart.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supracardiac &minus; Supracardiac TAPVC results from retained pulmonary vein connections to the cardinal venous systems. In affected patients, the pulmonary veins from both lungs course to a confluent chamber that is located just posterior to the left atrium. From this chamber, blood ascends through a vertically oriented vein that most often connects to the left innominate vein. Other locations for supracardiac TAPVC connections include the right-sided superior vena cava, azygous vein, or a persistent left superior vena cava, which would drain to the right atrium via the coronary sinus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac &minus; Cardiac TAPVC results from retained pulmonary vein connections to the cardinal venous systems. In affected patients, the pulmonary veins course directly toward the heart, but instead of the normal linkage within the left atrium, the pulmonary veins connect to the posterior aspect of the coronary sinus or to the right atrium itself (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76860\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76860 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infracardiac &minus; Infracardiac TAPVC results from retained pulmonary vein connections to the umbilicovitelline venous system. In affected patients, the pulmonary veins drain into a common vertical vein that courses inferiorly from the mediastinum, through the diaphragm via the esophageal hiatus, and inserts most often into the portal vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other insertions include the hepatic vein, ductus venosus, or inferior vena cava either above or below the level of the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed &minus; Mixed TAPVC refers to any combination of connections that enter at two or more different levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65581\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef65581 \">movie 2</a>). The most common arrangement of mixed TAPVC is that of three pulmonary veins joining to form a single confluence and a fourth vein draining via a separate venous connection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>In a series of 1693 patients from the multicenter Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium, the relative frequencies of these four variants were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supracardiac &ndash; 46 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac &ndash; 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infracardiac &ndash; 23 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed &ndash; 11 percent</p><p/><p>A similar distribution of these anatomic variants was reported in two other smaller series.

In supracardiac and infracardiac TAPVC, mixing of the blood occurs where the pulmonary veins join the systemic veins before the return to the heart. In cardiac TAPVC, the mixing occurs either within or just adjacent to the right atrium.</p><p>The mixed, partially oxygenated blood is then shunted right-to-left at the atrial level (or infrequently through a patent ductus arteriosus) into the systemic circulation, resulting in cyanosis.</p><p>Because the right atrium is receiving blood from both the pulmonary and systemic venous systems, both the right atrium and ventricle become dilated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstructed forms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In obstructed forms of TAPVC, there is compression of the pulmonary venous system by surrounding structures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supracardiac &minus; Obstruction may occur where the vertical vein courses between the left pulmonary artery and left mainstem bronchus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infracardiac &minus; Obstruction usually occurs in cases of infracardiac TAPVC. Constriction of the vertical vein commonly occurs at the level of the diaphragm, within the liver in cases where the connection involves the ductus venous, or by the liver parenchyma when the connection is with the portal vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac &minus; In some cases of cardiac TAPVC, obstructed flow may be due to stenosis at the mouth of the coronary sinus where the pulmonary veins connect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &minus; Other sources of obstruction include stenotic, tortuous, or atretic pulmonary and common vertical veins, or a restrictive atrial septum.</p><p/><p>If blood flow is significantly obstructed, pulmonary venous pressure is elevated, and this increase is transmitted back to the lung vasculature, resulting in progressive interstitial and alveolar edema. These changes in turn lead to increased pulmonary resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. In some cases, pulmonary artery pressure can be significantly elevated or exceed systemic pressure, resulting in right ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, and right heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Unobstructed forms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In unobstructed forms of TAPVC, there is no significant stenosis or compression of the pulmonary veins or the venous confluence. Unobstructed forms generally have a net left-to-right shunt due to the relatively low resistance in the lungs. The pulmonary bed thus receives a disproportionate amount of stroke volume from the heart leading to pulmonary overcirculation. Due to the high amount of pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary artery pressures in the unobstructed forms are usually elevated, though not as severely as the obstructed forms. If uncorrected, this will lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular changes that may result in right ventricular failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-left-to-right-shunts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of left-to-right shunts&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4235174176\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations vary and are dependent upon the presence and degree of pulmonary venous obstruction. In general, the more severe the obstruction, the earlier and more severe the presentation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obstructed TAPVC</strong> &ndash; Patients with severe obstruction generally present as critically ill newborns with cyanosis and with symptoms of respiratory failure and shock. These patients have elevated pulmonary artery pressure and edema resulting in respiratory distress, tachypnea, and diminished systemic output resulting in hypotension. In the newborn, obstructed TAPVC may be difficult to distinguish from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS); however, the timing of the onset of symptoms can help differentiate between these two disorders. Signs of RDS begin immediately after birth, whereas the presentation of TAPVC is slightly delayed, with onset of symptoms typically appearing after the first 12 hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unobstructed TAPVC</strong> &ndash; Patients with unobstructed lesions may only have subtle cyanosis immediately after birth, which may be detected by a pulse oximetry screening. Although hypoxia is invariably present in TAPVC, the range varies, and some patients may not appear to be cyanotic. In one series of 75 patients with TAPVC, two were found to be acyanotic with SaO<sub>2</sub> of 88 and 92 percent during cardiac catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After the immediate newborn period, symptoms are related to pulmonary overcirculation, including tachypnea, poor feeding, and failure to thrive. Over time, these patients develop right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular changes that may result in right ventricular failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinical findings in unobstructed TAPVC are similar to other disorders with large left-to-right shunts, such as a large ventricular or atrial septal defect.

There is an increased incidence in heterotaxy patients diagnosed with asplenia or right atrial isomerism.</p><p>TAPVC is a common finding in patients who have heterotaxy with asplenia or polysplenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In these patients, it is presumed that disruption of both cardiac and abdominal viscera early in embryology result in the characteristic congenital anomalies of this syndrome.

TAPVC is one of three diagnoses that should be suspected in patients who present with cyanotic heart disease and respiratory symptoms due to pulmonary overcirculation. The other two are transposition of the great arteries and truncus arteriosus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-causes-of-cyanosis-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac causes of cyanosis in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography is the most frequently used technique to diagnose the underlying cause of cyanotic congenital heart disease, especially TAPVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of TAPVC is made based upon a composite of findings that includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to demonstrate the normal pulmonary venous connections to the left atrium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstration of a common ascending collecting vein along with a dilated superior vena cava and innominate vein (because of increased blood flow) in patients with supracardiac lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstration of a common descending collecting vein with a connection to either the hepatic or portal vein, and a dilated inferior vena cava (because of increased blood flow) in patients with infracardiac lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstration of a direct connection between the pulmonary venous system and the right atrium or coronary sinus in patients with cardiac TAPVC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76860\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76860 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all forms of TAPVC, the right atrium and ventricle will be dilated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right-to-left interatrial shunting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doppler imaging can also estimate pulmonary artery pressures, and measure the blood flow rates through the ascending or descending vertical veins</p><p/><p>The diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography was illustrated in a case series that reported 22 of 23 patients with TAPVC were accurately diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The sites of connection of the individual pulmonary veins were identified in all but one patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although cardiac catheterization has been the gold standard for diagnosis of TAPVC, it is generally no longer needed to make the diagnosis because of the availability of other diagnostic modalities (ie, echocardiography, computed tomographic angiography [CTA], and magnetic resonance angiography [MRA]) that are less costly and invasive, and provide adequate imaging for diagnosis. CTA and MRA are typically reserved for cases when the initial echocardiogram could not completely resolve the anatomy or was unable to identify the individual pulmonary veins and vertical veins. Cardiac catheterization may be indicated if more hemodynamic information is required or in some patients who may require palliative interventional procedures, such as atrial septostomy to improve interatrial blood flow in those with a restrictive atrial septum. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>Both CTA and MRA can evaluate pulmonary pathways and connections in great detail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. CTA better visualizes lung parenchyma and airways; however, it requires exposure to ionizing radiation while MRA does not. MRA has the disadvantages of requiring more time to image. Infants and young children often need sedation for this modality. Both CTA and MRA require intravenous (IV) contrast for optimal visualization of the vasculature. In patients with renal failure or insufficiency, certain vessels can be visualized without IV contrast, but image quality may vary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on chest radiography are nonspecific and cannot be used to make a diagnosis of TAPVC. They also vary depending upon the presence and severity of obstruction.</p><p>In patients with unobstructed TAPVC, lung parenchyma may be normal except for mild prominence of the pulmonary arteries. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The classic snowman sign is present in young children with supracardiac TAPVC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50639\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50639 \">image 1</a>) but is usually masked by the thymic shadow in neonates.</p><p>In patients with obstructed TAPVC, the cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Pulmonary vein congestion and interstitial edema may be present, and in many cases, pulmonary artery dilation is also present. In severe obstruction, the combination of vascular congestion and pulmonary edema leads to a ground glass appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103884\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef103884 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on electrocardiography are both insensitive and nonspecific and cannot be used to make a diagnosis of TAPVC. They include evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, in neonates, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate true right ventricular hypertrophy from the physiologic increase in right-sided voltage normally seen during the newborn period. Tall P waves indicating right atrial enlargement may be commonly seen in patients greater than one month of age.

The specific surgical procedure varies depending upon the anatomy of the TAPVC lesion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In supra- and infracardiac TAPVC with a common vertical vein, a normal pulmonary venous pathway is created by opening and forming an anastomosis between the pulmonary venous confluence and the left atrium.

Three-year survival was significantly lower in patients with postoperative PVO compared with the overall cohort (59 versus 85 percent).

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Embryology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TAPVC can be divided into the four anatomic variants depending upon the anomalous connections to the systemic veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77375 \">figure 1</a>). Three are defined by the location of their connection relative to the heart (ie, supracardiac, infracardiac, and cardiac TAPVC), and in the fourth, pulmonary venous return enters at two or more different levels of the heart (mixed TAPVC). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic variants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In TAPVC, the entire oxygenated pulmonary venous return mixes with the systemic venous system. A portion of this mixed, partially oxygenated blood is then shunted right-to-left at the atrial level (or infrequently through a patent ductus arteriosus) into the systemic arterial circulation causing cyanosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical presentation varies and is dependent upon the presence and degree of pulmonary venous obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H4235174176\" class=\"local\">'Presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with severe obstruction generally present as critically ill newborn infants with cyanosis, respiratory distress, and signs of shock.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Those with unobstructed lesions may only have subtle cyanosis immediately after birth, which may be detected by a pulse oximetry screening. After the immediate newborn period, symptoms are related to pulmonary overcirculation, including tachypnea, poor feeding, and failure to thrive. Over time, these patients develop right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular changes that may result in right ventricular failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of TAPVC is usually made by cardiac echocardiography. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all patients with TAPVC undergo surgical correction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Based on natural history data, mortality without surgery is as high as 80 percent; whereas in contemporary case series, mortality following surgical correction is approximately 15 percent. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients require reintervention. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial medical management focuses on stabilizing patients prior to surgical correction (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Initial medical management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with <strong>obstructed </strong>TAPVC, this includes the use of supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, administration of inotropic drugs, and in some cases, prostaglandin therapy. If initial medical management does not adequately stabilize the patient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and palliative cardiac catheterization procedures have been used to stabilize severely affected patients prior to surgical correction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with <strong>unobstructed</strong> TAPVC, diuretic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> at a total oral dose of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day divided in two doses) may be warranted if there are signs of pulmonary overcirculation (eg, tachypnea, respiratory distress, poor feeding).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After surgical repair, follow-up care should be individualized. In general, physical activity is not restricted and endocarditis prophylaxis is not indicated beyond six months after the surgery. Other important aspects of follow-up care include developmental screening and monitoring for arrhythmias.
