Diuretics are well tolerated in patients with renal sodium retention but, if underfilling is the primary mechanism, can lead to worsening hypovolemia as evidenced clinically by an elevation in serum creatinine.

The interstitial oncotic pressure is derived primarily from filtered plasma proteins and to a lesser degree proteoglycans in the interstitium. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Application to nephrotic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At first glance, a reduction in plasma oncotic pressure induced by hypoalbuminemia would seem to favor the movement of fluid out of the vascular space into the interstitium and produce arterial underfilling. However, it is the <strong>transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient</strong> (plasma minus interstitium), not the plasma oncotic pressure alone, that acts to hold fluid within the vascular space. The normal interstitial oncotic pressure in humans is 10 to 15 mmHg (compared with about 26 mmHg in the plasma) due in part to accumulation of some of the small amount of albumin that is filtered across the capillary wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p>This distinction is important since the gradual fall in plasma oncotic pressure in the nephrotic syndrome is associated with a <strong>parallel decline</strong> in interstitial oncotic pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74352\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74352 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], which minimizes the change in the transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient and therefore minimizes fluid movement out of the vascular space and results in relative maintenance of the plasma volume. The following factors contribute to this protective response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoalbuminemia is associated with less albumin entry into the interstitium</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fluid that moves from the vascular space into the interstitium will lower the interstitial albumin concentration by dilution </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is increased lymphatic flow, which, by bulk flow, will remove albumin as well </p><p/><p>As a result, there is usually little change in the transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient in patients with nephrotic syndrome and therefore little tendency to plasma volume depletion, unless the hypoalbuminemia is severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Similarly, the plasma volume is typically preserved after diuretic therapy for edema removal in patients with nephrotic syndrome as long as the patient is not overdiuresed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The response is appreciably different after the rapid administration of large volumes of saline to patients with marked hypovolemia due to bleeding (eg, ruptured aortic aneurysm). In this setting, there is an <strong>acute</strong> dilutional reduction in the plasma albumin concentration without time for the interstitial albumin concentration to fall. As a result, the transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient is reduced and peripheral edema due to fluid movement out of the vascular space can occur before the restoration of normal intracardiac filling pressures.</p><p>It is important to appreciate that the absence of demonstrable plasma volume depletion when a nephrotic patient is edematous does not preclude an important role for underfilling. Initial underfilling can activate compensatory mechanisms (such as enhanced renin release) that then return the plasma volume toward normal at the price of extracellular volume expansion and edema. Such a sequence clearly occurs in heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Furthermore, patients with the nephrotic syndrome do not have the clear signs of volume expansion (and occasionally pulmonary edema) as can be seen with renal sodium retention due to acute glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence supporting underfilling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following findings support an important role for hypoalbuminemia and underfilling in the pathogenesis of edema in some patients with the nephrotic syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients, primarily those with minimal change disease, have low rates of sodium excretion and elevated plasma renin activity, findings suggestive of volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/6,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,12</a>] (see <a href=\"#H613074727\" class=\"local\">'Volume regulatory hormones'</a> below). One study, for example, evaluated 30 children with early relapse of minimal change disease who were studied within a <strong>few days</strong> of the onset of relapse as indicated by persistent 3+ findings on the urine dipstick for protein; 21 had edema at the time of evaluation and were evaluated for symptoms or signs of hypovolemia which included tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction (eg, cold hands and feet), and oliguria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compared with the eight asymptomatic patients, the 13 patients with hypovolemic signs or symptoms had a higher plasma renin activity, higher plasma aldosterone and norepinephrine concentrations, and more sodium avidity as evidenced by a lower fractional excretion of sodium. The differences between the two groups could not be explained by differences in proteinuria or the degree of hypoproteinemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal serum total protein concentration is 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L),</span> a little more than one-half of which (3.5 to 5.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [35 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L])</span> is normally comprised of albumin. The findings in the preceding study of children with early relapse of minimal change disease are consistent with dog studies in which severe reductions in the total protein concentration (mean 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [24 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L],</span> normal 7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [72 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L])</span> produced by plasmapheresis plus isotonic fluid replacement led to significant reductions in plasma volume and blood pressure and increases in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Support for this hypothesis comes from a study of 22 children with nephrotic syndrome not due to minimal change disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Sixteen children had stable edema <strong>without</strong> marked sodium retention or changes in volume regulatory hormones; these patients had a mean plasma albumin concentration of 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (21 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>. In contrast, six had clinical (tachycardia, vasoconstriction, pallor, oliguria) and hormonal evidence of hypovolemia; these patients, four of whom had congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, had a mean plasma albumin concentration of 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>.

However, this response is not seen in all patients and is not predictably seen in the same patient studied on several occasions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence supporting primary renal sodium retention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in experimental animals with unilateral nephrotic syndrome or glomerulonephritis suggest that primary sodium retention in these disorders is due to increased sodium reabsorption in the collecting tubules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82649\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82649 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], which is also the site of action of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and the related renal hormone urodilatin. This has been called the overfill hypothesis since primary renal sodium retention leads to volume expansion, as opposed to underfilling as discussed in the preceding section, </p><p>Several different abnormalities in tubular function have been identified in the nephrotic syndrome, which could increase sodium reabsorption:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is increased activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump in the cortical collecting tubule but not other nephron segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This pump provides the energy for active sodium transport by pumping reabsorbed sodium out of the cell into the peritubular capillary. However, it is not clear if this represents a primary effect or is simply a secondary marker for increased sodium transport at this site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both experimental and human studies have documented relative resistance to atrial natriuretic peptide and urodilatin in the nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/1,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21-23</a>]. This defect is due at least in part to increased phosphodiesterase activity in the collecting tubules, leading to more rapid degradation of the second messenger of ANP, cyclic GMP (guanosine monophosphate). Infusion of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor largely reverses this defect and restores the normal natriuretic response to volume expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The mechanism by which phosphodiesterase activity is increased in the nephrotic syndrome is not known but phosphodiesterase-mediated resistance to ANP has also been described in heart failure and cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) may contribute to sodium retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Serine proteases (plasmin in particular) in nephrotic urine may activate ENaC via proteolytic cleavage of the gamma chain, providing a potential mechanism by which filtered proteins cause sodium retention. It also explains the observation that remission from the nephrotic syndrome is generally preceded by a decrease in urinary protein excretion. </p><p/><p>Another possible contributor to renal sodium retention is enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption via increased activity of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE3) that mediates a large part of proximal sodium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, even if proximal sodium reabsorption were increased, it might not contribute to sodium retention, since, as mentioned above in the unilateral nephrotic syndrome model, delivery to the end-distal tubule appears to be the same in nephrotic and non-nephrotic kidneys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82649\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82649 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H613074727\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume regulatory hormones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The plasma levels of volume regulatory hormones have been measured in nephrotic patients in an attempt to more clearly define the volume status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Normal subjects ingesting and excreting 20 meq of sodium per day have a high plasma renin activity (PRA) and low atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels. In comparison, most nephrotic patients (at the same low level of sodium excretion) have renin and ANP levels that are equivalent to those in normal subjects ingesting 120 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/day</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50596\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50596 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>These findings suggest at least a component of primary renal sodium retention since sodium excretion is much lower than expected from the plasma hormone levels. However, nephrotic patients with edema do not have the hormonal profile (very low PRA, very high ANP) seen in acute glomerulonephritis, which is thought to represent an example of pure volume expansion due to renal sodium retention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50596\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50596 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Another finding that might favor of a component of underfilling in the nephrotic syndrome is the frequent presence of nonosmotic release of antidiuretic hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, this change is not of major physiologic importance since, in the absence of renal failure, nephrotic patients do not usually develop the water retention and hyponatremia seen in patients with heart failure and cirrhosis, conditions in which decreased effective circulating volume provides the stimulus for hormonal activation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia in patients with heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Response to glucocorticoids in minimal change disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observations in patients with minimal change disease have suggested a relatively minor role for hypoalbuminemia (unless severe) in the development of nephrotic edema in many patients. When remission is induced by glucocorticoids, the peak diuresis typically occurs <strong>before</strong> there is a substantial rise in the plasma oncotic pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55827\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55827 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It is possible, however, that even a small elevation in the plasma albumin concentration is sufficient to reverse underfilling and permit a diuresis. Thus, these observations do not necessarily exclude a pathogenetic role for underfilling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Varying mechanisms in childhood minimal change disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study in children with minimal change disease sheds some light on the often conflicting findings noted above since it suggests that patients with the same disease may have different mechanisms of edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thirty children with minimal change disease in remission were monitored carefully and studied within a <strong>few days</strong> of the onset of relapse as indicated by persistent 3+ findings on the urine dipstick for protein. When first evaluated, three different groups were noted: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nine appeared to have <strong>primary renal sodium retention</strong>.

In addition to edema, overt nephrotic syndrome, and a mean plasma albumin concentration of 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (16 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L),</span> they also had one or more symptoms suggestive of volume depletion (tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, oliguria), marked elevations in the plasma renin activity and plasma concentrations of aldosterone and norepinephrine, low plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide, and a low glomerular filtration rate. In one child, the symptoms and neurohumoral activation were transiently improved by albumin infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eight had edema, overt nephrotic syndrome, and a mean plasma albumin concentration of 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (18 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L),</span> but no signs of hypovolemia.</p><p/><p>The factors responsible for the differences between the last two groups with the same degree of hypoalbuminemia are not well understood. One possibility is that patients with rapid protein loss may have a reduction in the transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient because there has not been sufficient time for the interstitial oncotic pressure to fall. If this were the case, then underfilling should be transient, disappearing as the interstitial oncotic pressure fell in parallel to the change in the plasma oncotic pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoalbuminemia in other edematous disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observations in conditions other than the nephrotic syndrome have been used to evaluate the role of hypoalbuminemia and presumed underfilling in the pathogenesis of edema.

Several factors are thought to play an important role in this relative diuretic resistance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All the commonly used diuretics are highly protein-bound. This limits the diuretic to the vascular space, thereby maximizing its rate of delivery to the kidney. The degree of protein-binding is reduced with hypoalbuminemia, resulting in a larger extravascular space of distribution and a slower rate of delivery to the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of the diuretic that enters the tubular lumen is bound to filtered albumin and rendered inactive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In experimental in vivo microperfusion of the loop of Henle, the addition of albumin to the perfusate in a concentration similar to that seen in the tubular lumen in the nephrotic syndrome diminishes the response to intraluminal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> by about 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

In one study of seven patients with nephrotic syndrome, blocking of albumin binding to furosemide by the administration of sulfisoxazole had no effect on the diuretic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies in rats with drug-induced nephrotic syndrome suggest that the loop of Henle may be relatively resistant to loop diuretics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>The net effect is that the effective diuretic dose is usually higher in patients with nephrotic syndrome compared with other edematous disorders. As an example, the maximum dose of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> is 40 to 80 mg in edematous patients with heart failure or cirrhosis who have a relatively normal glomerular filtration rate, but may be as high as 80 to 120 mg in patients with the nephrotic syndrome and a relatively normal glomerular filtration rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

There are two mechanisms responsible for the development of edema in patients with the nephrotic syndrome: low plasma levels of albumin which promotes the movement of fluid out of the vascular, leading to underfilling of the vasculature and secondary sodium retention; and primary sodium retention induced by the renal disease. It is likely that both can contribute to a variable degree in individual patients. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Underfilling versus renal sodium retention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although an important role of arterial underfilling appears to be predicted from Starling's law, the gradual fall in plasma oncotic pressure in the nephrotic syndrome is associated with a parallel decline in interstitial oncotic pressure, which minimizes the change in the transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient. This minimizes fluid movement out of the vascular space, resulting in many patients in relative maintenance of the plasma volume. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Starling's law'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, underfilling does occur, particularly in children with minimal change disease of acute onset or severe hypoalbuminemia (often below 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L])</span>. Such patients may have symptoms or signs of hypovolemia, including tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction (eg, cold hands and feet), and oliguria. In addition, patients with symptomatic hypovolemia, compared with asymptomatic patients, have a higher plasma renin activity, higher plasma aldosterone and norepinephrine concentrations, and more sodium avidity as evidenced by a lower fractional excretion of sodium. In the absence of symptoms or signs, the major manifestation of underfilling is an otherwise unexplained elevation in serum creatinine with diuretic therapy in patients who still have edema. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Evidence supporting underfilling'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of primary renal sodium retention as a cause for nephrotic edema is supported by both experimental models and observations in nephrotic patients. Experimental models suggest that the sodium retention is due to increased sodium reabsorption in the collecting tubules. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evidence supporting primary renal sodium retention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies in children with minimal change disease have shown that either underfilling or primary renal sodium retention can be the mechanism for edema. In adults, the majority of patients present with primary sodium retention.

Excess fluid can usually be removed without inducing clinically significant plasma volume depletion. The effective diuretic dose is usually higher in patients with nephrotic syndrome compared with other edematous disorders and the addition of a thiazide diuretic or, alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamterene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamterene</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, may be required in patients with refractory edema. In nephrotic children with clinical signs of reduced effective arterial blood volume or a low fractional excretion of sodium (ie, less than 0.2 percent), the addition of albumin may be considered.

Minimal change disease is a major exception to this approach since remission can usually be induced with glucocorticoid therapy. A possible additional benefit of angiotensin inhibition in diuretic-resistant patients is a decrease in the severity of albuminuria, which might increase the plasma albumin concentration and enhance the response to diuretics.
