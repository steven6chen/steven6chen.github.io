Approximately 5 percent of the general population is affected by symptoms related to hemorrhoidal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The cardinal features of hemorrhoidal disease include bleeding, anal pruritus, prolapse, difficulty with hygiene, and pain due to thrombosis. Although these symptoms may strongly suggest the diagnosis, confirmation by flexible sigmoidoscopy, anoscopy, or colonoscopy should be performed in most patients who present with bleeding, especially those deemed at higher risk for malignancy or additional symptoms (ie, weight loss, changes in bowel habits).</p><p>This topic will review common surgical techniques used to treat hemorrhoids. The anatomy and clinical features of hemorrhoids, and nonsurgical treatment options, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home and office treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103488979\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach to treating most patients with hemorrhoids is conservative. Patients who fail medical management may be candidates for a nonsurgical office-based procedure prior to requiring surgical treatment. Ongoing symptoms in spite of conservative or office-based treatment usually require surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids#H813383083\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home and office treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids&quot;, section on 'Conservative treatment for all patients'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical excision of hemorrhoids remains a very effective approach for treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids but is reserved for selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A formal hemorrhoidectomy in appropriately selected patients can resolve the patient's symptoms and minimizes recurrent disease when performed properly. Patients with grade III or IV hemorrhoids, and those with severe external disease, appear to benefit the most from surgery. Patients who are unable to tolerate office-based procedures due to significant comorbidities or taking anticoagulation medication would also benefit from an excisional hemorrhoidectomy. Some patients may prefer surgical treatment sooner rather than later, after a frank discussion of other treatment options and the benefits and risks of surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home and office treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A surgical procedure is generally limited to those with the following clinical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]: </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627671397\"><span class=\"h2\">External hemorrhoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(See <a href=\"#H456751032\" class=\"local\">'External hemorrhoidectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic external hemorrhoids (eg, pain, thrombosis) refractory to conservative measures </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic external hemorrhoids (eg, pain, thrombosis) refractory to office-based procedures, or unable to tolerate office-based procedures because of pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large or severely symptomatic external hemorrhoids (eg, severe pain, interfere with hygiene, severe skin irritation and itching)*</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with substantial external skin tags </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined internal and external hemorrhoids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic external hemorrhoids in the presence of a concomitant anorectal condition that requires surgery</p><p/><p>*It is important to note that for some indications, failed prior treatment is not required prior to proceeding with surgical treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627671410\"><span class=\"h2\">Internal hemorrhoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(See <a href=\"#H456750972\" class=\"local\">'Internal hemorrhoidectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolapsed internal hemorrhoids that can be manually reduced (Grade III), particularly if more than one column is involved*</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolapsed and incarcerated internal hemorrhoids (Grade IV)* (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75759\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75759 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic internal hemorrhoids (eg, pain, thrombosis) refractory to conservative measures </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic internal hemorrhoids (eg, pain, thrombosis) refractory to office-based procedures, or unable to tolerate office-based procedures because of pain*</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined internal and external hemorrhoids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic internal hemorrhoids in the presence of a concomitant anorectal condition that requires surgery</p><p/><p>*It is important to note that for some indications, failed prior treatment is not required prior to proceeding with surgical treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103489031\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preoperative assessment includes a detailed history; physical examination, which includes external inspection of the anus and a digital rectal examination; and anoscopy. Medications, particularly those that increase the risk of bleeding (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), should be reviewed and are preferably held in the perioperative period depending on the indications for treatment and risk of cessation. Consultation with the patient's primary care provider or cardiologist may be warranted. Perioperative management of anticoagulation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Medications affecting hemostasis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient is instructed to undergo a cleansing enema before the procedure. A full mechanical bowel preparation is not indicated and may be counterproductive. </p><p>There is a paucity of data regarding the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. One retrospective study reported that there was no benefit to preoperative use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> compared with no antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The authors agree that antibiotics are not necessary in most clinical settings, as the risk of infection is low. Patients with underlying immunosuppression or extensive cellulitis may benefit from perioperative antibiotics, such as metronidazole or a second-generation cephalosporin. </p><p>Immediately prior to performing the procedure, anoscopy should be repeated in the semi-inverted jackknife or left lateral position. The assessment includes an evaluation for the presence of external hemorrhoids, location, volume, redundancy, and grade of internal hemorrhoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemorrhoids: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627672400\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemorrhoid surgery can be performed using general anesthesia, regional anesthesia (spinal, epidural), perianal block, or straight local anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>]. The choice is often one of surgeon preference, but patient-related factors also play a role. One of the authors uses intravenous sedation and a perianal block for nearly all hemorrhoid surgeries. Occasionally, a regional (spinal) anesthetic or general anesthetic may be needed for selected patients, such as those with respiratory conditions (ie, cannot lay supine or prone, require airway protection). </p><p>The patient is first anesthetized (general, regional, intravenous) and positioned (see <a href=\"#H42920242\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> below) for the procedure. An anal block is performed (see <a href=\"#H42919883\" class=\"local\">'Perianal anesthesia/block'</a> below), and a Hill-Ferguson retractor is placed into the anal canal and rectum to facilitate adequate inspection of the individual internal hemorrhoid columns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42920242\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient positioning is another primarily surgeon-dependent variable. Although many anesthesia providers may be more comfortable with the lithotomy position, the authors prefer prone jackknife positioning for most cases, as it provides an excellent view and exposure of the perianal region for the surgeon as well as for an assistant or trainee. The prone position can be used for patients who need their airway controlled. The patient is typically intubated on the transport stretcher first, then turned prone onto the operating room table. For these patients, it may be prudent to keep the patient's stretcher in the operating room in the event that the patient needs to be quickly returned to the supine position, though this is rarely necessary. For patients unable to tolerate the prone position because of concerns with airway control, the lithotomy or left-lateral positions are acceptable alternatives. However, visualization and access to the base of the hemorrhoid may be more difficult. </p><p>In all cases, care should be made to avoid unnecessary pressure on the male genitalia and to pad all bony prominences, particularly the legs when lithotomy position is used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-injury-associated-with-pelvic-surgery#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve injury associated with pelvic surgery&quot;, section on 'Avoid prolonged lithotomy position'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42919883\"><span class=\"h2\">Perianal anesthesia/block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the frequency of postoperative pain, a perianal block is administered to most patients. In a systematic review that assessed analgesia following hemorrhoidectomy, perianal infiltration of local anesthetic provided significant pain relief, whether given alone or as a supplement to other forms of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. If spinal anesthesia is used, perianal anesthesia is not necessary. In randomized trials, long-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal bupivacaine</a> (eg, Exparel) was associated with a significantly greater decrease in post-hemorrhoidectomy pain compared with traditional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>An anal block is performed by injecting local anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>), typically with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56799 \">table 1</a>), into the ischiorectal fat immediately peripheral to the external sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium bicarbonate</a> (1 cc per 30 cc lidocaine) can be added per provider discretion to help minimize local irritation with injection if the patient remains awake. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456751032\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTERNAL HEMORRHOIDECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>External hemorrhoids generally do not require surgical management. Exceptions may include thrombosed external hemorrhoids or large external hemorrhoids that cause symptoms that cannot be controlled or interfere with hygiene. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-and-office-treatment-of-symptomatic-hemorrhoids#H813383083\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home and office treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids&quot;, section on 'Conservative treatment for all patients'</a> and <a href=\"#H103488979\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456751273\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombosed external hemorrhoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a thrombosed external hemorrhoid present with an acutely painful purplish or blue mass in the perianal area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78700\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78700 \">picture 2</a>). Some surgeons advocate excision of the thrombosed external hemorrhoids to prevent recurrent thrombosis. For those patients who present in persistent pain (typically within 72 hours from the onset), excision of the thrombosed external hemorrhoid provides immediate relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Conservative management only is recommended when the patient presents with diminishing symptoms (typically later than this 72-hour timeframe) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After 48 to 72 hours, the thrombus organizes and contracts, lessening symptoms and obviating the need for surgical management. Occasionally, a thrombosed hemorrhoid will evacuate spontaneously, leaving a small ulcer with residual clot at the anal opening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72916 \">picture 3</a>). This will typically resolve on its own over a few weeks, although the patient may be left with a skin tag that rarely causes enough symptoms to warrant its removal. However, in those patients that have a large enough skin tag that causes skin irritation, itching, pain, or inability to keep proper hygiene, excision can be beneficial. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456751373\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When indicated, external thrombosed hemorrhoids are best treated with hemorrhoid excision, rather than incision and simple evacuation of the clot, an approach that should generally be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, if timely evaluation by a surgeon is not available and the provider is not comfortable with excision of the thrombosed hemorrhoid, incision of the hemorrhoid can be performed to remove the clot, which should lessen symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H456752769\" class=\"local\">'Excision'</a> below and <a href=\"#H456752781\" class=\"local\">'Incision'</a> below.)</p><p>The recurrence rate for a completely excised thrombosed hemorrhoid is 5 to 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. By comparison, simple incision and evacuation of the clot is associated with a 30 percent risk of reaccumulation and thrombosis, which may disseminate to adjacent hemorrhoidal columns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456752769\"><span class=\"h3\">Excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excision of external hemorrhoids (thrombosed or symptomatic) can be performed in the operating room, emergency room, or an appropriately equipped office. </p><p>The skin overlying the hemorrhoid is prepped with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> solution, and local anesthesia is infiltrated into the skin at the base and overlying the area of excision around the hemorrhoid. A supplemental anal block, in addition to this infiltration can also be performed, and is preferred by the authors. (See <a href=\"#H42919883\" class=\"local\">'Perianal anesthesia/block'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excision of a thrombosed hemorrhoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67857 \">figure 1</a>) is performed by making an elliptical incision in the skin overlying the hemorrhoid. The thrombosis and the resultant edematous tissue create a readily identifiable plane for dissection. The incision is carried around the hemorrhoid and dissected with care from the superficial fibers of the anal sphincter, making certain to avoid injury. Patients with extensive thrombosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60155\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60155 \">picture 4</a>) have a higher risk of injury if the perianal skin and anoderm are aggressively resected. The excision can be performed with a scalpel, scissors, or electrocautery pen, depending on the preference of the surgeon. The skin edges can be left open and allowed to drain or reapproximated with absorbable sutures, also depending upon surgeon preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A topical antibiotic ointment can be applied to the wound; however, this is not necessary, as infection is rare in this well-vascularized site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excision of a nonthrombosed hemorrhoid is performed in the same manner, simply making an elliptical incision around the skin and hemorrhoidal tissue (in the absence of a clot). </p><p/><p>Following excision of an external hemorrhoid, the anal area is covered by a dressing to protect the clothing from soilage. (See <a href=\"#H456750246\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care and follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456752781\"><span class=\"h3\">Incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For nonsurgeons who do not feel comfortable excising the overlying skin of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid, an alternative is to simply incise the overlying skin. Evacuation of thrombus from the hemorrhoid can produce immediate relief of pain. However, clot evacuation is less likely to be beneficial if the patient is seen after 48 hours following the onset of pain. When hemorrhoid incision, rather than excision, is used, there can be residual clot if the incision is too small, and reaccumulation of blood and thrombosis can occur. Thus, follow-up within the next 24 to 48 hours for surgical evaluation is generally advised. (See <a href=\"#H456751373\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456750972\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERNAL HEMORRHOIDECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemorrhoidectomy techniques differ predominantly based upon how the hemorrhoidal tissue is removed and whether or not the rectal mucosa is closed. Conventional hemorrhoidectomy excises the hemorrhoidal tissue with a scalpel, monopolar electrocautery, or other advanced electrosurgical devices (eg, Ligasure, Harmonic scalpel). Alternative methods of hemorrhoidectomy, such as stapling and hemorrhoidal artery ligation, have also been performed.

(See <a href=\"#H627674294\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> below.)</p><p>Closed hemorrhoidectomy, or a modification of the technique, is the more commonly performed procedure for internal hemorrhoidectomy. This technique is successful in 95 percent of cases and has a low rate of wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Open hemorrhoidectomy is preferred for acute gangrenous hemorrhoids where tissue edema and necrosis prevent closure of the mucosa without undue tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In most other clinical settings, the handling of the mucosal wound is left to the discretion of the surgeon, though the authors prefer a closed approach. In general, there appears to be no definitive advantage between open or closed hemorrhoidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. When performing hemorrhoidectomy, all three hemorrhoidal columns are usually treated simultaneously. For those less experienced in performing a three-column hemorrhoidectomy or in patients with concern that this would result in anal stenosis, one- or two-column hemorrhoidectomy may be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>One study compared open hemorrhoidectomy to a modified closed approach (&quot;semi-open&quot;) in 300 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The semi-open technique was associated with more rapid healing and a lower incidence of postoperative complications. In another trial, 40 patients undergoing open and 40 patients undergoing closed hemorrhoidectomy were compared, the pain score at the first bowel movement was significantly lower for the closed group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As might be expected, wound healing was significantly faster for the closed group (75 versus 18 percent at three weeks postoperatively). Nevertheless, in the absence of high-quality evidence, it remains up to the discretion of the surgeon as to which of these techniques is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627674508\"><span class=\"h3\">Conventional versus stapled</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional hemorrhoidectomy can be used to treat both internal and external hemorrhoids. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy does not address external hemorrhoids. Thus, in patients with external or combined internal and external hemorrhoids, conventional hemorrhoidectomy is preferred.</p><p>Both conventional hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy are most commonly used to treat symptomatic prolapsing (grade II, III, and IV) internal hemorrhoids.

Stapled hemorrhoidopexy resulted in less pain than conventional hemorrhoidectomy in the initial six weeks postsurgery. At 12 and 24 months, however, patients treated with stapled hemorrhoidopexy reported worse incontinence, tenesmus, and hemorrhoid symptoms; more hemorrhoid recurrences; and worse quality of life compared with those treated with conventional hemorrhoidectomy. </p><p>Earlier trials and systematic reviews agreed that stapled hemorrhoidopexy was less painful but that conventional surgery resulted in better symptom relief and fewer recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. Additionally, postprocedural tenesmus and reoperations were more prevalent among patients who underwent stapled hemorrhoidopexy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Considering the evidence, we suggest choosing a hemorrhoidectomy procedure based on the patient's values and preferences. Overall, conventional hemorrhoidectomy appears to offer better and more durable outcomes than stapled hemorrhoidopexy. For patients who prefer to minimize pain and &quot;downtime&quot; after surgery, however, stapled hemorrhoidopexy remains a viable option. </p><p>Although more commonly reported for stapled hemorrhoidopexy because it is newer than conventional hemorrhoidectomy, serious complications can occur with both procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In the eTHoS trial cited above, serious adverse events, such as rectal bleeding, anal stenosis, and urinary retention, occurred in 9 and 7 percent of patients undergoing conventional and stapled hemorrhoid surgery, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electrosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electrosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The goals of hemorrhoid resection are to remove the redundant tissue, avoid damage to the sphincter, and avoid taking too much anoderm, which might lead to anal stenosis. For conventional hemorrhoidectomy, the junction of the internal and external component of the hemorrhoid is grasped with a small clamp (eg, Allis, Babcock) to retract the hemorrhoid away from the sphincter muscles. Using a scalpel or electrocautery pen, the rectal mucosa is scored in an elliptical or diamond shape around the hemorrhoidal bundle to delineate the plane for excision of the hemorrhoid. The incision is carried deeper starting distally on the external hemorrhoidal tissue and extending proximally across the dentate line to the superiormost extent of the hemorrhoidal column. The hemorrhoid tissue is carefully dissected from the superficial internal and external sphincter muscles toward the main vascular pedicle in the anal canal. Care must be taken not to narrow the anal canal when multiple hemorrhoidal excisions are performed. Only the redundant anoderm associated with the hemorrhoidal tissue should be removed, preserving a minimum of 1 cm of anoderm between columns. </p><p>The base of the pedicle is suture ligated, and the hemorrhoidal tissue is removed. The mucosal defect is then left open to heal by secondary intention, or closed with a continuous 2-0 or 3-0 absorbable suture (eg, Vicryl). To minimize the chance of narrowing the anal canal, a Hill-Ferguson retractor should be left in place until all suturing is complete. (See <a href=\"#H627674072\" class=\"local\">'Open versus closed hemorrhoidectomy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438683868\"><span class=\"h3\">Stapled</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is an alternative to conventional internal hemorrhoidectomy. This procedure does not effectively treat most external hemorrhoids. The need for a specialized device makes this procedure more expensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. The technique uses a circular stapling device to excise a circumferential column of mucosa and submucosa from the upper anal canal, which reduces the hemorrhoidal tissue back into the anal canal and fixates them into position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The device also interrupts part of the hemorrhoidal blood supply, thereby decreasing vascularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H627674294\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above.) </p><p>An anal dilator or obturator is provided with the surgical stapler and provides gentle dilatation of the anal canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101078 \">figure 2</a>). The circular stapling device is introduced into the anus, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">mucosa/submucosa</span> contents are brought into the stapler. Before the stapler is engaged or fired, the posterior wall of the vagina should be assessed to ensure the stapler has not inadvertently engaged it. This can be noted by moving the stapler and seeing that the posterior vaginal wall does not tent or move with it. When the stapler is fired, it creates a circular fixation of all tissues within the nonabsorbable circumferential purse string suture to the rectal wall. In effect, it will draw up and suspend the prolapsed internal hemorrhoid tissue. The staple line should be fully evaluated as this is a potential source for early bleeding and may require a suture ligation. The most critical component of the procedure is the placement of the purse-string suture in the <span class=\"nowrap\">mucosa/submucosa</span> approximately 4 cm from the dentate line. It is important that the purse-string suture be placed far enough proximal to avoid involving the sphincter muscles within the stapling device, and to minimize other complications (eg, changes in continence, stricture, fistula).</p><p>One role for stapled hemorrhoidopexy devices is to treat patients with bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolapsing grade II to IV internal hemorrhoids who have failed rubber band ligation. Another role may be for patients seeking a less painful alternative to conventional surgery, but the patient must be willing to accept a higher risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H627674508\" class=\"local\">'Conventional versus stapled'</a> above.)</p><p>Occasional but important complications have been reported, including persistent postdefecation pain, which affects a small percentage of patients. One study suggested that such symptoms may respond rapidly and completely with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Although an option for patients with grade II to IV internal hemorrhoids, the stapled techniques, as stated above, will not address the external hemorrhoid component if present. Thus, in patients with combined internal and external hemorrhoids, the external hemorrhoids are surgically excised, obviating the benefit of using the stapling device. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27811369\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemorrhoidal artery ligation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative to a conventional hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy is Doppler-guided transanal hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL), also known as transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-49</a>]. HAL uses a specially designed proctoscope housing a Doppler transducer to identify each hemorrhoidal arterial blood supply, which is subsequently ligated. </p><p>A meta-analysis identified 28 observational studies involving 2904 patients undergoing Doppler-guided hemorrhoidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Recurrence rates ranged between 3 and 60 percent (pooled mean 17.5 percent), and the rate of postprocedure hemorrhage was 5 percent. A later randomized trial that included 40 patients with grade II or grade III hemorrhoids found that, although fecal soiling was decreased using both treatments, patients treated with HAL had significantly increased fecal soiling after one year compared with open hemorrhoidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Additional trials with longer-term observation are needed to determine the utility of this approach. </p><p>In a randomized trial of 337 patients with symptomatic grade II or III internal hemorrhoids, HAL resulted in fewer recurrences than rubber band ligation at 12 months (30 versus 49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, this difference was almost entirely accounted for by the need for repeat banding, which is a common practice, but was counted as recurrences in this study. Compared with rubber band ligation, HAL was associated with more pain at one and seven days after the procedure, more serious adverse events requiring hospitalization (7 versus 1 percent), and higher cost (&pound;1750 versus &pound;723). </p><p>Thus, HAL is more effective but more painful and costly compared with a <strong>single</strong> rubber band ligation. For patients with symptomatic grade II or III internal hemorrhoids, a <strong>course</strong> of rubber band ligation remains the first-line procedure of choice due to its low morbidity and cost. Patients who fail, refuse, or could not tolerate rubber band ligation should be referred for one of the surgical hemorrhoidectomy procedures.

The initial approach to treating most patients with hemorrhoids is conservative. For patients who fail medical management or cannot tolerate an office-based procedure, surgical excision remains a very effective approach for treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. For some indications, failed prior treatment is not required prior to proceeding with surgical treatment. (See <a href=\"#H96135853\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H103488979\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine perioperative antibiotics are not necessary. A full mechanical bowel preparation is also not necessary, but patients are usually given an enema just prior to the procedure. Medications that increase the risk of perioperative bleeding (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) should be reviewed and are preferably held in the perioperative period depending on the indications for treatment and risk of cessation. Consultation with the patient's primary care provider or cardiologist may be warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Medications affecting hemostasis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient positioning is primarily determined by the surgeon. The authors prefer prone-jackknife positioning for most cases. For patients unable to tolerate the prone position because of concerns with airway control, the lithotomy or left-lateral positions are acceptable alternatives. However, visualization and access to the base of the hemorrhoid may be more difficult. Care should be made to avoid pressure points. (See <a href=\"#H42920242\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhoid surgery can be performed using general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or straight local anesthesia. The choice is often one of surgeon preference, but patient-related factors also play a role. For all hemorrhoid surgeries (external or internal hemorrhoidectomy, internal hemorrhoidopexy), we infiltrate local anesthetic in the perianal region at the time of hemorrhoidectomy, except in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia. Perianal infiltration of local anesthetic provides significant pain relief, whether given alone or as a supplement to other forms of anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H42919883\" class=\"local\">'Perianal anesthesia/block'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External hemorrhoids generally do not generally require surgical management. When surgery is indicated for thrombosed external hemorrhoids, we suggest hemorrhoid excision rather than simple incision evacuation of the clot (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Simple incision and evacuation of the clot is associated with a high rate of recurrence.

In general, there appears to be no definitive advantage between open or closed hemorrhoidectomy, but closed hemorrhoidectomy (or a modification of the technique) is more commonly performed to treat internal hemorrhoids. All three internal hemorrhoidal columns are usually treated simultaneously. (See <a href=\"#H456750972\" class=\"local\">'Internal hemorrhoidectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is an alternative to conventional internal hemorrhoidectomy. It does not effectively treat external hemorrhoids. Stapled hemorrhoidectomy may have a role in patients with bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolapsing grade II to IV internal hemorrhoids who have failed rubber band ligation or for patients seeking a less painful alternative to conventional surgery but who are willing to accept a higher risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H438683868\" class=\"local\">'Stapled'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An alternative to a conventional hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy is Doppler-guided transanal hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL). HAL is associated with the lowest rate of postoperative complications (including pain) but has the highest recurrence rate. (See <a href=\"#H27811369\" class=\"local\">'Hemorrhoidal artery ligation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following hemorrhoid surgery, the anal area is covered by a dressing to protect the clothing. Pain can be controlled primarily using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and warm Sitz baths. Narcotic medications can be used, if needed, but these may cause constipation. Patients are instructed to avoid constipation. The wounds will generally heal within a couple of weeks. (See <a href=\"#H456750246\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of complications following hemorrhoidectomy is overall low. The main complications following a conventional hemorrhoidectomy technique include urinary retention, urinary tract infection, fecal impaction, and delayed hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H438684236\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-treatment-of-hemorrhoidal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sneider EB, Maykel JA.
