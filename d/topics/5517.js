Approximately 15 to 20 percent of patients have intermittent disease with periods of exacerbation and a relatively good prognosis. However, most patients have progressive disease, with either a slow or a rapid course. The outcome of RA is dependent upon the degree of joint damage, the physical functional status of the patient, psychological health, and the presence of comorbid illness such as cardiovascular disease, infection, and B cell lymphomas. A reduced life expectancy is seen in some patients with severe RA, due to illnesses that may be the result of RA itself or the drugs used in its treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82537 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Functional capacity, comorbidities, and mortality in RA are reviewed here.

Individual joint function depends upon numerous factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity of disease activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural integrity of a joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle strength and tone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General fitness of the patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial factors</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since functional capacity is an important determinant of the natural history of RA and is a useful tool for assessing the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions, many instruments for patient evaluation have been developed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attempts have been made to classify and grade functional capacity based upon the patient's ability to undertake daily activities in the home, at work, or during leisure time. Restriction of physical activity, use of aids and appliances, personal assistance, and level of independence are taken into account in one widely used classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F59908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59908 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional disability indices are also based on self-report questionnaires, which have been validated, such as the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>] and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale Health Status Questionnaire (AIMS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The complexity of these questionnaires and the time required for completion has led to their modification and simplification for use in routine management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Functional disability is predominantly due to inflammatory synovitis during the early stage of the disease, loss of structural integrity of joints at a late stage, and, depending upon the level of disease activity, a combination of both for the rest of the course of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p>Although the HAQ is copyrighted, an <a href=\"https://www.selfmanagementresource.com/docs/pdfs/English_-_Stanford_haq20.pdf&amp;token=cA+FVotxKTVfad3bAso6O6/kdIr5ppN4Ve+mY6Z7ybsb2+IGcRxs7G+yvM+ABz5YyidxUf4XyKCLjisMXrcOLQpQrcklmoFVi88r/cyVNtivALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=7505\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">English-language version and instructions</a> are generally available free of charge, assuming compliance with user permission requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>These questionnaires are limited, however, by their emphasis on the physical impact of RA, rather than the psychological health of the patient or the familial, social, and financial consequences of the disease. Indeed, further studies have suggested that psychosocial factors may contribute between 10 to 20 percent towards disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. All of these important issues contribute to the patient's quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, a holistic approach to managing patients with RA requires careful attention to many potential consequences of this chronic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Disability due to RA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While recognizing the limitations of self-reports of physical function, there is evidence that the common-sense notion that the combination of inflammation and joint damage leads to functional difficulty is correct. This was illustrated by the results of a Finnish population-based survey of 1095 patients with an established diagnosis of RA and 1530 age- and gender-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A score on the HAQ of more than 1 suggests that a person is having difficulty with most activities of daily living. Patients were nearly eight times more likely to report moderate disability (HAQ score &ge;1) than controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term functional outlook is variable for patients who present early in the course of their illness and are treated. As an example, in one study that prospectively followed 168 Swedish patients for 10 years or more, 94 percent continued to be independent in their daily activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The proportions of those with disabilities described as based upon HAQ scores as &ldquo;almost no,&rdquo; mild, moderate, and serious were 20, 28, 48, and 10 percent, respectively, at the end of observation. Almost 20 percent of patients had quiescent disease when last examined.</p><p>Use of effective disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has been increasing, and this may be having a favorable effect on the severity of disability of patients with RA. This was illustrated in a long-term study of successive cohorts of patients with RA that included 3035 patients from eight centers in North America who were followed from 1977 to 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) at enrollment, considered to be an indicator for effective DMARD therapy, increased from 1 to 44 percent, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> use remained relatively constant (31 to 33 percent among the initial and final cohorts, respectively). Average disability as measured by HAQ declined by approximately 2 percent per year. The long-term decline in disability was not explained by other patient characteristics (ie, age, gender, race, level of education, disease duration, or length of follow-up). After adjustment for all recognized confounders, the mean decrease in HAQ disability remained 2 percent per year.</p><p>The beneficial effects of antirheumatic drug treatment on function may be determined, at least in part, by the amount of joint damage that is present at the time such therapy is initiated. This was illustrated in retrospective study data from two trials that had randomly assigned patients with moderate to severe RA, who had not responded fully to MTX, to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]; improvement in function as measured by HAQ was inversely correlated with the amount of baseline radiographic damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These findings suggest that interventions that are effective in preventing joint damage may be most effective in improving function when introduced as early as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact on employment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of RA on the ability to earn a living is uncertain. Early studies suggested that employment of patients with RA was approximately one-half that of unaffected individuals. However, subsequent surveys report similar employment rates among patients with or without RA. As an example, after adjustment for level of education, gender, and age among individuals in the Netherlands, the rates of employment for patients with RA compared with that of the general population were not significantly different (61 versus 65 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The following features related to RA have been noted to increase the likelihood of being unable to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired physical function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty commuting to work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of antirheumatic drug therapy to produce significant improvement (eg, American College of Rheumatology 20 percent response [ACR20]) and Disease Activity Scores (eg, DAS28)</p><p/><p>The presence of other factors is significantly associated with a decreased risk of being disabled, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being self-employed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having ergonomic improvements made at the work site</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reporting a positive attitude about the importance of work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having at least an ACR20 response to antirheumatic therapy</p><p/><p>Employment status (ie, whether a patient is working or not) does not fully capture the economic impact of the disease as it relates to the workplace. The productivity of patients who continue to work may be adversely affected by disease-related absences and work restrictions. An instrument for assessment of work-related limitations, the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ), may be useful for measuring the impact of RA treatments and workplace interventions on productivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COMORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased prevalence of other serious illnesses. As an example, one study of 288 patients with RA found that 54 percent of the respondents reported other chronic conditions; 20 percent rated at least one of these other conditions as severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The predominant conditions contributing to the comorbidity and mortality of RA are infections, renal impairment, lymphomas, and cardiovascular disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82537 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections, particularly pulmonary, skin, and joint infections, occur with increased frequency in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The reason is incompletely understood, but the following factors may contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression by the disease itself or its treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence (often subclinical) of inflammatory lung disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in cigarette smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple factors associated with disability and immobility</p><p/><p>Immunosuppression from corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents is probably the most important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, the highest glucocorticoid doses are used in the patients with most active disease, which also may contribute to the infection risk. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation in a population-based study of 609 RA patients and an equal number of controls that, after adjustment for corticosteroid use, leukopenia, age, cigarette smoking, and diabetes, RA remained an independent risk factor for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The adjusted relative risk (hazard ratio) of infection that required hospitalization was 1.83 for RA patients versus controls (95% CI 1.52-2.21).

This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 27,710 Canadian patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Among patients who were not taking glucocorticoids, the relative risk (RR) of serious infection for DMARD users was not significantly different from that for nonusers (adjusted RR for DMARD users 0.92 [95% CI 0.88-1.0]). All available biologic DMARDs are associated with an increased risk of infections.</p><p>Neutropenia and increased susceptibility to infection are consequences of both Felty's syndrome and the large granular lymphocyte syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-feltys-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Felty's syndrome&quot;</a>).

The lymphoma incidence increases as active RA persists and correlates with the severity of disease activity. As an example, in a retrospective case-controlled analysis of 378 Swedish RA patients with lymphoma and 378 matched RA controls, the risk of lymphoma, expressed as an odds ratio (OR), increased dramatically (OR ninth decile of disease activity, 9.4 [95% CI 3.1-28.0], OR tenth decile 61.6 [95% CI 21.0-181.0]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The most common type of lymphoma was of the diffuse large B cell type (48 percent); 12 percent of lymphomas were positive when tested for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus.</p><p>Drugs used to treat the disease, including alkylating agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha therapy, may contribute to the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], although not all patients with RA who develop malignancies have been treated with any of these drugs. In a case-control study of 23,810 patients with RA, an increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies was associated with the use of immunosuppressive agents; the relative risks were 1.18, 1.44, and 2.21 for MTX, azathioprine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

The ratio of observed to expected deaths (standardized mortality ratio [SMR]) was 1.38 overall, with women bearing the highest risk (SMR of 1.55 and 1.07 for women and men, respectively). Additional data on this almost exclusively white North American population confirmed a modest age- and gender-adjusted increase in SMR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.13-1.41) and no significant change in the risk of premature death during the 40-year period of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Two meta-analyses addressing cardiovascular mortality have largely confirmed these results, with SMRs of around 1.5, suggesting a 50 to 60 percent increased risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. One of these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] showed no change in SMR over a 50-year period. Thus, improvements in therapy have not yet been accompanied by improvements in survival in relation to the general population; moreover, there has been a widening gap between mortality rates in patients with RA and the improving mortality rate in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Furthermore, there is an excess risk of 50 to 60 percent of cardiovascular mortality in patients with RA that has not decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Importantly, these studies also emphasize that assessment of cardiovascular risk should be part of the routine long-term management of patients with RA.</p><p>Mechanisms by which premature mortality can occur in RA include cardiac disease, amyloidosis, transection of the cord due to cervical spine instability, and respiratory failure due to fibrosing alveolitis. Much more common causes of death were related to comorbid illnesses, particularly cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, infection, lymphomas, and gastrointestinal bleeding. With regard to deaths due to acute myocardial infarction, lower rates (comparable with the general population) have been noted in patients with RA diagnosed and treated since 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Patients with RA with a first cardiovascular event appear to have a higher mortality rate during the subsequent 30 days than those without RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The reason for the difference in fatalities (18 versus 11 percent, respectively) is uncertain. Possible explanations include a greater prevalence of severe epicardial coronary artery disease in patients with RA who present with new ischemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] or the presence of small vessel disease that is not amenable to angioplasty or bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Some studies have found a decrease or at least no increase in the expected number of deaths from cancer, probably reflecting the increase from other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, one large study of over 20,000 patients with RA reported an increased incidence of death resulting from lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Patients who respond to therapy, particularly a DMARD, may have lower mortality. As an example, one long-term prospective study of 271 patients begun on MTX found that the group with more than 50 percent improvement had a SMR of 1.47 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]; by comparison, the SMRs of patients who had no improvement or who had discontinued treatment were 4.11 and 5.56, respectively.</p><p>However a beneficial effect of MTX may or may not be confined to those who have a good response. In a cohort study of 1240 patients with RA at one clinical center in North America, 191 patients died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. MTX was prescribed for 588 patients; treatment decisions were not made in a randomized fashion. The group that received MTX had poorer prognostic indicators and more frequent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> use than the MTX-na&iuml;ve group (37 versus 22 percent, respectively). Approximately 70 percent of both groups were women, and the average age was 57 years.</p><p>After adjustment for possible confounding factors including age, sex, marital status, disease duration, body mass index, disability score, blood pressure, presence of absence of diabetes, and use of cholesterol lowering drugs, the hazard ratio for all cause mortality among MTX-treated patients was 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-0.8).</p><p>When deaths were divided into those due to cardiovascular disease and those due to other causes, the hazard ratios were 0.3 and 0.6, respectively. The reduction in cardiovascular mortality risk was statistically significant, while that of non-cardiovascular mortality was not. The patients in this study were treated beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, prior to the general availability of anticytokine therapy. Use of traditional DMARDs other than MTX did not appear to have a similar survival advantage (hazard ratio 1.0).</p><p>Independent predictors of mortality include age, education, male sex, function, rheumatoid factor, nodules, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28 score), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody, joint count, and NSAID and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> use, all markers of clinical severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/34,45,58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,45,58-60</a>]. A lower than ideal body weight (as indicated by a body mass index calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared that is &lt;20) may be associated with increased mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Other factors that may contribute to reduced longevity include the presence of extraarticular disease, depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>], circulating immune complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], increased levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], and the presence of certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1 alleles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72445\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72445 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disease-outcome-and-functional-capacity-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].
