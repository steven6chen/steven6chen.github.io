To obtain images of the pregnant or nonpregnant pelvis, frequencies of 2 to 10 million Hertz (2 to 10 megahertz [MHz]) are typically required.</p><p>Real-time imaging is the most common sonographic technique used in obstetrics and gynecology. Multiple individual B-mode gray-scale images are obtained and rapidly displayed in succession, thereby creating a video of the area of interest over time that can be used to evaluate its structure and some aspects of its function. Real-time ultrasound is especially useful for imaging mobile subjects, such as the fetus or heart, and for quickly viewing an organ from different orientations.</p><p>The scientific principles and safety of ultrasound imaging are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-safety-of-diagnostic-ultrasound-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and safety of diagnostic ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC PROCEDURE AND EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sonography, like surgery, is an operator-dependent technology. A high level of competence can only be achieved by supervised experience with a large variety of normal and abnormal examinations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Preprocedure issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sonographer should know the indication for the ultrasound examination and results of other evaluations related to the patient's problem. All of this information is critical for targeting specific structures, choosing whether to use a transvaginal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transabdominal technique, and deciding whether additional studies may be helpful (eg, saline infusion sonohysterography, Doppler velocimetry).</p><p>In the past, patients were routinely asked to fill their bladders prior to the ultrasound examination. With improvements in ultrasound technology and use of the vaginal probe, this has become unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is little benefit to having a full bladder for obstetrical exams and it is often very uncomfortable for the patient. Furthermore, a full bladder can distort anatomy (eg, false diagnosis of placenta previa or falsely elongated cervix). The cervix can usually be seen transabdominally without a full bladder. If it cannot be adequately seen transabdominally, transvaginal sonography almost always provides satisfactory images. Similarly, if transabdominal visualization of the pregnancy is inadequate in the first trimester, transvaginal sonography will almost always show more detail. In most cases it is optimally performed with an empty bladder; however, when the lower uterine segment or related structures are the area of interest, urine in the bladder can provide a helpful window for the evaluation.</p><p>In gynecologic patients, not allowing the patient to empty whatever urine is in her bladder just prior to a transabdominal ultrasound examination generally permits sufficient initial visualization of the pelvis. Transvaginal sonography is usually performed with an empty bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1752377819\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal obesity limits the technical quality of the ultrasound examination. Imaging may be improved by having the patient lie on her side and placing the transducer at the side of the maternal abdomen rather than in the midline where there is typically greater thickness of abdominal adipose tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by use of transvaginal ultrasound. Although fetal anatomic surveys for malformations are typically performed at 18 to 20 weeks, performing transabdominal examination later in gestation (20 to 22 weeks) in the obese gravida may improve visualization of anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, transvaginal ultrasound of fetal anatomy may be more effective earlier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In obstetrics and gynecology, most exams are performed with the woman in a semi-recumbent position. A padded table and pillows provide reasonable comfort. It is desirable to be able to elevate the head of the bed because many pregnant women are unable to lie flat, especially later in pregnancy. Others will require pillows underneath their knees or behind their back to achieve a comfortable position.</p><p>Transvaginal ultrasound examinations are done with the woman in a lithotomy position. Alternatively, a cushion can be placed under the buttocks to raise the pelvis, while the lower extremities are frog-legged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound waves pass very poorly through air; therefore, coupling gel is necessary. The gel, which is placed on the patient's skin for transabdominal scans and on the covered probe for transvaginal scans, prevents air from coming between the transducer and the patient. The gel also permits the ultrasound probe to gently slide over the abdomen or along the vagina. Warming the gel in a commercial warming device improves patient comfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3342879022\"><span class=\"h2\">Display</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>B-mode imaging, or brightness modulation, is the most common technique for imaging in obstetrics and gynecology. M-mode, or motion modulation, is useful for evaluating the fetal heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Transducers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transducer is located inside the ultrasound probe. During an ultrasound examination, it may be necessary to use multiple transducers (linear array, sector, vector, curved array) to evaluate different structures of interest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Linear array transducers display the image in a rectangular shape, mimicking the long, slender appearance of these transducers. These transducers are optimal for evaluating structures in the near field.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sector scanners display the obtained image in a pie shape with the tip towards the transducer. They are generally rather narrow and small in configuration. As the near field is quite narrow, sector transducers are better at evaluating deeper structures, especially when there are impediments to viewing in the near field, such as ribs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vector transducers are similar to the sector transducers, but have the pie shaped tip removed. This transducer allows more visualization in the near field than the sector scanner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Curved array transducers are a combination of the linear array and vector transducers. These transducers are wide with a narrow curve. They allow a larger near field with a retained large far field.</p><p/><p>The most common transducers used for transabdominal scanning are sector or curvilinear transducers that have frequencies up to 7.0 or 8.0 MHz [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Transducers used for transvaginal scanning typically have frequencies up to 9.0 MHz. It is important to keep in mind that higher frequency transducers provide superior resolution, but have less tissue penetration. This trade-off is important for achieving images of diagnostic quality. Additional information on technical aspects of ultrasound transducers can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-safety-of-diagnostic-ultrasound-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and safety of diagnostic ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology&quot;, section on 'Transducers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3731087979\"><span class=\"h2\">Transabdominal and transvaginal probes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard orientation when performing an ultrasound examination allows a consistent optimal interpretation of the ultrasound findings. The transabdominal ultrasound probe is held in the right hand with the mark (ie, a groove or ridge on one side of the ultrasound transducer) on the thumb side. With this orientation, the right side of the patient is displayed on the left side of the ultrasound imaging screen. The top of the image (the small angled portion) represents structures that are closer to the transabdominal ultrasound transducer, and the bottom of the image (the wide pie shaped perimeter) represents structures further away from the transducer. Because the ultrasound probe can be maneuvered from many different vantage points, the image orientation is only limited by the flexibility of the hand holding the ultrasound probe.</p><p>Transvaginal ultrasound probes differ from transabdominal probes. With a transvaginal probe, the ultrasound beam can project at an angle from the axis of the probe. The mark on the probe represents the left side of the screen. Therefore, if the probe is inserted into the vagina and the mark is held at 12:00, the left side of the image display represents the anterior aspect of the pelvis, and the right side represents the posterior aspect of the pelvis. The top of the image (the small angled portion) represents structures that are closer to the transvaginal ultrasound transducer, and the bottom of the image (the wide pie shaped perimeter) represents pelvic structures further away from the transducer. When the probe is rotated with the mark at 9:00, the orientation is quite different. The inferior and superior portions are unchanged, but the left and right sides of the screen now represent the right and left aspects of the pelvis, respectively. The transvaginal probe can be both rotated and angled to both sides of the pelvis. This maneuvering can be disorienting to inexperienced examiners, yet is essential for a complete examination of the female pelvis.</p><p>It may be more comfortable for the patient if she inserts the transvaginal probe into her vagina herself. A disposable probe cover (eg, male condom) is used to keep the transvaginal probe clean during examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. After each use, transvaginal probes are cleaned and disinfected according to the manufacturer recommendations. The goal of preparing transvaginal ultrasound transducers for patient use is to achieve a high-level of disinfection. This is accomplished by removing the disposable probe cover and using soap and running water to remove any debris. A cloth or similar pad can be used to clean and dry the transvaginal probe. The probe is then disinfected with a high-level disinfectant to provide maximum safety for reuse in the next patient. There are many such disinfectants, including 2.4 to 3.2 percent glutaraldehyde products, such as &quot;Cidex,&quot; &quot;Metricide,&quot; and &quot;Procide,&quot; non-glutaraldehyde products, such as &quot;Cidex OPA&quot; and &quot;Cidex PA,&quot; and 7.5 percent hydrogen peroxide solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Manual settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several parameters require manual adjustment to obtain optimal images because patients differ in body shape and in the area targeted for examination (eg, cul-de-sac, upper abdomen, kidney).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the image field should be adjusted to obtain the best visualization. The area of interest should be enlarged to allow for critical evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The depth of penetration should be adjusted for thorough assessment of the structure of interest and its environment. If set high, a broad anatomic area can be seen, but individual structures will be small, indistinct, and 'far away,' while at low settings, the image will be seen 'close up' and detailed, but surrounding structures will not be visualized. Depending on the area of interest, the depth of penetration will typically be adjusted many times during an ultrasound examination to both obtain a broad view and to hone in on specific structures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The focal zone should be electronically adjusted to enhance visualization of structures at the depth being evaluated. The transmit zone focus should be manually placed at, or just below, the level of the structure of interest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gain should be adjusted to achieve an appropriate level of brightness. Turning the gain up too high will make the image too bright, and turning it down too low will make the image too dark. There is progressive loss of amplitude and intensity of returning sound waves when imaging structures that are at greater distances from the probe. This loss varies with the particular tissue being insonated. Echoes from deeper structures can be amplified or enhanced to improve visualization. Similarly, excessive reverberant echoes can be decreased by turning down the gain, thus raising the threshold for echo detection at a particular level. This is accomplished by using the time-gain-compensation (TGC) knobs, which are adjusted to change the brightness at various levels of the image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Some newer ultrasound machines have an automatically adjusting gain feature. This may be especially helpful for those with less experience, and for those patients who are more difficult to insonate, such as obese women or those with prior abdominal surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue harmonic imaging is an ultrasound technique that enhances visualization of structures that may not have been visualized clearly with standard gray-scale imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Standard two-dimensional gray-scale ultrasound uses a certain fundamental frequency, specific to the transducer. The returning echoes are detected at this frequency. Harmonic frequencies occur as the sound wave moves through tissues and are formed in multiples of the fundamental frequency. The first harmonic, which is twice the fundamental frequency, is used for tissue harmonic imaging. These harmonic frequencies increase with more penetration of the ultrasound beam, and they are at lower amplitude than the fundamental frequency. The inclusion of these harmonic frequencies results in an image with better contrast. Tissue harmonic imaging is especially helpful in obstetrics and gynecology in the obese patient when visualization is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Scanning and documentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's name, medical record number, date of exam, referring clinician, and reason for referral should be documented. It is best to start the examination by getting an overall view of the uterus in an obstetrical ultrasound examination or the pelvis in a gynecologic examination. After this global view, the exam can focus on specific aspects of anatomy. To accomplish this overall view, the depth of penetration should be great enough to allow for a broad view of the uterus and pelvis. Without this global view, important aspects of the examination could be missed (eg, large pedunculated fibroids or large ovarian dermoids).</p><p>Almost all obstetrical and gynecologic sonography is done in real-time, freely moving the probe to view each structure from multiple orientations and then freezing and storing the desired images. Most ultrasound systems can reevaluate the last few seconds of images by scrolling through them as slow as frame-by-frame in a cine loop. Short clips of mobile structures, such as the fetal heart, are also commonly kept as part of the patient's record. Images of both normal and abnormal anatomy, including size measurements where appropriate, should be stored. Biometric measurements are typically performed on the display monitor from a frozen image. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;</a>.) The ultrasound images should be retained as long as clinically useful and consistent with local legal requirements.</p><p>A written ultrasound report should be included in the patient's medical record, and sent to the referring clinician in a timely fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Clinically significant findings should be called to the referring clinician to ensure and facilitate appropriate follow-up. Emergent findings should be called to the referring clinician while the patient is still in the ultrasound facility or en route to the physician's office or hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANCED TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional clinical techniques are used selectively to provide further evaluation of uncertain findings on real time grey scale two dimensional sonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Three-dimensional sonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional sonography refers to a two-dimensional static display of three-dimensional data. Special probes and software are needed to acquire and render the images. Although not a new technique, the indications for its use have not been well-defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The use of three-dimensional technology can reduce scanning time while maintaining adequate visualization of the fetus in obstetrical ultrasound and the pelvis in gynecologic ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Surface rendering of the fetus with three-dimensional sonography can better demonstrate abnormalities previously detected with two-dimensional sonography, especially facial abnormalities and neural tube defects. Fetal central nervous system three-dimensional data sets can be examined remotely to diagnose fetal brain malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In gynecology, the coronal plane of the uterus is easily obtained with three-dimensional but not two-dimensional sonography, thus enhancing visualization of the uterus, especially the uterine cavity. This has improved the capabilities for the sonographic diagnosis of uterine anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Three-dimensional sonography has been used to identify malposition of an intrauterine device (IUD), especially among symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Four-dimensional sonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four-dimensional sonography refers to three-dimensional images that can be viewed in real-time.

By comparison, Doppler ultrasound is used to study blood flow and is particularly helpful in evaluating the functional state of the fetal cardiovascular system, fetoplacental and uteroplacental blood flow, and pelvic tumors. The scientific principles behind Doppler ultrasound and the various techniques (color flow mapping, pulsed wave, continuous wave, pulsed Doppler, tissue Doppler) are reviewed separately.

Obstetrical ultrasound provides information about the pregnancy that is essential for providing optimal prenatal care: accurate determination of gestational age, fetal number, cardiac activity, placental localization, and diagnosis of major fetal anomalies. In the second trimester, fetal anomaly detection rates range from 16 to 44 percent, with detection rates up to 84 percent for lethal anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

It is prudent to document fetal cardiac activity as the initial step, as a diagnosis of fetal demise determines the context for the remainder of the examination. Using real-time scanning, the transabdominal ultrasound probe is maneuvered into different positions to allow visualization of multiple structures, to view a single structure from many different vantage points, and to avoid interference from impediments such as bone and intestinal air. Other maneuvers that may improve the quality of the image include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjusting the frequency of the ultrasound wave: higher frequencies result in lower penetration and improved resolution. Multiple transducers of different frequencies may be necessary during an examination to balance resolution and need for tissue penetration.

The bladder does not have to be full; however, if the pelvis cannot be seen well, it may be necessary to have the patient fill her bladder to a comfortable capacity. This may be especially important for those women who are unable to tolerate placement of a transvaginal ultrasound probe. Often in these cases, the entire examination can be performed transabdominally. If a specific question remains unanswered, or if an abnormality is suspected, other approaches, such as a transrectal examination or even a transperineal examination, may be considered. Other techniques for improving visualization are described above (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Transabdominal examination'</a> above). Transabdominal scanning is important for evaluating the upper pelvis and abdomen, such as with large fibroids, ovarian neoplasms that extend into the upper abdomen, or ovaries lying high in the pelvis. Images only obtained by transvaginal scanning may not be adequate, or may miss pathology, as distance between the area under investigation and the vagina increases.</p><p>After evaluation of the pelvis transabdominally, the patient is asked to void because transvaginal sonography is best performed with an empty bladder. Guiding the probe toward the area of interest, such as an ovary, and watching how this area moves in relation to the other pelvic organs is helpful for evaluation of complicated or unclear pelvic anatomy, especially in the setting of abnormalities. As an example, a pelvic mass (pedunculated fibroid or solid ovarian mass) may lie between the uterus and normal appearing ovarian tissue. On a still image, the uterus, mass, and normal ovary may appear contiguous. With movement of the probe, the specific origin of the mass can usually be determined.</p><p>Visualization of pelvic structures with the transvaginal probe is limited by the relative positions of the pelvic organs and the presence of any pelvic masses. The resolution of high-frequency vaginal probes is good up to a depth of 6 to 8 cm. Transvaginal sonography can be performed concurrently with an abdominal examination to better define normal and abnormal anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As an example, by applying pressure abdominally, the uterus with any associated fibroids, and even the intestines, can be moved away from the ovaries, allowing better visualization.</p><p>Uterine weight correlates with uterine volume, which can be calculated using the prolate ellipsoid method where volume = <span class=\"nowrap\">4/3</span> (pi)(uterine <span class=\"nowrap\">length/2)(anteroposterior</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">diameter/2)(transverse</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">diameter/2)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Uterine measurements are most accurately obtained by transvaginal sonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The mean outer dimensions of the uterus among 263 premenopausal women (nulliparas, primiparas, multiparas) and menopausal women (less than or equal to five years of menopause, and greater than five years of menopause) with no uterine or ovarian pathological findings are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76299\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76299 \">table 4</a>). The average transverse width of the endometrial cavity (ie, inside dimension of the uterus) is 2.7 cm among nulliparas, 3.0 cm among primiparas, and 3.2 cm among multiparas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The typical measurement of endometrial thickness includes both the anterior and posterior endometrial walls. If fluid is present within the endometrial cavity, the anterior and posterior endometrial echoes can be measured independently and summed. Immediately after menses, the endometrium is 1 to 4 mm thick; as the estrogen concentration rises, the thickness increases to 7 to 10 mm. After ovulation, echogenicity increases starting in the basal area; by the luteal phase, the entire endometrium is hyperechogenic with a thickness of 8 to 16 mm. In postmenopausal women, a thick endometrial lining (defined as &gt;4 mm) can be a marker of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Multiple 2 to 5 mm follicles may be seen in the ovaries. A leading follicle of about 10 mm can be identified at the 9<sup>th</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup> cycle day; it grows rapidly and is 20 to 24 mm in diameter just before ovulation. After ovulation, the corpus luteum develops and may have a slightly heterogeneous consistency. The wall typically appears to be thick with low-level internal echoes and circumferential blood flow. The diameter of a normal follicle or corpus luteum does not usually exceed 30 mm. A corpus luteum cyst appears as a homogeneous hypoechogenic thin-walled structure. </p><p>Any abnormality noted should be described, as appropriate: size, shape, location, echogenicity, echo pattern (cystic, solid, complex, septations), and a differential diagnosis of the most likely causes of the abnormality should be provided. Additional studies, such as Doppler velocimetry or saline infusion sonohysterography, may be useful in defining suspected lesions, or three-dimensional sonography, which may be helpful for evaluating the uterine shape in those patients with infertility.</p><p>The use of ultrasound in gynecology and ultrasound images of gynecologic disorders can be found separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasonography of pregnancy of unknown location&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-evaluation-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound evaluation of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic floor sonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Translabial or transperineal ultrasound is being used increasingly to evaluate the pelvic floor in the work-up of women with pelvic organ prolapse and urinary or anal incontinence.

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Obstetrical sonography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sonography is an operator-dependent technology: A high level of proficiency can only be achieved by supervised experience with a large variety of normal and abnormal examinations. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Credentials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard orientation when performed using a transabdominal ultrasound probe is to hold it in the right hand with the mark on the thumb side, which is the side displayed on the left side of the ultrasound image. With a transvaginal probe, the mark on the probe represents the left side of the screen; therefore, if the probe is inserted into the vagina and the mark is held at 12:00, the left side of the image display represents the anterior aspect of the pelvis, and the right side of the image represents the posterior aspect of the pelvis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Transducers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manual adjustment of settings (size, depth, focal zone, gain, tissue harmonic imaging) is important to obtain optimal images. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Manual settings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Information gained from real-time ultrasound examination can be enhanced, when indicated, by additional studies using Doppler, sonohysterography, and three-dimensional imaging. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Advanced techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for obstetrical ultrasound examination vary by trimester and are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58590\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58590 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggested components of a basic obstetrical and gynecologic evaluation have been outlined by various groups. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Basic examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Gynecologic sonography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic ultrasound examination used appropriately has no harmful effects (including fetal effects). Nevertheless, examinations should be performed only for valid medical reasons, for the shortest amount of time, and with the lowest level of acoustic energy that allows diagnostic evaluation.
