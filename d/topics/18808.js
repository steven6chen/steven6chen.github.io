Increased knowledge of the pathophysiology of rosacea led to a 2017 update from the committee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-dermatology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The update supports a view of rosacea as a consistent multivariate disease process with multiple clinical manifestations and encourages replacement of subtype classification with a phenotype-based system. The phenotype-based approach incorporates recognition of diagnostic features (eg, fixed centrofacial erythema in a characteristic pattern and phymatous skin changes), major features (eg, flushing, papules, pustules, telangiectasia, and certain ocular manifestations), and several secondary features. The presence of at least one diagnostic feature or two major features is diagnostic of rosacea. This approach also facilitates treatment selection for patients with multiple manifestations of this disease.

A recent randomized trial provides further evidence of the lack of effectiveness of probiotics for eczema prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-dermatology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this trial, 184 high-risk infants received either<em> Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> GG plus inulin or inulin alone for the first six months of life. Eczema was diagnosed by age two in approximately 30 percent of the children in both groups. We suggest not giving probiotics during pregnancy and infancy for the prevention of eczema.

A single-center retrospective study of children with alopecia areata found the risk of thyroid abnormalities was increased among children with Down syndrome, atopy, or a family history of thyroid disease, and suggested that limiting screening to certain populations may be reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-dermatology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While this study provides a basis for additional research, we continue to screen all children with alopecia areata for thyroid disease, pending additional data to support other screening strategies.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an approximately 18 percent increase in the rate of primary and secondary syphilis (the most infectious stages of the disease) in 2016, with 8.7 cases per 100,000 population, the highest rate since 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-dermatology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. More than 600 cases of congenital syphilis were also reported. Although syphilis rates increased among men and women, the rise was primarily attributable to men who have sex with men (MSM). These findings stress the importance of screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infection, especially in MSM and pregnant women.

In one trial involving over 420 patients with active PsA, an inadequate response to at least one conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, and who were tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor-na&iuml;ve, the addition of either tofacitinib (in two doses) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> resulted in superior response rates to placebo at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-dermatology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Responses were maintained through one year, and physical function was also improved.

More recently, in a placebo-controlled trial involving over 360 patients with active PsA, it was found to provide benefit to patients who were refractory to, intolerant of, or had loss of efficacy to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-dermatology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Benefit in PsA was seen in a randomized trial comparing abatacept with placebo in over 420 patients with active PsA, plaque psoriasis, and an inadequate response or intolerance to at least one nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; about 60 percent also had prior exposure to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-dermatology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Composite criteria for at least 20 percent improvement (an ACR20) was achieved more often in the patients receiving abatacept at week 24 (39 versus 22 percent). We would use abatacept in situations where other drugs have failed or have contraindications, given its modest benefit both for arthritis and skin disease.

A Delphi consensus of international experts led to new, validated diagnostic criteria designed to facilitate the diagnosis of PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-dermatology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These criteria include a single major criterion (a biopsy from the ulcer edge demonstrating a neutrophilic infiltrate) and eight minor criteria, including histologic, history, clinical examination, and treatment findings.
