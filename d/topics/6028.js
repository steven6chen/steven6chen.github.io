(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>There are several histologic types of endometrial carcinoma (EC). Endometrioid histology is the most common, and this typically presents at an early stage with abnormal uterine bleeding, and is most common in postmenopausal women.

Endometrial carcinomas (ECs) are broadly classified into two major types based upon clinicopathologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 neoplasms are low-grade endometrioid ECs (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] grades 1 and 2), which comprise the majority of all ECs. These tumors are stimulated by estrogen, are typically are preceded by endometrial hyperplasia (also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia [EIN]), present at an early stage, and have a good prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 neoplasms include FIGO grade 3 endometrioid ECs and the nonendometrioid histologies: serous, clear cell, mixed cell, and undifferentiated. These neoplasms are not estrogen sensitive and often occur in the presence of an atrophic endometrium. They are high grade and have a poor prognosis. Carcinosarcomas also fall into this group.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16525784\"><span class=\"h1\">GROSS PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women undergoing hysterectomy for EC, gross examination of the uterine specimen is typically performed intraoperatively. This may help to guide decisions regarding lymph node evaluation (ie, whether to perform lymphadenectomy, extent of lymphadenectomy).</p><p>EC may involve part of the endometrium, the entire endometrial surface, or, less frequently, an endometrial polyp. When grossly visible, for example, with hysteroscopy, the endometrium appears thickened with an irregular shaggy or polypoid appearance.</p><p>During hysterectomy for EC, the uterine specimen is usually bivalved and examined grossly intraoperatively. Gross visualization can determine:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diameter of the lesion &ndash; Tumor diameter &gt;2 cm is associated with increased risk of nodal metastasis for endometrioid ECs, regardless of grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myometrial invasion &ndash; Myometrial invasion may be grossly apparent when there is a projection of tumor extending into the myometrium from a lesion in the cavity. Some carcinomas invade the myometrium in a more diffuse pattern that cannot be appreciated on gross inspection. Gross evaluation of myometrial invasion is also difficult in the presence of leiomyomas or adenomyosis, which distort the normal uterine anatomy.</p><p/><p>To guide intraoperative decisions regarding lymph node evaluation, the depth of myometrial invasion combined with tumor grade helps the surgeon determine the need for lymph node evaluation, particularly in low-grade tumors. Many centers in the United States use frozen section intraoperatively to microscopically assess the depth of myometrial invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Both gross inspection and frozen section can induce artifacts and be inaccurate, but in a meta-analysis of 35 studies, intraoperative frozen section had higher sensitivity and specificity (85 and 97 percent) than gross examination (71 and 91 percent) for the assessment of deep myometrial invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The relative proportions of each histologic type in one study are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109367\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109367 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16525797\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometrioid carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrioid histology is the most common type of EC, accounting for 75 to 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These tumors are stimulated by estrogen, are typically are preceded by endometrial hyperplasia (also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia [EIN]), present at an early stage, and have a good prognosis.</p><p>Endometrioid EC is composed of tall columnar cells lining back-to-back glands without intervening stroma. The glands have a smooth luminal contour. Cribriform (gland within a gland) patterns are also common. Occasionally, endometrioid ECs have a prominent papillary or villoglandular growth pattern.</p><p>Squamous differentiation is common in endometrioid ECs and is not included in assessment of solid growth when determining grade. Marked nuclear atypia (nuclear grade 3) raises the grade by one from 1 to 2, or 2 to 3. A binary International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grading scheme for endometrioid adenocarcinoma has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Several variant types of endometrioid EC are recognized, including carcinomas with squamous differentiation and carcinomas with prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles (secretory carcinoma).</p><p>Endometrioid ECs are graded using the FIGO classification system, which assesses the architectural pattern and nuclear grade:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 &ndash; Less than 5 percent solid growth patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108723 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2 &ndash; 6 to 50 percent solid growth patterns</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 &ndash; Greater than 50 percent solid growth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108724\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108724 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p>Most endometrioid ECs express estrogen and progesterone receptor proteins. Myometrial invasion, if present, may have either an infiltrative pattern with reactive stromal fibrosis and inflammatory cells (&quot;desmoplastic reaction&quot;) or a more subtle pushing pattern (large nests of tumors extend into the myometrium without eliciting a stromal reaction). An unusual pattern seen with grade 1 endometrioid ECs, the microcystic elongated and fragmented pattern (MELF), is associated with lymphovascular invasion and nodal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H511111496\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucinous carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucinous EC,<strong> </strong>by World Health Organization (WHO) definition, is composed of &gt;50 percent mucinous cells, and the remainder of the tumor shows endometrioid morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These are type 1 tumors, which are graded using the FIGO system. These tumors are typically low grade with a good prognosis.</p><p>Biopsy results of a mucinous EC may be difficult to interpret and this tumor may confused with endocervical adenocarcinoma, or a biopsy specimen may lack diagnostic features of carcinoma due to a fragmented papillary pattern of growth.</p><p>There is a high prevalence of <em>KRAS</em> mutations in this type of tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16525804\"><span class=\"h2\">Serous carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serous carcinoma<strong> </strong>is the second most common type of EC but only accounts for about 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Most serous endometrial carcinomas have a worse prognosis, as there is frequently clinically occult extrauterine disease present at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Tumor may be present on peritoneal surfaces, similar to ovarian carcinoma. Serous carcinoma confined to the endometrium (or a polyp) with minimal myometrial invasion and no distant disease after surgical staging has a good prognosis.</p><p>In serous EC, the neoplastic cells form papillary structures and glands with serrated outlines. The cells have marked nuclear atypia with prominent nucleoli and numerous mitotic figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108725\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108725 \">picture 3</a>). Occasionally a serous carcinoma is composed primarily of glands, but the marked nuclear atypia is a key to proper tumor classification. Psammoma bodies may be present.</p><p>Serous carcinomas often diffusely infiltrate the myometrium and may have extensive lymphovascular space invasion and peritoneal spread, similar to ovarian carcinoma.</p><p>Serous carcinomas are usually strongly p53 protein positive by immunohistochemistry, reflecting accumulation of the mutant nuclear protein. p53-null serous carcinoma can also be seen if the mutation results in a protein that is not detected by the antibody. The high proliferative rate of this carcinoma can be confirmed by Ki67 (MIB-1) immunohistochemistry.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16525815\"><span class=\"h2\">Clear cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clear cell EC is an uncommon histologic type (&lt;5 percent) of EC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Like serous carcinoma, this tumor is typically high grade and often presents at an advanced stage.</p><p>Clear cell EC has several different architectural patterns: papillary, glandular, tubulocystic, and diffuse, composed of cells with abundant clear cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F108726\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108726 \">picture 4</a>). The large abnormal nuclei may project into the lumen of the glands, giving a &quot;hobnail&quot; pattern. The stroma of the papillae in clear cell carcinoma has a characteristic hyalinized glassy appearance.</p><p>Clear cell carcinomas are typically negative for estrogen receptor protein and p53 protein, and can be positive for Napsin A by immunohistochemistry. This can aid in distinguishing this form of high-grade carcinoma from its mimics, which are serous carcinoma and the secretory variant of endometrioid EC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16525822\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixed cell tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mixed carcinoma with both endometrioid and high-grade nonendometrioid patterns (usually serous) may occur.

They often form a large polyp, completely filling the endometrial cavity.</p><p>The sarcoma component may be composed of cell types usually seen in the uterus, such as smooth muscle and endometrial stroma (homologous tumors), or unusual tissue such as cartilage, bone, and skeletal muscle (heterologous tumors).</p><p>Uterine carcinosarcomas were originally classified as sarcomas, but are now recognized as metaplastic carcinoma based on clonality studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In this histology, the epithelial component (carcinoma) has undergone mesenchymal transformation, forming patterns of sarcoma. The epithelial component is frequently serous carcinoma, and carcinosarcomas are considered high-grade type 2 tumors.

This causes continued proliferation of the endometrium, leading to endometrial hyperplasia and subsequent adenocarcinoma. Risk factors associated with increased exposure of the endometrium to estrogen include nulliparity, early menarche, late menopause, and estrogen-producing tumors (eg, ovarian granulosa cell tumors). Postmenopausal estrogen therapy without progesterone increases the risk of EC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Excess estrogen exposure'</a>.)</p><p>Women with obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and type 2 diabetes mellitus are at high risk for this type of EC due to relative higher concentration of estrogens due to aromatization of androstenedione to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> in adipose tissue. It is unclear if the increased risk associated with diabetes mellitus is solely related to coexisting obesity or if there is an independent effect of diabetes, since insulin resistance may play an independent role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Endometrioid ECs occur most commonly in postmenopausal women. This type of neoplasm may also occur in young (premenopausal) women with chronic anovulation, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or obesity. Nonobese women with PCOS show insulin resistance, again suggesting this is a separate risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Progestin therapy may be used in selected women with EC as these carcinomas are usually progesterone receptor positive.</p><p>Many different genetic changes have been identified in these neoplasms, including mutations in <em>PTEN</em>, <em>KRAS</em>, <em>ARID1A</em>, <em>PIK3CA</em>, and <em>CTNNB1</em>, and microsatellite instability (MSI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. <em>PTEN</em> inactivation appears to be an early event in carcinogenesis and can be detected in early clonal premalignant lesions, known as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN), or atypical endometrial hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>MSI is found on pathology evaluation in approximately one-third of endometrioid ECs and is most frequently due to inactivation of the mismatch repair protein MLH1 by hypermethylation. This is a different mechanism than that seen in carcinomas associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (HNPCC), or Lynch syndrome, in which there is a germline mutation in one of the mismatch repair proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

This intraepithelial neoplasm is characterized by a single layer of highly atypical (neoplastic) cells lining the surface of the endometrial cavity or a polyp. EIC contains mutations of <em>p53</em>, similar to serous carcinoma, indicating this is an early event in serous carcinogenesis. Serous carcinomas show high levels of aneuploidy, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification, and <em>p16</em> alterations.</p><p>Clear cell carcinomas have not been as well studied as serous carcinoma, although a clear cell intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasm/carcinoma</span> has been described as a precursor lesion for this neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Mutation analysis of these carcinomas showed a lack of the alterations in <em>POLE, PTEN</em>, and <em>CTNNB1</em> seen in endometrioid ECs and the presence of several mutations frequently seen in serous carcinomas, but rarely <em>p53</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

This group included low-grade endometrioid ECs (60 percent), high-grade endometrioid ECs (8.7 percent), serous carcinomas (2.3 percent), and mixed-histology carcinomas (25 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Copy number high (serous-like) group &ndash; This group included 97.7 percent of serous carcinomas, 75 percent of mixed histology carcinomas, 5 percent of low-grade endometrioid ECs, and 19.6 percent of grade 3 endometrioid ECs in the TCGA cohort. These tumors have a high degree of somatic copy number alterations (duplications of segments of the genome) with frequent <em>p53</em> mutations (90 percent), as well as amplifications of the <em>MYC</em> and <em>ERBB2</em> oncogenes. These tumors have a significantly worse progression-free survival.</p><p/><p>It is noteworthy that all four genomic groups contain low-grade endometrioid ECs, which indicates that the genomic profile can be very different in tumors with identical histologic patterns. Interestingly, many grade 3 endometrioid ECs had a genomic profile similar to serous carcinomas, with high copy number alterations and <em>p53</em> mutations. This adds to the controversy as to whether grade 3 endometrioid ECs should be considered a type 1 tumor or be grouped with the other high-grade type 2 tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-histopathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Such a genomic-based classification may lead to new diagnostic and treatment approaches, with targeted therapy for advanced disease based on the underlying genetically altered pathways and individual genes in the tumor rather than the histologic subtype and tumor grade.

Endometrioid histology is the most common (75 to 80 percent of cases). Other histologic types include: serous, mucinous, clear cell, mixed cell, and carcinosarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H16525791\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine carcinosarcomas were originally classified as sarcomas; the epithelial component (carcinoma) has undergone mesenchymal transformation, forming patterns of sarcoma. The epithelial component is frequently serous carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H16525829\" class=\"local\">'Carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed m&uuml;llerian tumor)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrial carcinomas are generally classified into type 1 and type 2 carcinomas. Type 1 neoplasms are low-grade endometrioid carcinomas (grades 1 and 2), which comprise the majority of all endometrial carcinomas. Type 2 neoplasms include International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grade 3 endometrioid carcinomas and the nonendometrioid histologies: serous, clear cell, mixed cell, undifferentiated, and carcinosarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H16525777\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrioid carcinomas are typically stimulated by estrogen, present at an early stage with abnormal uterine bleeding, and are most common in postmenopausal women. Mucinous carcinomas are also typically low grade and have a good prognosis. Nonendometrioid tumors are not estrogen sensitive and often occur in the presence of an atrophic endometrium. They are high grade and have a poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H16525791\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing hysterectomy for endometrial carcinoma, gross examination of the uterine specimen is typically performed intraoperatively. Gross examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frozen section may help to guide the lymph node evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H16525784\" class=\"local\">'Gross pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of the United States National Cancer Institute classified endometrial carcinomas into four major genomic subtypes: <em>POLE</em> (DNA polymerase &epsilon;) ultramutated group, <span class=\"nowrap\">hypermutated/microsatellite</span> unstable (MSI) group, copy number <span class=\"nowrap\">low/microsatellite</span> stable group, and copy number high (serous-like) group. (See <a href=\"#H16525872\" class=\"local\">'Genomic subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microsatellite instability is found upon pathology evaluation in approximately one-third of endometrioid carcinomas and is most frequently due to inactivation of the mismatch repair protein MLH1 by hypermethylation. This is a different mechanism than that seen in carcinomas associated with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome [HNPCC]), in which there is a germline mutation in one of the mismatch repair proteins. (See <a href=\"#H16525872\" class=\"local\">'Genomic subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary cancer syndromes that predispose to an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma are Lynch and Cowden syndromes. All histologic types of endometrial carcinoma can be seen in Lynch syndrome. Histopathologic features such as a lower uterine segment primary site, the presence of a high-grade (&quot;dedifferentiated&quot;) component, and prominent tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes have been described in endometrial carcinomas in these patients.
