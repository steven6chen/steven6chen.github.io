An abnormal urinalysis with or without an elevated plasma creatinine concentration is present in a large proportion of patients at the time of diagnosis of lupus nephritis. The most frequently observed abnormality in patients with lupus nephritis is proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Clinical findings underestimate the true frequency of renal involvement, as some patients may (rarely) have significant pathologic abnormalities without any clinical signs of renal involvement. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Silent lupus nephritis'</a> below.)</p><p>There are several types of renal disease in SLE (most commonly, immune complex-mediated glomerular disease), which are usually differentiated with a renal biopsy. In addition, renal diseases that are unrelated to lupus may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>An overview of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and classification of lupus nephritis will be presented here. The indications for renal biopsy and the approach to therapy in the different types of lupus nephritis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-renal-biopsy-in-patients-with-lupus-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for renal biopsy in patients with lupus nephritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-diffuse-or-focal-proliferative-lupus-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of diffuse or focal proliferative lupus nephritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-therapy-of-lupus-membranous-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and therapy of lupus membranous nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pattern of glomerular injury seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (and in other immune complex-mediated glomerular diseases) is primarily related to the site of formation of the immune deposits, which are primarily due to anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA, or anti-DNA). These antibodies bind DNA in various forms, such as DNA in the form of nucleosomes, which consist of dsDNA wound around a core histone octamer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-DNA immune complex formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These immune complexes are primarily composed of DNA and anti-DNA. However, immune complexes may also have as their components chromatin, C1q, laminin, Sm, La (SS-B), Ro (SS-A), ubiquitin, and ribosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>]. In addition to forming immune complexes with DNA, some anti-DNA antibodies may bind directly to components of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and mesangium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The immune deposits in lupus nephritis can occur in the mesangium, subendothelial, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subepithelial compartments of the glomerulus. </p><p>Deposits in the <strong>mesangium</strong> and <strong>subendothelial</strong> space are proximal to the GBM and are therefore in communication with the vascular space. As a result, activation of complement (typically via the classical pathway) with the generation of the chemoattractants, C3a and C5a, results in the influx of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. These changes are manifest histologically by a mesangial or focal or diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis and clinically by an active urine sediment (red cells, white cells, and cellular and granular casts), proteinuria, and, often, an acute decline in renal function. </p><p>Although deposits in the <strong>subepithelial</strong> space can also activate complement, there is no influx of inflammatory cells, since the chemoattractants are separated from the circulation by the GBM. Thus, injury is limited to the glomerular epithelial cells, and the primary clinical manifestation is proteinuria, which is often in the nephrotic range. Histologically, these patients most commonly have membranous nephropathy.</p><p>The site of immune complex formation is related to the characteristics of both the antigen and antibody:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large intact immune complexes or anionic antigens (which cannot cross the anionic charge barrier in the glomerular capillary wall) are deposited in the mesangium and subendothelial space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The degree of immune deposition then determines whether the patient develops mild disease limited to the mesangium or a more severe focal or diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. Experimental studies suggest that there are two primary mechanisms by which subepithelial deposits may form: a cationic antigen that can cross the GBM; and an autoantibody directed against epithelial cell antigens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of immune injury of the glomerulus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another important determinant of the site of immune complex formation may be related both to the charge of the antibody and to its antigen-binding region. The antibody may bind to antigens at different sites in the glomerular capillary wall, thereby leading to different histologic and clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/10,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15,16</a>]. Some data suggest that intraglomerular membrane-associated nucleosomes are targeted by anti-dsDNA autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all circulating anti-DNA antibodies in SLE are necessarily nephritogenic. One study, for example, compared 14 patients with both anti-DNA antibodies and active nephritis with 14 patients who had anti-DNA antibodies but no nephritis. The plasma anti-DNA antibodies in these clinically disparate groups were indistinguishable based upon isotype, charge, or cross-reactivity with histones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although not examined in the patients of this study, other studies have shown that anti-DNA antibodies capable of fixing complement are more nephritogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>In addition, the nephrotoxicity of anti-DNA may not require immune complex formation. Anti-DNA antibodies appear to bind to human mesangial cells in vitro and induce production of proinflammatory substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In an in vitro system, for example, anti-DNA isolated during active lupus nephritis induced mesangial cell production of interleukin-1 (and other proinflammatory substances), which in turn increased synthesis of hyaluronan (an extracellular matrix component that accumulates during tissue injury and recruits lymphocytes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The plasma cells that secrete these autoantibodies have been located not just in the spleen and bone marrow, but also in the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, the kidney may be a major site of autoreactive plasma cells in lupus nephritis.</p><p>Some data suggest that autoantibodies against C1q, a complement component, may correlate with lupus nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. The mechanism of action of these antibodies may be initiated by the general deposition of immune complexes on the GBM, with C1q being fixed on these immune complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Subsequent binding of anti-C1q antibodies to C1q activates complement, resulting in an influx of inflammatory cells.</p><p>It has also been suggested that the IgG subclass may be a determinant of the inflammatory response that is induced by immune complex deposition. IgG1 and IgG3 fix complement, while IgG2 does so less avidly, and IgG4 does not fix complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, the latter two subclasses are less likely to induce inflammation. Consistent with this hypothesis are the observations that anti-DNA antibodies associated with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis tend to be IgG1 and IgG3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], while the immune deposits in membranous nephropathy are more likely to be IgG2 and IgG4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, as noted above, the separation of the immune deposits from inflammatory cells in the circulation by the GBM may be a more important reason why an inflammatory change is lacking in membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Immune complex deposition can activate other arms of the inflammatory response:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upregulation and activation of adhesion molecules on endothelium can result in the recruitment of proinflammatory leukocytes and the initiation of autoimmune injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Elevated anti-DNA titers and low complement (C3 and C4) levels often indicate active lupus, particularly lupus nephritis, although the utility of serological assessment differs among patients. The frequency of testing depends upon whether or not the patient has a previous history of renal involvement. In patients who have never been diagnosed with renal disease, this evaluation is typically performed by a rheumatologist. These issues are discussed elsewhere.

The only other circumstances in which these structures are prominent are in HIV nephropathy (associated with chronically high levels of circulating alpha-interferon) and treatment with alpha-interferon.

Over the last two decades, there have been several attempts by different societies to classify the different glomerulopathies associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</p><p>Based upon clinicopathologic correlations, a lupus nephritis classification system was developed by a group of renal pathologists, nephrologists, and rheumatologists in 2004 (the Renal Pathology <span class=\"nowrap\">Society/International</span> Society of Nephrology, or <span class=\"nowrap\">RPS/ISN,</span> classification) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>].

Although the different classes tend to have distinct histologic, clinical, and prognostic characteristics, there is substantial overlap due in part to variations in sampling. Ideally, the biopsy specimen should contain at least 25 glomeruli. In addition, a significant percentage of patients evolve from one class of lupus nephritis to another, sometimes after therapy and sometimes spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/59,65-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,65-69</a>]. The evolution from one class of nephritis to another is not surprising, since the different histologic types represent nonspecific responses to immune complex deposition.</p><p>Various serologic and urine markers have been examined as potential noninvasive determinants of histologic class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], including the combination of an elevated anti-DNA titer and low complement levels, anti-C1q antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

As a result, a biopsy is not usually performed. Patients with class I disease have only mesangial immune deposits that are identified by immunofluorescence alone or by both immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, but such patients do not have light microscopic abnormalities. Minimal mesangial lupus nephritis (class I) represents the earliest and mildest form of glomerular involvement.

A few isolated subepithelial or subendothelial deposits may be seen on immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. Visible subendothelial deposits on light microscopy or any global or segmental glomerular scars (which are thought to be the result of previous endocapillary proliferation, necrosis, or crescents) are inconsistent with the diagnosis of class II lupus nephritis. Such findings would indicate either class III or IV disease. Extensive podocyte effacement with nephrotic syndrome can rarely be seen, resembling minimal change disease if there is an associated podocytopathy. The renal prognosis with mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis is excellent, and no specific therapy is indicated unless the patient progresses to more advanced disease or has evidence of extensive podocyte effacement and nephrosis.

The most frequent manifestations are immune complex deposition (which is typically associated with immune deposits in the glomeruli), immunoglobulin microvascular &quot;thrombi,&quot; a thrombotic microangiopathy leading to a syndrome similar to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), vasculitis, or atheroembolic disease and atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/82,100,102-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,100,102-104</a>]. </p><p>Vascular immune deposits are usually located beneath an intact endothelium. They typically produce no inflammation; however, fibrinoid necrosis with vascular narrowing can be seen in severe cases, often in association with moderate to severe hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. It is unclear in this setting whether the hypertension contributes to the vascular injury <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> whether the vascular narrowing exacerbates the hypertension via activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Regardless of the pathogenesis, patients with necrotizing vasculopathy tend to have a worse renal prognosis than those with isolated glomerular disease.</p><p>Rarely, patients with lupus nephritis develop renal vein thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. These patients are typically nephrotic or have high antiphospholipid antibody levels, and the pathogenesis and treatment of the renal vein thrombosis are similar to that in patients without lupus.

The name &quot;LA&quot; refers to the ability of these antibodies to produce in vitro prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time. In vivo, however, antiphospholipid antibodies promote coagulation, leading to venous and arterial thromboses, thrombocytopenia, livedo reticularis, and, in women, frequent miscarriages.

In one study, for example, kidney biopsy was offered to all patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) seen at a Japanese hospital over an 11-year period, whether or not clinical signs of renal disease were present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Of the 195 patients who had adequate biopsies, 86 had no clinical renal involvement. Of these 86 patients without clinical renal disease, 13 (15 percent) had either class III or IV lupus nephritis, and 9 (10 percent) had class V (membranous) disease. </p><p>The renal disease in patients with silent lupus nephritis often remains clinically silent and is associated with a benign renal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/107,108,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108,111</a>].

In a retrospective study of 470 renal biopsies from patients with SLE, biopsies with normal light microscopy or a histologic diagnosis of either focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis were further evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The absence of endocapillary proliferation or necrosis, or of electron-dense glomerular basement membranes (GBM) deposits, was found in 18 such biopsies, of which eight were from patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria. At least 80 percent foot process effacement was observed in all but one of these eight patients.</p><p>There is a possibility that these observations reflect the chance occurrence of SLE and either minimal change nephropathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. However, this should occur in less than 1 in 10,000 cases, a frequency that is much less than that observed in this study (7 of 470). In addition, the onset of podocytopathy in these patients is seen most commonly at the onset of SLE or in the setting of a disease flare. </p><p>The presence of severe foot process effacement in the absence of deposits in the glomerular capillary wall implies a mechanism that is independent of immune complex deposition, presumably similar to the mechanism of primary minimal change disease or primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Proposed explanations include production of a cytokine or lymphokine toxic to podocytes, or podocyte injury driven by T cell dysfunction. A number of lupus podocytopathy cases have been linked to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use for SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/112-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">112-114</a>].</p><p>Patients with a lupus-related podocytopathy often respond to a short course of high-dose glucocorticoids, similar to patients with isolated minimal change disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-classification-of-renal-disease-in-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].

The most frequently observed abnormality is proteinuria.

A classification system formulated and published in 2004 divides the glomerular disorders into six different patterns or classes based upon kidney biopsy findings. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class I disease (minimal mesangial lupus nephritis) is characterized by mesangial immune deposits that are identified either by immunofluorescence alone or by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, but without light microscopic abnormalities. Patients with class I disease generally have a normal urinalysis and serum creatinine concentration. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Minimal mesangial lupus nephritis (class I)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class II disease (mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis) is characterized by mesangial hypercellularity or mesangial matrix expansion on light microscopy. A few isolated subepithelial or subendothelial deposits may be seen on immunofluorescence or electron microscopy, but no subendothelial deposits are visible on light microscopy. Patients present with microscopic hematuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria; hypertension is uncommon, and the nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency are virtually never seen.

Lesions are associated with focal subendothelial deposits on electron microscopy. Class III disease is further categorized depending upon the chronicity of the lesions. Hematuria and proteinuria are seen in almost all patients, some of whom also have the nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevated plasma creatinine concentration. Progressive renal dysfunction is uncommon when fewer than 25 percent of glomeruli are affected and when glomeruli show only segmental areas of proliferation without necrosis.

Class IV disease is further categorized into segmental (IV-S) and global (IV-G) depending upon whether affected glomeruli have segmental or global lesions, respectively. Additional subclasses of class IV disease are categorized depending upon the chronicity of the lesions. Hematuria and proteinuria are present in all patients with active disease, and nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and renal insufficiency are frequently observed.
