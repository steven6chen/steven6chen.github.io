First developed in 1914 as an appetite suppressant, MDMA found use as a psychotherapeutic agent during the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, its potential for abuse was quickly recognized, leading government agencies to place tight restrictions on its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>MDMA is a commonly abused drug, particularly among young party-goers at electronic dance music venues, including dance clubs and large music festivals. Typical effects include feelings of euphoria, wakefulness, intimacy, sexual arousal, and disinhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The clinical features and management of acute MDMA intoxication will be reviewed here. A summary table to facilitate emergency management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57745\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57745 \">table 1</a>). Detailed discussions of related issues, such as serotonin syndrome, severe hyperthermia, and a general discussion of the poisoned patient are found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe nonexertional hyperthermia (classic heat stroke) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with occult toxic exposure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17436336\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abuse of MDMA fluctuates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Use among adults may be decreasing overall, but this may not be true of adolescents. In 1996, 5.7 percent of United States 12<sup>th</sup> grade students reported using MDMA, but in 2013 4.4 percent of 12<sup>th</sup> grade students did so. The number of younger users may be due in part to the erroneous belief that MDMA provides a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; high. In fact, MDMA shares toxicities with amphetamine, in addition to unique adverse effects, and adverse events including deaths associated with its use have increased since 2013. A number of electronic dance music festivals in the United States have experienced partygoer deaths from MDMA use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Most of these have onsite medical staff to provide medical attention for attendees, which regularly includes adverse events from drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Experimental use of MDMA to treat a number of psychiatric disorders (eg, posttraumatic stress) has increased in recent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. If MDMA becomes an FDA-approved medication, more persons may become exposed to MDMA. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also commonly called &ldquo;Molly&rdquo; or &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo;) is a sympathomimetic amphetamine that causes release of endogenous catecholamines (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a>) and blocks their reuptake into presynaptic vesicles.</p><p>MDMA differs somewhat from traditional amphetamines in that it is structurally similar to serotonin. This difference likely accounts for an increased release of serotonin and inhibition of serotonin reuptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/4,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,15</a>].</p><p>This results in a toxicity profile for MDMA that is different from that of traditional amphetamines. Although typical findings of amphetamine toxicity (hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, CNS stimulation) are often seen in MDMA toxicity, serotonergic toxicity (serotonin syndrome, SIADH) may be seen as well.</p><p>Over 100 congeners of MDMA exist. Tablets purported to contain MDMA may contain highly toxic MDMA analogs or completely different drugs altogether. Hair testing of individuals who take illicit drugs they believe to be MDMA demonstrate that these persons have actually been exposed to MDPV (methylenedioxypyrovalerone, one of the compounds known as &ldquo;bath salts&rdquo;) and numerous other similar novel psychoactive substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition to amphetamine derivatives, numerous other compounds are abused in a manner similar to MDMA. Many are sold illicitly by internet vendors, and these substances are often misrepresented as MDMA and sold to unknowing users. Such substances include phenylethylamines 2CB, 2CT2, 2CT7, DOM, Bromo-dragonfly, and the tryptamines DMT, 5 Meo-DMT, and &ldquo;Foxy.&rdquo; The effects of these agents may be similar to MDMA, but they may have greater potency, causing more severe hallucinations, greater serotonergic activity, and more severe overall toxicity. Management is similar to that described below for MDMA. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is typically ingested as a tablet in dosages ranging from 50 mg to 200 mg, and it is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak effects occur within two hours of ingestion and typically last four to six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Up to 75 percent of MDMA is excreted in the urine unchanged, while the remainder is primarily metabolized by the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>The concentrations of MDMA contained in illicitly produced pills vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Major toxicity and death may occur after ingestion of a single tablet; ingestion of larger quantities carries greater risk of toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) increases alertness, reduces fatigue, and leads to feelings of increased physical and mental powers, and euphoria. Users typically begin to experience the desired effects of MDMA approximately one hour following oral administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Minor adverse reactions, such as agitation, nausea, bruxism (grinding teeth), ataxia, diaphoresis, blurry vision, tachycardia, and hypertension, can also occur at typical MDMA doses. These effects are usually self-limited and resolve within hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. More serious effects are uncommon and described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Vital signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MDMA can cause hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Life-threatening increases in heart rate and blood pressure may occur. Cardiovascular toxicity can include hypertensive emergencies, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and dysrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>]. In addition, catastrophic central neurologic hemorrhage, including intracranial hemorrhage and posterior spinal artery aneurysm, has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperthermia and related effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperthermia may result from drug effects on the central nervous system (CNS), prolonged physical exertion (eg, dancing all night at a &quot;rave&quot;), and environmental conditions (eg, dancing in a densely populated, hot room). Both the stimulant effect of amphetamines and serotonin syndrome may contribute to severe hyperthermia in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/24,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29</a>]. Hyperthermia can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation and rhabdomyolysis. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Hyperthermia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Manifestations of hyponatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MDMA use can lead to hyponatremia due to a marked increase in fluid intake and in some patients, persistent secretion of antidiuretic hormone that slows the rate of water excretion. The belief among some MDMA users that they can avoid hyperthermia by drinking large amounts of water is the reason for increased fluid intake in many cases. The mechanisms that lead to hyponatremia are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H4659391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Ecstasy (MDMA) intoxication'</a>.)</p><p>Marked and often acute reductions in serum sodium can lead to serious neurologic manifestations including confusion, seizures, cerebral edema, cerebral herniation, and death. The serum sodium in such patients is usually below 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Young women appear to be at increased risk for both symptomatic hyponatremia and residual neurologic injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Susceptibility of premenopausal women'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stimulation of the CNS is common and can manifest as agitation, hyperactivity, anxiety, and even delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Seizures and status epilepticus can occur. Psychomotor agitation may be associated with hyperthermia as well as rhabdomyolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1222407\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatotoxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatotoxicity caused by MDMA poisoning is well recognized. Even in the absence of severe hyperthermia or disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, centrilobular necrosis, and hepatic fibrosis may result from MDMA abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Clinical findings are similar to other forms of toxin-induced hepatic injury and may include jaundice, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Elevations of bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) may be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotonin syndrome findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the triad of autonomic dysfunction, abnormal neuromuscular activity, and altered mental status. MDMA use can cause serotonin syndrome, presumably via stimulation of massive serotonin release. Individuals who use MDMA in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or other drugs that increase 5-HT1A receptor activity (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a>, tryptophan, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>) are at greater risk of developing serotonin syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other sympathomimetic drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine, may present with a clinical syndrome that is indistinguishable from MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) toxicity.

Skin findings are helpful in distinguishing the two syndromes: patients with anticholinergic toxicity generally present with reduced or absent sweating, whereas patients with MDMA toxicity are usually diaphoretic. The typical pattern of speech is also different for the two poisonings, frequently being clear but pressured for MDMA and resembling a &quot;mouthful of marbles&quot; with anticholinergic toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticholinergic-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticholinergic poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other causes of altered mental status, such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte disorders, intracranial hemorrhage, and infection should be considered. In particular, patients with hyperthermia and alteration in mental status who do not have a history strongly suggestive of MDMA or other drug intoxication should undergo lumbar puncture to rule out a CNS infection.

A positive MDMA screening test cannot confirm that a patient's symptoms are the result of MDMA toxicity. A negative test can occur despite the presence of MDMA congeners, of which there are over 100. Such congeners may cause clinical symptoms that are indistinguishable from MDMA toxicity. Regardless of whether the inciting agent is MDMA or a related drug, management is identical and based solely on the patient's clinical status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general approach to any poisoned patient must always begin with stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation. General discussions of the basic facets of the management of poisonings are found separately. Detailed management of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) intoxication and similar agents is discussed immediately below. A summary table to facilitate emergent management is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57745\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57745 \">table 1</a>).

Treatment of the central component is accomplished with sedatives; benzodiazepines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>, 1 to 2 mg IV push; may repeat until hypertension is controlled or patient is sedated) are appropriate first line agents. Hypertension refractory to aggressive benzodiazepine therapy is not typical, but can be treated with peripheral agents, such as sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> (standard doses) or the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a> (1 to 5 mg IV).</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phentolamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phentolamine</a> are standard initial therapies for stimulant-induced hypertension, these medications are not routinely available in some settings. In such cases, the calcium channel blockers <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a> or the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fenoldopam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fenoldopam</a> can decrease systemic vascular resistance without affecting the cardiac conduction system. Where other antihypertensive medications are not available, closely monitored use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, a mixed alpha-beta adrenergic antagonist, is reasonable. </p><p>The use of beta-blocking agents to control pulse or blood pressure in sympathomimetic poisoning is controversial. Pure beta-blocking agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, may lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, may exacerbate coronary artery vasospasm, and increase lethality in animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].</p><p>Data relating to the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> is less clear.

Opponents emphasize that intravenous labetalol acts almost entirely as a beta blocking agent (ratio of beta to alpha blockade is 7:1), and increases mortality in an animal model of sympathomimetic poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p>Given the availability of other antihypertensive agents and the controversy that surrounds this issue, we suggest against the use of pure beta blocking agents in the treatment of hypertension associated with MDMA poisoning, and support cautious use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> in circumstances where other options are unavailable. </p><p>Indiscriminate fluid resuscitation should be avoided, as it may cause or exacerbate MDMA-associated hyponatremia. In the event the patient truly appears hypovolemic (as demonstrated by poor skin turgor or dry mucous membranes), normal saline may be administered until euvolemia is obtained. Tachycardia is <strong>NOT</strong> an appropriate surrogate endpoint for dehydration, as many patients with MDMA toxicity are tachycardic due to the sympathomimetic effects of the drug.</p><p>Isolated tachycardia not associated with hypertension rarely requires treatment. In the unlikely event of a supraventricular tachycardia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> or calcium channel blockers may be used.

We prefer benzodiazepines as first-line agents, as they have an excellent safety profile and are readily available. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a> (1 to 2 mg IV) has a rapid onset of sedative effects; repeat doses may be administered until agitation is controlled. Very high doses of benzodiazepines (ie, greater than 10 mg of lorazepam) may be required.</p><p>Butyrophenones (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a>) interfere with heat dissipation, may prolong the QTc, and may reduce the seizure threshold. Given that hyperthermia and seizures are known consequences of MDMA toxicity, we suggest that butyrophenones <strong>NOT</strong> be used.</p><p>Minimizing stimuli, such as light and noise, is helpful. Physical restraint should be avoided, if possible, and should only be used until the patient can be chemically sedated. Antipsychotic agents are not indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperthermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An accurate core body temperature should be obtained. Severe hyperthermia (temperature &gt;41&ordm;C; 107&ordm;F) can be managed by immersion in an ice bath, if feasible, until the core temperature is reduced to 100&ordm;F. The temperature may continue to drop slightly after exiting an ice bath, but this after-drop is typically mild. Moderate hyperthermia should be treated with other cooling measures, including cooling blankets and the combination of cool water mist with fanning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe nonexertional hyperthermia (classic heat stroke) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If hyperthermia from serotonin syndrome is suspected, initial treatment with benzodiazepines and possibly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproheptadine</a> is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mdma-ecstasy-intoxication/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>]. If hyperthermia is refractory to these measures, intubation and paralysis should be performed.

However, as mentioned above, MDMA use may be associated with the development of severe hyponatremia that can lead to neurologic symptoms (eg, confusion, seizures), cerebral edema, brain herniation, and death. The serum sodium is usually less than 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. </p><p>Patients with marked neurologic symptoms should be treated initially with hypertonic saline (3 percent or 513 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span>. One regimen that we have used was initially described in hyponatremic athletes participating in endurance events, such as marathon races, an acute form of hyponatremia similar to ecstasy intoxication. It consists of 100 mL of 3 percent saline given as an intravenous bolus, which should acutely raise the serum sodium concentration by 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(mmol/L),</span> thereby reducing the degree of cerebral edema. If neurologic symptoms persist or worsen, a 100 mL bolus of 3 percent saline can be repeated one or two more times at 10 minute intervals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-associated-hyponatremia#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-associated hyponatremia&quot;, section on 'Use of hypertonic saline'</a>.)</p><p>The serum sodium is monitored closely. Overly rapid correction in patients with marked hyponatremia for two days or more is associated with an increased risk of severe and often irreversible neurologic injury, called osmotic demyelination. However, patients with very acute hyponatremia, as occurs in ecstasy intoxication and exercise-associated hyponatremia, are at minimal risk for this complication. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osmotic-demyelination-syndrome-ods-and-overly-rapid-correction-of-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures, whether or not they are associated with hyponatremia, are treated with benzodiazepines and (if necessary) appropriate correction of the patient's serum sodium as described in the preceding section. The mechanism of MDMA-induced seizures makes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> an illogical treatment choice, and we do not recommend its use. Seizures that occur in the setting of drug intoxication typically result from an altered balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. This mechanism is distinct from that of patients with a known seizure disorder, who generally have electrical instability in a discrete area of brain tissue amenable to treatment with sodium channel blocking agents, such as phenytoin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotonin syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines, with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproheptadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproheptadine</a>, remain the mainstay of treatment.
