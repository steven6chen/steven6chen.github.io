On multivariate analysis, surgical closure was associated with a significant reduction in 10-year mortality after adjusting for baseline characteristics (5 versus 16 percent with medical therapy, adjusted relative risk 0.31). In addition, there was a much lower likelihood of functional deterioration compared with the medical group (11 versus 34 percent, adjusted relative risk 0.21) and a higher likelihood of improved functional status (32 versus 3 percent).

It has been suggested that, in this setting, maintenance of interatrial communication provides a mechanism to maintain cardiac output at the expense of desaturation and this may be advantageous.

The evaluation of the likely cause of stroke should include consideration of cardiovascular risk factors (eg, age and presence of diabetes mellitus) associated with increased risk of alternate causes of stroke.

The risk for paradoxical embolism with ASD appears to be highest in patients with other risk factors such as tricuspid regurgitation related to Ebstein anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-closure-and-medical-management-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There are limited data on the efficacy of ASD closure in patients with ASD and presumed paradoxical embolism. The evidence for ASD closure is largely indirect from randomized trials in patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke showing decreased risk of recurrent stroke after PFO closure compared with medical therapy alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-patent-foramen-ovale-pfo-for-secondary-stroke-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of patent foramen ovale (PFO) for secondary stroke prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with an ASD are at risk for paradoxical embolization when right-to-left shunting occurs (leading to stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral emboli). In the majority of patients with net left-to-right shunts, intermittent right-to-left shunting can occur during transient increases in right-sided pressure (eg, with a Valsalva maneuver or coughing). A minority of patients have positional right-to-left shunt (orthodeoxia-platypnea); these patients may benefit from ASD closure. Occasionally, primarily right-to-left shunting occurs in the presence of severe pulmonary hypertension; these patients are generally not candidates for ASD closure.

Gene mutations causing ASDs have been identified among patients with familial or sporadic disease, including mutations of NKX2.5, causing an autosomal dominant syndrome of ASD with or without conduction defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-closure-and-medical-management-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Genetic syndromes with skeletal abnormalities associated with ASD include a variety of heart-hand syndromes, which also have autosomal dominant transmission. Holt-Oram syndrome (caused by mutations in the TBX5 gene) is the best known of these heart-hand syndromes.
