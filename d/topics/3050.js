This condition is typically the end result of a variety of pathophysiologic processes that render the bronchial walls weakened, easily collapsible, chronically inflamed, and plugged with mucus secretions.</p><p>In resource-rich countries, cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common cause of bronchiectasis in children. The evaluation and management of CF-related bronchiectasis is discussed in detail in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-of-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations of pulmonary disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Bronchiectasis can be caused by a variety of disease processes other than CF, most of which include some combination of bronchial obstruction and infection. The types of disorders that cause bronchiectasis vary among populations and age groups. As examples, infections and acquired causes of bronchiectasis predominate in adults and in resource-limited countries, whereas congenital anomalies of the airways or immune system are more prominent in children and resource-rich countries.</p><p>This topic review will outline the pathogenesis and main causes of non-CF related bronchiectasis in children. The evaluation and management of non-CF bronchiectasis in children, and the causes of bronchiectasis in adults are discussed in separate topic reviews.

Use of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) will detect milder disease, and result in higher prevalence estimates than strategies employing less sensitive forms of radiography. Therefore the precise burden of bronchiectasis is hard to quantify.</p><p>The estimated prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis in children in most resource-rich countries is low, probably because of improvements in sanitation and housing, immunizations against respiratory illnesses (eg, measles and pertussis), and antibiotic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Reported national incidence of bronchiectasis in children aged 0 to 14 years ranges from 0.5 per 100,000 child-years in Finland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] to 3.7 per 100,000 child-years in New Zealand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a study from the United States, non-CF bronchiectasis was diagnosed in 4.2 per 100,000 young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Some indigenous populations, including natives of Polynesia, Alaska, Australia, and New Zealand, have prevalence rates of as high as 15 per 1000 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. The relatively high rates of non-CF bronchiectasis in these populations has been attributed to environmental conditions such as overcrowding, poor hygiene, and limited access to health care that are associated with recurrent respiratory infections during childhood, or in some cases to heritable defects in immunity or pulmonary clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/6,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchiectasis is the outcome of complex interaction between host, pathologic process, and environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Animal models of bronchiectasis suggest that obstruction, inadequate mucus clearance, and infection are necessary prerequisites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Exposure to pathogens results in an inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil influx and cytokine (inflammatory mediator) release. As examples, proinflammatory mediators (eg, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukins 1B and 8) are elevated in the sputum of children with both cystic fibrosis (CF)-related and non-CF related bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Molecular mechanisms that contribute to airway damage in bronchiectasis are discussed in a separate topic review (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>). Inflammation also results in impaired mucociliary clearance, which in turn leads to increased bacterial colonization and infection.</p><p>The continued cycle of infection, inflammation, and airway injury with impaired mucociliary clearance results in loss of the airway muscular and elastic components with dilation and distortion of the airways and increased sputum production. The airways become collapsible, limiting airflow, especially with forced expiration. The lung parenchyma is often involved, developing areas of atelectasis, emphysema, and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>]. In addition, there is marked hypertrophy of the bronchial vasculature, which is prone to rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The classic Reid classification divides bronchiectasis into three different patterns, based on gross histological appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cylindrical bronchiectasis, mildly uniform airway dilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Varicose bronchiectasis, focally dilated areas between narrowed segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saccular bronchiectasis, balloon-like airway dilation with more disruption of lung parenchyma</p><p/><p>The correlation of these patterns with clinical status, etiology, or pathophysiology is not well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, studies using high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan suggest that bronchiectasis may be a dynamic process, and that cylindrical bronchiectasis can be reversible if the underlying cause is successfully treated (eg, patients with atelectasis, infection, or a retained foreign body) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p>In many other cases, bronchiectatic changes appear to be irreversible. Indeed, some authors propose that the term bronchiectasis be defined as the irreversible dilation of the cartilage-containing airways or bronchi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;traction bronchiectasis&quot; is used to describe the radiological finding of airway widening without surrounding thickening or damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70396\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70396 \">image 1</a>). This usually is caused by other lung disease, such as interstitial fibrosis, which causes traction on the airway so that it is widened, simulating bronchiectasis. No clinical symptoms are attributed to this finding, although respiratory symptoms related to the underlying disease may be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Distribution'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of underlying disease processes can cause bronchiectasis; the cause should be determined whenever possible because this may direct treatment. However, in more than one-third of pediatric cases, an underlying cause could not be identified despite a thorough evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As an example, a systematic review of 12 studies with 989 children identified an underlying cause for bronchiectasis in 63 percent of the cases. The most commonly identified causes were previous pneumonia (19 percent), primary immunodeficiency (17 percent), recurrent aspiration, including an inhaled foreign body (10 percent), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Persistent bacterial bronchitis is a newly recognized entity that may account for some of the cases of bronchiectasis in which an underlying cause cannot be determined. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below.)</p><p>The causes of bronchiectasis can be categorized by whether the distribution is localized (focal) or generalized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71732 \">table 1</a>).

Because the bronchial cartilage is absent or deficient, the segmental and subsegmental bronchi are dilated and collapse easily. Children typically present before three years of age with cough, wheezing, and recurrent febrile illness. Based on the few cases reported in the literature, the prognosis is variable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital tracheobronchomegaly (Mounier-Kuhn syndrome) is a congenital disorder that is characterized by markedly dilated trachea and main bronchi, resulting in dynamic dilation and collapse during inspiration and exhalation. On pathologic examination, there is atrophy or absence of elastic tissue, and thinning of the muscular components of the airway. Outpouching of redundant mucosal tissue results in pooling of secretions and recurrent infection, leading to bronchiectasis. The clinical manifestations range from minimal disease to respiratory failure and death.
