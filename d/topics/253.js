It is an emergency that needs to be treated quickly.</p><p>A &quot;compartment&quot; is a group of muscles. Each muscle compartment in the body is surrounded by a strong band of tissue, called &quot;fascia.&quot; In ACS, too much pressure builds up in a muscle compartment. This is usually caused by bleeding or a collection of fluid. The abnormal build-up of pressure damages the muscles and causes symptoms. ACS happens quickly, usually over a few hours. (The word &quot;acute&quot; means that something happens quickly.)</p><p>ACS most commonly happens in the forearm or lower leg (calf). But it can also happen in the foot, upper leg, or buttock.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10844191\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes acute compartment syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different things can cause ACS. Most often, it happens after an injury, such as a broken bone or severe burn. But it can also happen if a cast or bandage is put on too tight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10844326\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of acute compartment syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of ACS usually get worse quickly (over a few hours) and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain that is much worse than expected, given the injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A deep ache or burning pain that doesn't go away</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness, tingling, or loss of feeling</p><p/><p>If ACS isn't treated right away, it can cause other symptoms. These include muscle weakness or being unable to move certain muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10844206\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for acute compartment syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. Doctors usually do repeat exams over time to see if your symptoms change or get worse.</p><p>The only way your doctor can know for sure if you have ACS is to check the pressure in your muscle compartment. Doctors can use different devices to measure this pressure. But in general, this test involves putting a thin needle or tube into your muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10844221\"><span class=\"h1\">How is acute compartment syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment for ACS is a type of surgery called a &quot;fasciotomy.&quot; During this surgery, the doctor will cut open the fascia and muscles to relieve the abnormal build-up of pressure in the compartment.</p><p>After surgery, the doctor won't close the cut right away. Instead, he or she will leave the cut open and bandage it loosely. The doctor will do another surgery, usually a few days later, to close the cut.</p><p>If ACS isn't treated quickly enough, muscles can die. Then people might need surgery to remove the injured body part, called &quot;amputation.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10844236\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhabdomyolysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rhabdomyolysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-burns-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Skin burns (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-burns-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Skin burns (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
