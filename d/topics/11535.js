The natural history is variable, depending upon the etiology and the stage at which the disease is first diagnosed.</p><p>The major causes of MR are primary diseases of the valve apparatus and secondary (functional) MR due to cardiomyopathy or coronary disease. The causes of primary MR include mitral valve prolapse (MVP), rheumatic heart disease, infective endocarditis, and trauma, which can lead to a flail (or partial flail) mitral leaflet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation#H1671064963\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The best natural history data that are presently available have come from studies of patients with MVP and flail mitral leaflet, which is usually a consequence of degenerative mitral valve disease (eg, MVP). These findings may not apply to MR of other causes, especially ischemic and functional MR.</p><p>This topic will review the natural history of chronic primary MR caused by MVP and of flail mitral leaflet. The indications for surgery in chronic MR are discussed separately.

The natural history of MVP is generally benign, but serious complications do occur; the most common are infective endocarditis, cerebrovascular accidents, the need for mitral valve surgery, and death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonarrhythmic complications of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmic complications of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the 1970s, clinicians relied on the physical examination and phonocardiogram for the diagnosis of MVP. Reports from that era indicate that serious complications occurred at the rate of approximately 1 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In the 1980s, with increasing use of echocardiography, clinical investigators described higher complication rates of approximately 2 to 4 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. These patients, seen at tertiary referral centers, presumably had more serious disease. </p><p>Although leaflet thickness &gt;5 mm by M-mode echocardiography was associated with increased risk for complications in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>], a larger later series using 2D echocardiography found that leaflet thickness was not an independent predictor of mortality and valvular morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this community study of 833 patients diagnosed with asymptomatic MVP and followed longitudinally in the Olmsted County, cardiac mortality was best predicted by presence of MR and left ventricular dysfunction at the time of diagnosis, while risk factors for cardiac morbidity (defined as occurrence of heart failure, thromboembolic events, endocarditis, atrial fibrillation, and need for cardiac surgery) included age &ge;50 years, left atrial enlargement, MR, flail leaflet, and atrial fibrillation present at baseline echocardiography. </p><p>Our current understanding is that patients with MVP constitute a heterogeneous group in which risk factors for a widely varying prognosis can be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. This was best illustrated in a community-based retrospective review of the course of 833 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota who were first diagnosed with <strong>asymptomatic</strong> MVP between 1989 and 1998; the patients had little comorbidity or cardiovascular history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Another report from Olmsted County assessed the rate of development of AF in 89 patients with MVP (and grade 3 or 4 MR) and 360 with flail leaflets; all of the patients were in sinus rhythm at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The rate of development of AF was approximately 5 percent per year with both types of lesions; the major independent risk factors were age &ge;65 years and baseline left atrial dimension &ge;50 mm. The onset of AF was associated with increases in cardiac mortality and morbidity with medical management.</p><p>Another report evaluated the prevalence of AF in patients with MVP who were about to undergo mitral valve repair or valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In the community-based Olmsted County study cited above, moderate to severe MR was present in 16 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A similar rate of moderate to severe MR on echocardiography (23 percent) was noted in a much smaller series from the Framingham Heart Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The valvular lesion in MVP is characterized by thickening and degeneration of the leaflets and chordae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57557%7ECARD%2F76601\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef57557 graphicRef76601 \">movie 3A-B</a>). These changes reflect repeated damage to the valve leaflets, which deforms the valve, thereby preventing proper coaptation of the leaflets. The mitral annulus gradually dilates as regurgitation worsens. An increase in prolapse may further stretch and damage the chordae tendineae. Weakened chordae can rupture suddenly, producing a flail or partial flail mitral leaflet and severe MR.

Findings indicative of increased risk include greater magnitude of MR, flail leaflet, AF, and age &ge;50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/10,11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>The magnitude of MR (quantified as the regurgitant volume or regurgitant fraction) is an important determinant of prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The regurgitant volume is determined by the duration of regurgitation as well as the size of the regurgitant orifice and the magnitude of the systolic pressure gradient across the mitral valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In patients with MVP, the MR may be holosystolic or mid to late systolic and thus, the duration of MR is an important variable. Hence, the effective orifice area (EROA) is a key but not sole factor affecting regurgitant volume. This distinction is one explanation for why baseline EROA predicted outcome in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], but not in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, there are limitations and technical challenges associated with EROA measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>The predictive value of EROA was suggested by a prospective study of 456 patients with isolated primary MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Eighty percent had MVP, nine percent AF, the mean age was 63 years, the mean LVEF was 70 percent, and the mean duration of follow-up with medical therapy was 2.7 years. Clinical management proceeded according to each patient's treating physician. Cardiac surgery was eventually performed in 232 patients (51 percent) and was independently associated with increased survival (adjusted odds ratio 0.28). Quantitative grading of the severity of MR by measurement of the EROA was the most powerful predictor of outcome as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 198 patients (43 percent) with an EROA &ge;40 mm<sup>2</sup> (mean 64 mm<sup>2</sup>) had significantly higher rates of all-cause mortality (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 2.90), cardiac death (adjusted RR 5.21), and cardiac events (adjusted RR 5.66) compared with 129 patients with an EROA &lt;20 mm<sup>2</sup> (mean 11 mm<sup>2</sup>). The estimated rates of five-year overall mortality and cardiac mortality in the two groups were 42 versus 9 percent and 36 versus 3 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of note, the patients with an EROA &ge;40 mm<sup>2</sup> had higher regurgitant volumes (101 versus 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/beat</span> with an EROA &lt;20 mm<sup>2</sup>) as well as greater left atrial volumes, systolic pulmonary pressures, and were more likely to have MVP (98 versus 48 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality rates at five years were significantly higher than expected among medically treated patients with an EROA &ge;40 mm<sup>2</sup> (42 versus 22 percent) as well as in those with an EROA of 20 to 39 mm<sup>2</sup> (34 versus 16 percent).</p><p/><p>Thus, EROA was a strong predictor of outcomes in a population of patients in which larger EROA was associated with larger regurgitant volume. </p><p>A later study from the same center, evaluating the effect of duration of regurgitation in patients with MVP, found that the regurgitant volume but not EROA was a predictor of clinical outcomes (mortality, cardiac events [cardiac mortality including sudden death, heart failure, new onset atrial fibrillation], and need for mitral valve surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The study compared 111 patients with mid to late systolic MR and 90 with holosystolic MR matched for age, gender, AF, ejection fraction and EROA. Mean regurgitant volume was substantially lower in the group with mid to late systolic MR (25 versus 49 mL), despite similar color jet areas and peak MR velocities. The combined event of death or need for surgery occurred more frequently in patients with holosystolic MR than in those with mid-late systolic MR (24 versus 6 percent at one year and 44 versus 31 percent at five years).

A less common cause is rupture of a papillary muscle in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction. Depending upon the rate and extent of chordae or papillary muscle rupture, flail mitral leaflet may result in acute, subacute or chronic MR. The course of acute MR is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mitral regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of flail or partial flail mitral leaflet is based upon echocardiographic evidence of a failure of leaflet coaptation with rapid systolic movement of the involved leaflet into the left atrium. In most cases, only a portion of the leaflet is disrupted and the appropriate descriptive term is &quot;partial flail leaflet&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60709\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef60709 \">movie 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64363\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64363 \">movie 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61846\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef61846 \">movie 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77752\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77752 \">movie 7</a>). Serious MR is usually present, as the regurgitant leak and the left ventricular (and left atrial) volume overload are more severe than in the vast majority of patients with uncomplicated MVP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the mitral valve&quot;, section on 'Flail mitral valve'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MR may progress more rapidly in the presence of a flail leaflet than among other patients with MVP. In the study cited above of 64 patients with MVP, 10 of whom developed a new flail leaflet, there was a significantly greater rate of progression of MR in the patients with flail leaflet compared with those with stable MVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the above cited study of 132 asymptomatic patients with severe degenerative MR, the 58 patients with flail leaflet tended to develop criteria for surgery slightly but not significantly earlier than those with MVP without flail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A retrospective report evaluated the long-term (5 to 15 years) outcomes of 229 patients with flail mitral valve leaflet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Corrective surgery was performed in 62 percent while the remainder received medical therapy. The main indication for surgery was serious dyspnea (107 patients); other indications included physician preference, endocarditis, angina, and thromboembolism.</p><p>Within 10 years of the diagnosis, the following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ninety percent of the patients had undergone surgery or died; risk factors for decreased survival were New York Heart Association class III or IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;60 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73457\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73457 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those treated medically, the rate of cardiac mortality was 21 percent at five years and 33 percent at 10 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multivariate analysis, mortality was markedly reduced by surgery (hazard ratio [HR] 0.29, 95% CI 0.15-0.56).</p><p/><p>A follow-up review from the same authors compared the outcomes of 63 patients who had early surgery and 158 patients who were treated conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Early surgery was associated with a higher rate of overall survival at 10 years (79 versus 65 percent) and a lower incidence of cardiovascular death (8 versus 29 percent), heart failure (27 versus 59 percent), and new chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) (4 versus 26 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72108\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72108 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Later series have reported lower rates of adverse cardiac events in patients with flail leaflet, which may be due to earlier corrective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation-caused-by-mitral-valve-prolapse-and-flail-mitral-leaflet/abstract/28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30</a>].
