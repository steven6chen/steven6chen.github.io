Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is currently the preferred mode of noninvasive ventilation. Other modes that long antedated NPPV are used occasionally, including negative pressure ventilators and abdominal displacement ventilators. Diaphragm pacers and glossopharyngeal breathing are still used for special applications.</p><p>This topic will discuss the different forms of noninvasive ventilation that are used for neuromuscular and chest wall disease, emphasizing the use of NPPV. The types and applications of noninvasive ventilatory support are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71141\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71141 \">table 1</a>). Practical aspects of implementing noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support and daytime noninvasive ventilatory assistance are discussed separately.

This ascendancy has been related to ease of application, portability, demonstrated efficacy, and the ability to eliminate obstructive sleep apneas that may be induced or potentiated by other noninvasive ventilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. NPPV requires an interface (ie, a mask or other device that directs airflow into the upper airway) and a positive pressure ventilator. In contrast to ventilation via an invasive airway, NPPV uses an open breathing circuit, is inherently leaky, and depends upon patient cooperation to achieve ventilatory assistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Interfaces</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four types of interfaces are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal masks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52499\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52499 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75445\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75445 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oronasal masks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76935\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76935 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68361\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68361 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91182\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91182 \">picture 5</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mouthpieces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60750\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60750 \">picture 6</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helmet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F108315\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108315 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p>Nasal masks are the most popular interface for chronic administration of NPPV in patients with neuromuscular disease or chest wall deformity. They provide greater patient comfort and better preservation of speech and swallowing than do other interfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nasal masks</strong> &ndash; Several types of nasal masks are commonly used:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Standard nasal masks are clear plastic dome-shaped devices that fit over the entire nose and have a soft rubber or silicone cuff to maintain an air seal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52499\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52499 \">picture 1</a>). Numerous manufacturers supply standard nasal masks in a variety of sizes, including pediatric sizes. Most patients successfully adapt to standard masks, but some are uncomfortable because of poor fit or excessive mask pressure on the skin that occasionally leads to nasal bridge ulcerations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Several types of &quot;gel masks&quot; that use a soft gel or foam in the sealing gasket or &quot;minimasks&quot; that seal only over the surface of the nose may enhance tolerance in patients having trouble adapting to standard nasal masks. Chin straps help to reduce small mouth leaks, but the resulting seal is usually not as effective as with an oronasal mask in patients with mouth leaks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nasal &quot;pillows&quot; or &quot;seals&quot; consist of soft rubber cones that are inserted directly into the nostrils, thus exerting no pressure on the nasal bridge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75445\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75445 \">picture 2</a>). If skin integrity becomes a problem, it may be helpful to alternate between types of interfaces (if both seal well) in order to decrease irritation at any one site. If the nostrils become irritated at the contact site with the nasal pillows, a thin layer of a water-based saline gel can be applied around the nasal pillow edge that contacts the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oronasal (or full face)</strong> &ndash; Oronasal (or full face) masks are the interface most often used to administer NPPV to patients with acute respiratory failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91182\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91182 \">picture 5</a>). They are less well tolerated than nasal masks for therapy of chronic respiratory failure, because they cover both the nose and mouth and interfere with speech and swallowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, they may be better tolerated than nasal masks in some patients, and warrant a trial in those having difficulty achieving success with nasal masks, particularly if there are large mouth leaks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, total face masks that cover the entire face with the upper border going across the forehead and the lower border between the chin and lower lip will spare the bridge of the nose and allow mouth breathing. They may also allow vocalization to a greater degree than standard oronasal masks. Although the straps are secured by easy-to-remove clips, both the total and oronasal masks should be used with caution during nocturnal use in patients with neuromuscular disease and limited use of their upper extremities. Adequate alarms and other safeguards should be in place because of the patient's inability to remove the masks in the case of vomiting, secretion buildup, or power failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mouthpiece</strong> &ndash; Mouthpiece ventilation has been used for decades at certain centers to successfully support patients with respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease, even those who require almost continuous ventilatory support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Mounting the ventilator on a wheelchair and suspending the mouthpiece on a gooseneck stand allows the patient to remain mobile and simultaneously have access to positive pressure as needed (also called sip and puff ventilation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Helmet</strong> &ndash; The helmet is a transparent hood that covers the entire head and face, the base of which is linked to a soft collar that seals the helmet around the neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F108315\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108315 \">figure 1</a>). It has been proposed as an alternative to a conventional full face mask for NPPV in patients with <strong>acute</strong> hypoxemic respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. However, it should not be used in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure from neuromuscular or chest wall diseases due to the risk of carbon dioxide rebreathing, a phenomenon thought to be due to poor gas flow inside the helmet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Additionally, it has been shown to be less effective in unloading inspiratory muscles compared with a standard face mask [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and it can cause delays with ventilator triggering and cycling. Helmet-delivered NIV remains investigational and it is not yet commercially available in the United States. Data describing its potential efficacy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Invasive versus noninvasive'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either volume- or pressure-limited ventilators may be used to deliver NPPV. While in the past nasal NPPV most often comprised of portable <strong>volume-limited</strong> ventilators, portable <strong>pressure-limited</strong> ventilators, sometimes referred to as bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) ventilators, are now used more often (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65408\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65408 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73882\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73882 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. These pressure-limited ventilators provide ventilatory modes that resemble pressure support ventilation on critical care ventilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. They have sensitive flow triggers for cycling between inspiratory and expiratory pressures, matching patient breathing efforts closely; most also provide a time-cycled backup mode.</p><p>Portable pressure-limited ventilators have gained popularity for administration of home NPPV because of lower cost, greater portability, and often greater comfort compared to volume-limited ventilators. They are now used in the vast majority of applications. These devices lack sophisticated alarms or internal batteries and are best suited for patients requiring nocturnal assistance only, but can be used to provide continuous (day and night) ventilator support if needed. If so, they should be equipped with alarms to detect loss of function. </p><p>Another potential advantage of pressure-limited ventilation is its ability to maintain inspiratory airflow on a breath-by-breath basis to compensate for air leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, volume-limited ventilators are not able to make breath-to-breath adjustments; in order to compensate for air-leaks, tidal volume must be increased. However, the presence of large air leaks may also impair the ability of pressure-limited ventilators to sense patient inspiratory or expiratory flows, leading to asynchrony. The use of a back-up rate that approximates the patient's spontaneous breathing rate assures ventilator inspiratory triggering during large leaks, and all ventilators have a mechanism to terminate inspiration, either based on I:E ratio or a maximal inspiratory time.</p><p>Many manufacturers of critical care ventilators have added &quot;noninvasive ventilation&quot; (NIV) modes as an option to render them more tolerant of air leaks, better at synchronizing with patients and less apt to trigger &quot;nuisance&quot; alarms than traditional modes on these ventilators. However, most NIV modes have not been fully tested in clinical situations, and many require additional adjustments to compensate adequately for large air leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>More recently, manufacturers have introduced blower-based hybrid ventilators designed for multiple applications both in the home as well as inpatient settings such as long-term acute care centers. These can deliver both volume-limited and pressure-limited modes as well as mouthpiece ventilation, have sophisticated alarm systems, and are suitable for either invasive or noninvasive applications. They have internal batteries in the event of power failure and are suitable for use in patients with high levels of ventilator dependency (up to 24 hours daily), which standard BPAP devices lacking internal batteries or sophisticated alarms are not. </p><p>Studies that have directly compared pressure- and volume-limited ventilators have found similar efficacies in terms of supporting gas exchange and patient adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In terms of patient satisfaction, volume-limited ventilators may induce more gastrointestinal side effects, whereas pressure-limited ventilators are generally perceived by patients as being more comfortable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/1,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,26</a>].</p><p>Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) is a newer ventilatory mode that has the capability of making within-breath adjustments in flow delivery and generating an inspiratory pressure that is proportional to patient effort. Theoretically, it can synchronize better with patient respirations and enhance comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, evidence on its superiority to pressure support is conflicting, particularly in patients with neuromuscular disease. One randomized study of 44 patients with acute respiratory failure found greater comfort with PAV than pressure support ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a series of 15 patients with chronic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease, PAV resulted in less reduction of work of breathing and less comfort than pressure support ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This latter finding illustrates a shortcoming of PAV; when neuromechanical uncoupling (eg, due to neuromuscular disease) limits the patient's ability to generate inspiratory flow, PAV may not provide adequate ventilatory assistance.</p><p>Other newer modes such as average volume assured pressure support (AVAPS) and intelligent volume assured pressure support (iVAPS) have been used to provide noninvasive ventilation as well. AVAPS targets an average minute volume determined by setting a target tidal volume and backup rate and iVAPS targets &quot;alveolar&quot; volume by subtracting out estimated anatomic dead space volume, but both have algorithms that adjust inspiratory pressure to assure the target volumes are met. A small single blind, randomized prospective study revealed that AVAPs was comparable to pressure support ventilation in terms of effects on sleep, but minute ventilation was slightly greater with AVAPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. AVAPS may also lower the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) more rapidly than standard BPAP in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], but superiority in outcomes assessing subjective or functional responses, health care utilization, or survival has not been shown. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">NEGATIVE PRESSURE VENTILATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Devices for negative pressure ventilation like the iron lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61051\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61051 \">picture 8</a>) or chest cuirass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81452\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81452 \">picture 9</a>) work by producing an intermittent negative pressure around the thorax and abdomen. The negative pressure is transmitted across the chest wall and diaphragm thereby assisting inhalation and lung inflation. When the perithoracic pressure returns to atmospheric (or positive in some devices), passive elastic recoil then deflates the lungs. Negative pressure ventilators have several disadvantages compared to NPPV (eg, less portable, harder to apply, and apt to exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]). Consequently, they are seldom used today and are of mainly historical interest. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ABDOMINAL RESPIRATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal respirators use motion of the abdominal viscera to augment diaphragm excursion. Examples include the intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator (&quot;pneumobelt&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65937\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65937 \">picture 10</a>) and the rocking bed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65219\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65219 \">picture 11</a>). Both the rocking bed and pneumobelt were useful in patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. However, the relative ineffectiveness of both devices in patients with acute illness or abnormal body habitus limits their use. Once again, these have been replaced by NPPV for the most part, and are mainly of historical interest. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAPHRAGM PACERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diaphragmatic pacing can be used in patients with apnea or severe hypoventilation due to bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. </p><p>Phrenic nerve pacing can only be performed in patients with intact phrenic nerve function. Patients with denervated diaphragms cannot be paced. Patients with diaphragmatic paralysis due to high level cervical cord injury are the best candidates for diaphragmatic pacing. Preliminary evidence also suggests that some patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be paced using residual functioning branches of the phrenic nerve at the level of the diaphragm. The major goal of pacing in these populations is to reduce the time spent on mechanical ventilation or to delay the need for prolonged ventilatory support. </p><p>The selection of suitable candidates, evaluation, implantation, and complications, of diaphragmatic pacing are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pacing the diaphragm: Patient selection, evaluation, implantation, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOSSOPHARYNGEAL BREATHING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glossopharyngeal (GPB) or &quot;frog breathing&quot; is a technique learned spontaneously by or taught to patients with respiratory insufficiency due to respiratory muscle weakness or paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The main users of glossopharyngeal breathing currently are post-polio patients, those with high cervical cord lesions, and others with neuromuscular diseases that spare the upper airway musculature.</p><p>Some patients use GPB to become independent from mechanical ventilation for up to several hours at a time while awake. Others may use GPB to delay the need for mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The upper airway and tongue musculature must be intact, as they are used for gulping maneuvers to inject 50 to 60 mL boluses of air into the lungs. Each &quot;gulp&quot; takes 0.5 seconds and is repeated 10 to 12 times to achieve a normal tidal volume. The intake of tidal volume is repeated 10 times per minute for a total volume of 5 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>.</p><p>The technique can also be used to improve cough efficacy; repetitive gulps achieve an inspired volume of up to 2 to 2.5 L, in order to increase expiratory flows and assist with coughing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPIRATORY AIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with pulmonary restriction due to neuromuscular disease or chest wall deformity often have low expiratory airflow because of both reduced inspiratory capacity and weakness of expiratory muscles. As a result, these individuals are unable to cough effectively and clear airway secretions, making them susceptible to respiratory failure following a respiratory infection. Maneuvers and devices that augment expiratory flow should be used to help clear secretions, avoiding the need for hospitalization and intubation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71141\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71141 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Manually assisted coughing (also known as &quot;quad&quot; coughing) is a useful technique to augment cough efficiency and secretion clearance. It consists of an abdominal thrust applied firmly but gently to the mid-epigastrium in time with a cough. Resembling a Heimlich maneuver, this technique is used in acute care hospitals for patients with weakened cough muscles and taught to family members and aides of patients at home with severe restrictive disease, to be used whenever the patient needs help in clearing secretions.</p><p>A number of mechanical devices can also be used to enhance cough and secretion removal, including the cough in-exsufflator, high frequency intrapulmonary air pulses, and the high frequency chest wall oscillator (HFCWO). These devices work by different mechanisms, and limited evidence suggests that each may be beneficial in the proper setting. In a brief, uncontrolled trial in 17 patients with neuromuscular disease, the cough in-exsufflator improved physiologic parameters including exhaled tidal volume and peak expiratory flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Another study showed a very low hospitalization rate among patients with neuromuscular disease treated with a regimen using a combination of inspiratory assist devices, quad coughing, and the cough in-exsufflator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A 12 week, controlled trial of HFCWO in 46 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis showed reduced breathlessness, but no slowing of deterioration in pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Ventilators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with more severe respiratory insufficiency who require daytime in addition to nighttime ventilatory support, either pressure or volume cycled ventilators can be used. &quot;Hybrid&quot; ventilators that include internal batteries, sophisticated monitoring, and alarm systems are being increasingly used. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Ventilators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices for negative pressure ventilation produce an intermittent negative pressure around the thorax and abdomen. The negative pressure is transmitted across the chest wall and diaphragm thereby assisting inhalation and lung inflation. Abdominal respirators (eg, pneumobelt and rocking bed) use motion of the abdominal viscera to augment diaphragm excursion. Both types of ventilators have disadvantages relative to NPPV; they are less portable, harder to apply, and are mainly of historical interest. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Negative pressure ventilators'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal respirators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with impaired cough due to limited inspiratory capacity, weak cough muscles or thick inspissated secretions, implementation of a pulmonary hygiene program with cough assist maneuvers should be performed. These may consist of manually assisted cough, the mechanical in-exsufflator, the chest wall oscillator, or a combination. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Expiratory aids'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diaphragmatic pacing can be used in patients with apnea or severe hypoventilation due to bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Phrenic nerve pacing is used mainly in patients with upper level cervical spinal cord injury, whereas direct pacing of the phrenic nerve at the level of the diaphragm can be used in rare but select patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The major aim of diaphragmatic pacing is to reduce the time spent on mechanical ventilation or to delay the need for prolonged ventilatory support. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diaphragm pacers'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pacing the diaphragm: Patient selection, evaluation, implantation, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24956033\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Dr. Robert Basner, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hill NS, Redline S, Carskadon MA, et al.
