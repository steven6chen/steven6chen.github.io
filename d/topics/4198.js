Sensorimotor symptoms may include leg weakness, decreased or increased muscle tone, or sensory deficits of the legs and perineal area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/13,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,17</a>]. In some cases, sensory loss can lead to atrophic ulceration of the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2828583\"><span class=\"h3\">Tethered cord syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tethered cord syndrome is caused by a stretch-induced dysfunction of the caudal spinal cord and conus. It can be a presentation of several forms of CSD, including spinal lipomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63551\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63551 \">image 2</a>), tight filum terminale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75372\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75372 \">image 3</a>), split cord malformations, and the caudal regression syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The constellation of symptoms variably associated with the tethered cord syndrome includes back pain, bladder dysfunction, leg weakness, calf muscle atrophy, diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes, and dermatomal sensory loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Orthopedic signs include progressive scoliosis and various foot deformities. The pathogenesis of tethered cord syndrome is reviewed elsewhere.

Older children and adolescents are more likely to complain of pain in the lumbosacral region, perineum, and legs. The tethered cord syndrome causes spinal dysfunction caudal to the <span class=\"nowrap\">T12/L1</span> spinal level, and does not explain upper motor neuron signs. Therefore, patients should be evaluated for more proximal cord lesions if upper motor neuron signs (eg, spasticity or hyperreflexia) are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. &#160; </p><p>In the classic progression of symptoms with tethered cord syndrome, children begin to stumble after they have learned to walk normally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Then they start dribbling urine after having achieved successful toilet training. Later, they develop musculoskeletal signs and symptoms; common findings include foot drop, painless sores, and scoliosis. Older children will often complain of back pain exacerbated by exercise, while younger children tend to have increased irritability and refuse to perform certain activities and movements, though without a frank complaint of pain.</p><p>Back pain, leg pain, and scoliosis are the primary symptoms of tethered cord syndrome in adults, and these may be difficult to distinguish from other more common causes of chronic back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The earliest sign of motor dysfunction in the older child and adult with tethered cord syndrome is usually weakness of ankle dorsiflexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Sensory symptoms usually are patchy and vague, especially when related to tethered cord syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2828298\"><span class=\"h2\">Urologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Closed spinal dysraphism is sometimes associated with neurogenic bladder dysfunction or urogenital malformations. However, the true prevalence of urologic involvement with CSD is unknown, and the diagnosis of bladder dysfunction is often delayed, particularly for pretoilet trained children. The problems are illustrated by the findings from a tertiary center that reported a series of 51 children with CSD, ages 6 months to 10 years (mean age 3 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

We suggest MRI of the spine for neurologically asymptomatic infants and children who have an isolated midline cutaneous lumbosacral spine lesion that is potentially high-risk for the development of CSD. These cutaneous lesions include atypical dimples (those &gt;5 mm in size or located &gt;2.5 cm from the anus), hemangiomas, cutis aplasia, and upraised lesions (ie, masses, tails, and hairy patches).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4725346\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation for CSD starts with a thorough history and examination.

In addition, some will have fluctuating symptoms, which makes their diagnosis even more challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Such cases highlight the importance of objective signs suggesting CSD, particularly midline cutaneous lesions over the lumbosacral spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76756\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76756 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/13,15,17,23,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,17,23,33</a>]. Since these cutaneous lesions are the most obvious marker of CSD, it is understandable that they are less prevalent or obvious in patients who present in adolescence or adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In most studies, which are largely retrospective, the presence of two or more congenital midline skin lesions implies a higher risk of associated CSD than an isolated cutaneous lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. As an example, in a large series of congenital lumbosacral lipomas, the frequency of dysraphic states in patients with an isolated cutaneous lesion was low (eg, none of 14 patients with an isolated cutaneous angioma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Whether all isolated cutaneous lesions require further evaluation for CSD in neurologically asymptomatic neonates and children is controversial.

These include atypical dimples, particularly those that are large (&gt;5 mm) or located &gt;2.5 cm above the anus, hemangiomas, cutis aplasia, and upraised lesions (ie, masses, tails, and hairy patches) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In the clinical experience of some experts, hemangiomas of infancy (vascular tumors) have a higher risk of CSD compared with midline capillary malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>The finding of a dimple associated with deviation of the intergluteal cleft should raise suspicion for a low-lying coccygeal lipoma not detected by palpation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,39</a>]. One prospective series obtained spinal MRI for children less than two years of age (mean age four months) with sacrococcygeal dimples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Among 47 cases with dimples located at the upper edge of a deviated (ie, curved or deformed) gluteal crease, a spinal deformity of CSD was present on MRI in 45 percent. A high rate of CSD (50 percent) was found also among 16 children with dimples located above the gluteal crease, which were sometimes associated with skin pigmentation or a duplicated gluteal crease. Even among 65 children with dimples located within a straight gluteal crease, CSD was present in 17 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72372515\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroimaging is an essential part of the evaluation for CSD.

The finding of an anatomically low conus medullaris may be the only sign of occult tethered cord syndrome. While some reports indicate that the tethered cord syndrome can occur even in cases where the conus appears at a normal spinal cord level on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>], there is no universally accepted definition or diagnostic criteria for tethered cord syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Plain radiographs are useful for detecting vertebral defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In some cases, prenatal ultrasonography of the spine can identify spinal anomalies if they are large enough, but this modality is not always accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>]. The sensitivity of spinal ultrasound, even when performed before the age of four months (ie, prior to ossification of the posterior elements of the spine), is suboptimal for the detection of CSD in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72372521\"><span class=\"h2\">Urodynamics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urodynamic testing can detect preclinical urologic dysfunction in children with CSD.

In a retrospective study of 123 children with cutaneous stigmata of CSD, abnormal urodynamic studies were present in 23 (19 percent).

Early neurosurgical intervention also is warranted for severe neonatal symptoms such as bowel obstruction. Additional indications for neurosurgical intervention include cases where the spinal cord is internally exposed, such as with intrasacral meningocele, to decrease the risk of infection and meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,32,33</a>], and patients who need vertebral stabilization or pain relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15,30,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,30,32,33</a>].

One series reported that such patients did not improve even when operated in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>More controversial indications for surgical intervention include radiographic demonstration of a tethered cord (ie, conus medullaris lower than the <span class=\"nowrap\">L2/L3</span> intervertebral disc) in asymptomatic patients, or abnormal findings on urodynamic studies in a patient with CSD. The rationale for surgery in such cases is that even infants and children who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic may go on to develop progressive and irreversible neurologic deficits. Therefore, we suggest that all children with radiologically confirmed spinal dysraphism be referred for neurosurgical evaluation, especially if there is cord tethering, which untreated can lead to progressive neurologic deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Conservative management with watchful monitoring is also an acceptable approach in patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, given the highly variable natural history of CSD.

In addition, some data suggest that fashioning a large intradural compartment, with duraplasty if needed, is associated with a reduced risk of developing arachnoid adhesions and cord retethering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Potential complications of surgery for CSD include cerebrospinal fluid leaks, wound infection, meningitis, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and neurologic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Patients who have surgery for CSD should remain under close monitoring because of the risk of future worsening, which can occur with spinal cord retethering or progression of a preexisting syrinx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The earliest indication of retethering is usually urologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, non-neurological symptoms may continue to progress postoperatively, as can be seen with preexisting scoliosis and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/16,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22</a>].</p><p>Urodynamics are generally considered to be a good monitoring tool for both nonoperative patients and postoperative patients, and particularly for early detection of cord retethering.

While nearly all of the patients lacked preoperative urological symptoms, most (11) had abnormal preoperative urodynamic findings.

With watchful observation and conservative management, some patients remain stable for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], spontaneously improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], or have radiologic regression of spinal lipomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. While some reports suggest that neurologic deterioration occurs in up to 75 percent of patients with tethered cord syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], others have found a much lower rate. As an example, one retrospective study reported 53 children with asymptomatic lipomas of the conus who were monitored during conservative management.

These data suggest that neurosurgery for CSD, most often release of a tethered cord, is associated with some degree of improvement in 33 to 90 percent of patients, and complete resolution of symptoms in occasional cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/7,15,28,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15,28,50-53</a>].

The inconsistency in reported outcomes is likely related to substantial differences among surgical studies with regard to types of patients (eg, children or adults with a range of spinal anomalies and symptoms), neurosurgical techniques, outcome assessments, and multiple other uncontrolled variables. Some studies suggest that patients with recent onset of symptoms tend to have a more complete resolution while those with long-standing symptoms tend to are less likely to exhibit meaningful improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>].</p><p>Patients who undergo surgery for tethered cord need continued follow-up (see <a href=\"#H80382500\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above) because of the risk of postsurgical retethering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closed-spinal-dysraphism-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,17</a>].
