After age 11, girls accrue approximately 12 percent of their adult stature and 36 percent of adult weight, and boys approximately 20 percent of their adult stature and 50 percent of adult weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Growth during adolescence is accompanied by an increased proportion of body fat for girls and an increased proportion of lean body mass and blood volume in boys. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The recommended dietary energy requirements in adolescents are defined to maintain health, promote optimal growth and maturation, and support a desirable level of physical activity. Dietary energy recommendations must be accompanied by strong encouragement for physical activity compatible with health, prevention of obesity, and adequate social and psychologic development.</p><p>The recommended dietary energy requirements in adolescents are reviewed here. Dietary requirements for other nutrients in adolescents are discussed separately.

It is measured under standard conditions of thermoneutrality, immobility, and fasting. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) relative to weight increases from birth to two years and then gradually declines through adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76918\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76918 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The effect of age on BMR is a function of changes in body composition through childhood and adolescence. BMR is strongly correlated with the fat free mass that comprises the bulk of the active metabolic tissue. The marked sex differences in intensity and duration of the adolescent growth spurt and in the proportion of fat free mass dictate the energy and nutrient needs of boys and girls. The World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed the Schofield equations for the estimation of BMR that take into account sex, age, and body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>For males, 10 to 18 years of age</strong>:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">BMR <span class=\"nowrap\">(MJ/day)</span> = (0.074 x body weight [kg]) + 2.754<br/><br/>BMR <span class=\"nowrap\">(kcal/day)</span> = (17.69 x body weight [kg]) + 658</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>For females, 10 to 18 years of age:</strong></p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">BMR <span class=\"nowrap\">(MJ/day)</span> = (0.056 x body weight [kg]) + 2.898<br/><br/>BMR <span class=\"nowrap\">(kcal/day)</span> = (13.38 x body weight [kg]) + 693</p></div></div><p/><p>Of note, adding a height factor does not significantly improve the performance of these prediction equations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. A meta-analysis reported that age, height, and body weight explained most of the variance in BMR (r<sup>2</sup> = 86.4 percent for males and 83.9 percent for females) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].Fat free mass and BMI did not account for a significant portion of the variance.</p><p>Several studies have evaluated the accuracy of these equations in adolescents, and whether they have universal application remains unclear. Measured BMR values coincided with predicted values in boys and girls 7 to 16 years of age in Holland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The equations overestimated BMR of boys in Colombia by 5 percent, teenage girls in China by 9 percent, and black girls in the United States by 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Further studies are needed to determine whether specific equations are necessary for different populations. Such an equation has been proposed for obese children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is closely related to BMR, and the terms are often used interchangeably. However, BMR is measured under carefully controlled conditions to ensure that the sympathetic nervous system is not activated, whereas RMR reflects measurements performed at rest but under less carefully controlled conditions. BMR is measured after a 12 to 14 hour overnight fast, with the subject resting comfortably, supine, awake, and motionless in a thermoneutral environment. RMR is measured two hours after eating with the subject resting comfortably, supine, awake, and motionless in a thermoneutral environment. RMR is approximately 10 percent greater than BMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ENERGY COST OF GROWTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The energy cost of growth is the energy deposited in newly accrued tissues, and the energy expended for tissue synthesis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Energy deposition depends upon the composition of the newly accrued tissues.

Estimates have been published for male and female reference adolescents that are based upon total body water, total body potassium, and total body calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These estimates reveal significant differences in the energy cost of growth in males as compared with females:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On average, fat free mass increases dramatically in boys from approximately 28 kg at 10.5 years to 61 kg at 18.5 years, with peak deposition coinciding with peak height velocity.

The patterns of physical activities among adolescents vary across societies. As an example, a review of a number of time allocation studies indicated that, in comparison to children in industrialized areas, children in developing rural areas sleep less at night, participate longer in moderate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heavy physical activities, and, therefore, have greater energy expenditures in relation to their BMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Energy cost of physical activity</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Measurement techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Habitual physical activity and its impact on the energy needs of adolescents may be assessed by the doubly labeled water method, heart rate monitoring, and accelerometry.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The doubly labeled water method is a noninvasive technique that uses the stable isotopes deuterium and oxygen-18 to estimate total energy expenditure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. It encompasses BMR, thermoregulation, the synthetic cost of growth, and physical activity. It is accurate but requires sophisticated instrumentation and is expensive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring heart rate, calibrated against indirect calorimetry, can be used to estimate energy expenditure because a linear relationship exists between heart rate and oxygen consumption during exercise. Monitoring heart rate provides a noninvasive and inexpensive alternative to calorimetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerometers are small, lightweight, portable, noninvasive, nonintrusive devices that record motion in one or more planes and provide an indication of the frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Validity studies have yielded moderate to strong correlations between accelerometer counts and oxygen consumption, activity energy expenditure, or metabolic equivalents (METs) in adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Accelerometers and heart monitors have been combined to improve the accuracy and precision with which energy expenditure can be predicted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In general, the combined accelerometer and heart rate monitor method has better accuracy and precision than either method alone.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Energy equivalents of physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The energy costs of some recreational activities as measured in adolescents are shown in the table as multiples of the resting metabolic rate (RMR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52989 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Energy costs range from 1.1 times RMR for homework or reading to 8.2 times RMR while running. The energy cost estimates of activities often are derived from adult measurements that may not be valid for children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, energy cost is affected by age, size, level of training, ethnic background, and the presence or absence of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/8,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,24</a>].</p><p>In kinesiology, METs are widely used to express the energy costs of physical activity as multiples of RMR. By convention, 1 MET is defined as an oxygen uptake of 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min,</span> or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/h</span> in adults, a value derived for a 70 kg man aged 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The conventional MET value is not applicable to children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>]. Instead, measured or predicted RMR values should be used to appropriately adjust for individual differences in body size by expressing total energy expenditure as a multiple of RMR.</p><p>The Compendium of Physical Activities is a coding scheme developed in adults that classifies specific physical activities by MET equivalents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In children 8 to 18 years of age, age- and puberty-adjusted metabolic equivalents were estimated and found to be generally lower than the adult compendium MET values for sedentary and moderate activities, but were more varied for high intensity activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Since the ratio of activity energy expenditure to adjusted RMR in children appears to be similar or slightly less, the adjusted compendium MET values may be used to approximate energy cost of activities in children and adolescents. If possible, MET values derived from studies in children should be used. Efforts are underway to publish a compendium of MET values for physical activities for youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Predictors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The energy cost of physical activity is affected by age, size, level of training, ethnic background, and the presence or absence of obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-energy-requirements-in-adolescents/abstract/8,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obese individuals have higher energy expenditure than do their lean counterparts in absolute terms.

Two cups of fruit and 2.5 cups of vegetables per day are recommended for a reference 2000-calorie intake, with higher or lower amounts depending on the calorie level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables each day. In particular, select from all five vegetable subgroups (dark green, orange, legumes, starchy vegetables, and other vegetables) several times a week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children and adolescents, consume whole-grain products often; at least half the grains should be whole grains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children nine years of age and older should consume three cups per day of fat-free or low-fat milk or equivalent milk products.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fatty acids and less than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of cholesterol, and keep trans fatty acid consumption as low as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When selecting and preparing meat, poultry, dry beans, and milk or milk products, make choices that are lean, low-fat, or fat-free.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit intake of fats and oils high in saturated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trans fatty acids, and choose products low in such fats and oils.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children and adolescents 4 to 18 years of age, keep total fat intake between 25 to 35 percent of calories, with most fats coming from sources of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains often.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose and prepare foods and beverages with little added sugars or caloric sweeteners.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consume less than 2300 mg (approximately 1 tsp of salt) of sodium per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose and prepare foods with little salt.

The basal metabolic rate (BMR) relative to weight increases from birth to two years, and then gradually declines through adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76918\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76918 \">figure 1</a>). The energy cost of growth peaks at the time of maximum growth velocity in early adolescence. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Basal metabolism'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Energy cost of growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The energy expenditure of physical activity can be expressed as a multiple of BMR, and is determined by the time spent on an activity and the intensity of effort. Energy expenditure also varies with age, size, level of training, ethnic background, and the presence or absence of obesity; typical energy expenditure during some recreational activities is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52989 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Physical activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimated energy requirements of adolescents are based on their total energy expenditure and requirements for growth, taking into account habitual physical activity levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102339\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102339 \">table 2</a>). Although the recommendations allow for various levels of physical activity, the active or very active levels of physical activity are encouraged for all healthy children. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Total energy requirements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prediction equations provide estimates of the energy requirement for an individual, based on age, gender, height, weight, and physical activity level. For adolescents who are overweight or obese, a separate set of prediction equations provides estimates of the energy needs required for weight maintenance at a given level of physical activity. This estimate can be used to develop goals for energy intake and physical activity for weight management. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prediction equations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many adolescents receive a higher proportion of energy from fat <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> added sugar, and have a lower intake of several micronutrients than is recommended. Key dietary recommendations for children and adolescents are to keep total fat intake between 25 to 35 percent of calories (with most fats as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids); emphasize fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; and to limit foods and beverages with added sugars. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Recommended composition of dietary energy intake'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">CDC Growth Charts: United States.
