Prior to the development of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> mesylate, interferon was the non-transplant treatment of choice for most patients with CML. However, with the development of TKIs and the increased toxicity of interferon compared with TKIs, this latter drug has been used much less commonly for the treatment of CML.</p><p>The use of interferon alfa in the treatment of CML will be discussed here. Other treatment options are discussed separately.

Although the degree of cytogenetic response can improve over time, it is uncommon to observe cytogenetic responses with further treatment if no reductions in the percent of Philadelphia chromosome metaphases have been seen during the first year of treatment.</p><p>In occasional patients, cytogenetic remissions were sustained for long periods of time, and in those patients with major cytogenetic responses, survival appeared to be improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Because of the considerable side effects from interferon, many clinicians chose to stop interferon therapy if cytogenetic improvement had not been seen after approximately one year of treatment. In two studies, 10-year survival ranged from 72 to 78 percent in patients achieving complete cytogenetic response to IFNa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The majority of patients who achieve complete cytogenetic remission following treatment with IFNa still have molecular evidence of disease when assessed by the more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/4,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-10</a>], although there have been occasional patients in long term cytogenetic response who have not relapsed after cessation of the interferon. In part because of this observation, there are ongoing or planned clinical trials that administer IFNa late in the treatment course as a means of increasing the depth of response so as to permit discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in a higher fraction of patients.</p><p>The initially recommended daily dose of IFNa-2a was 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day SQ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Many patients cannot tolerate this dose and insist upon its discontinuation. One group has documented a similar rate of cytogenetic responses at a lower dose of 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily for one month, followed by administration three times per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This result was confirmed in three randomized trials in which a lower dose (3 million <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> five times per week) was equally effective, and better tolerated, than the higher dose (5 million <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> seven days per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>A number of large randomized trials have confirmed the superiority of IFNa over chemotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> in terms of overall survival and cytogenetic response rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. These results clearly confirm the beneficial effects of IFNa treatment for the subset of responding patients with CML.</p><p>Because tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) use is contraindicated during pregnancy, IFNa is also occasionally used for female patients on TKIs who either desire to have children or who inadvertently become pregnant. There is very limited information about how effectively IFNa substitutes for TKIs in this situation and close monitoring is advisable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IFNa therapy is associated with significant toxicities. These include fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms in the majority of treated patients. Typically, the drug is started at a relatively low dose of approximately 2 to 3 x 10<sup>6</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> SQ three days per week. Conversion to daily treatment, followed by dose escalation is often better tolerated over time. Although the fever and flu-like symptoms generally resolve after a few weeks, chronic fatigue, sometimes accompanied by mild to moderate cognitive and memory disturbances are not uncommon. Toxicities also tend to be greater in older patients. Many patients prefer to take IFNa injections at night along with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> to minimize some of these side effects.</p><p>Longer term treatment with IFNa has also been associated with a number of immune-mediated and unusual complications such as hypothyroidism (2 percent), immune-mediated hemolysis (1 percent), and connective tissue diseases (2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other more rare &quot;occurrences&quot; include heart failure, porphyria cutanea tarda, membranous glomerulonephritis, vitiligo, and thrombotic microangiopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Switching to imatinib in long-term responders'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison to transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have not been any prospective clinical trials comparing IFNa to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). A retrospective analysis has been performed comparing the results obtained in 548 allogeneic transplants submitted to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] to those obtained with IFNa or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> in the randomized trial of the German CML study group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The following results were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As expected, there was a higher mortality in the transplant group for the first 18 months (relative risk [RR] 5.9)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mortality was similar in the two groups between 18 and 56 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After 56 months, mortality was significantly lower in the transplant group (RR 0.16)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seven-year survival probability was higher in the transplant group (58 versus 32 percent)</p><p/><p>The overall survival advantage for transplantation became significant at 5.5 years. The survival advantage began earlier in patients transplanted within the first year of diagnosis and in patients with intermediate and high risk features as defined by the Sokal criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, although transplantation is associated with higher short-term mortality and can actually shorten survival in patients who succumb to its side effects, the overall long-term results of transplantation are superior, representing the only potentially curative approach for this disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Interferon plus cytarabine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to toxicity issues, the major problems with the use of IFNa are that improvement in overall survival may be restricted to those who are cytogenetic responders and that the time to best cytogenetic response can occur as late as one to many years after the onset of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. As a result, efforts have been aimed at increasing the percentage of cytogenetic responses. The combination of IFNa and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (Ara-C) increases cytogenetic responses in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], as well as in patients in stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] and advanced stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], thus setting the stage for trials involving these agents in combination. The results of two available randomized trials have been mixed:</p><p>In one study 721 patients with chronic phase CML were randomly assigned to receive either IFNa alone (5 x 10<sup>6</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">units/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day SQ) or IFNa plus Ara-C (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day SQ for 10 days each month) following attainment of complete hematologic remission with HU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The study was stopped early when significant improvements were noted in the IFNa plus Ara-C arm in overall survival (86 versus 79 percent at three years) and major cytogenetic responses at 12 months (41 versus 24 percent). Toxicity of the combined treatment was substantial and included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and mucositis. The major hematologic side effect was thrombocytopenia; however, no life threatening episodes of bleeding occurred.</p><p>In contrast, no benefit from adding Ara-C to interferon was observed in a similar cooperative group study from Italy, in which 538 patients with chronic phase CML were randomly assigned to receive interferon (3 to 6 million <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> SQ or IM) with or without Ara-C (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for the first 10 days of each month) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Attainment of complete hematologic response (62 versus 55 percent, respectively) and overall five-year survival (68 versus 65 percent, respectively) were similar in the two treatment arms; treatment did not affect survival within the low, intermediate, or high risk groups.</p><p>A pilot study using an oral form of Ara-C (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> ocfosfate, YNK01) plus interferon in previously untreated patients with CML reported major cytogenetic responses in seven of eight evaluable patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting) were common; diarrhea was severe in two patients and treatment-limiting in one of the two.</p><p>Similarly, use of two different polyethylene glycol formulations of IFNa (pegylated interferon), which allow once per week SQ dosing, along with low-dose Ara-C SQ was shown to be active in early studies, although there was significant dose-limiting toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison to imatinib</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Results of the randomized IRIS trial comparing interferon plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> mesylate in previously untreated patients with CML are discussed separately. The superior results with imatinib have made the use of IFNa much less common, due to fewer responses and greater toxicity with IFNa. The majority of patients who receive non-transplant therapies are treated with imatinib. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&quot;, section on 'Imatinib'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Interferon plus imatinib</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, have produced long term remissions in patients with CML and have become the standard therapy for patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase. However, TKIs do not appear to eliminate the CML stem cell and attempts to discontinue therapy have usually resulted in relapse. IFNa may be able to target these CML stem cells by stimulating cytotoxic T cells and there is interest in assessing whether the addition of interferon to imatinib, given either simultaneously or sequentially, might eventually permit successful discontinuation of imatinib in a higher fraction of patients in complete molecular response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. As such, retrospective and prospective studies have investigated the use of IFNa plus imatinib.</p><p>As an example, a retrospective analysis of 495 patients with CML in chronic phase reported that, when compared with patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> alone, patients treated with IFNa plus imatinib had a significantly higher rate of complete cytogenetic remission at six months (60 versus 42 percent), but similar rates at 48 months (88 versus 88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Another report of 20 patients enrolled in a prospective trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> plus IFNa who discontinued imatinib therapy reported that 15 patients remained in remission on IFN at a median follow-up time of 2.4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Ongoing prospective trials are investigating this combination therapy. The French SPIRIT trial demonstrated higher rates of molecular response using the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> and peg-interferon compared with interferon alone, although the cytogenetic response rates were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A very large randomized trial conducted in Germany failed to demonstrate an improvement in progression-free survival with the addition of interferon alfa to imatinib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In both trials, combination therapy resulted in an increased frequency and severity of hematologic and nonhematologic adverse events, necessitating dose reductions or discontinuation of interferon in many patients, and to date there has been no effect on survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. As such, additional data are necessary before this combination can be recommended outside of a clinical trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SWITCHING TO IMATINIB IN LONG-TERM RESPONDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little available information on long-term results in patients maintained on treatment with interferon after attaining a major or complete cytogenetic response. Of the 553 subjects randomly assigned to treatment with interferon plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> in the IRIS trial, only 16 patients (3 percent) were still taking this treatment after a median follow-up of 60 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>There are some data about the efficacy and safety of switching treatment to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> in patients who have achieved long-term responses to interferon. This issue was addressed in a phase II study of 23 patients with chronic phase CML who were maintained on single agent interferon for a median of 4.5 years (range 1.6 to 14 years) and then switched to treatment with imatinib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. All had achieved either complete (15 patients) or near-complete (8 patients) stable cytogenetic response for the previous six months before being switched to imatinib (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52082\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52082 \">table 1</a>). The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixteen of the 23 patients had not achieved a major molecular response (MMR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52082\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52082 \">table 1</a>) at the time treatment was switched. All achieved MMR at a median of three months after initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>.

All 21 continued in CCR at a median follow-up of 45 months. Hematologic toxicity of grade 3 or 4 was present in four patients and was reversible on dose adjustment. There were no deaths during the study or follow-up periods.</p><p/><p>Thus, switching these interferon-responsive patients to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> led to a rapid improvement in response, either from <span class=\"nowrap\">major/complete</span> cytogenetic response to major molecular remission or from major to complete molecular remission.

IFNa is no longer the preferred initial treatment for CML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because TKI use is contraindicated during pregnancy, IFNa is also occasionally used for female patients on TKIs who either desire to have children or who inadvertently become pregnant. There is very limited information about how effectively IFNa substitutes for TKIs in this situation and close monitoring is advisable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IFNa produces hematologic remissions in the majority of patients and complete cytogenetic remissions in a minority. Occasional patients have a cytogenetic remission sustained for long periods of time. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Interferon alfa'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with IFNa is associated with significant toxicities. Most patients develop fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms, which generally resolve after a few weeks. Potential long term side effects include chronic fatigue, mild to moderate cognitive and memory disturbances, and immune-mediated disorders. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interferon-alfa-for-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Talpaz M, McCredie KB, Mavligit GM, Gutterman JU.
