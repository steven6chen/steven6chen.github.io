It is one of several relatively uncommon headache syndromes that may occur either as a primary headache or as a headache caused by a potentially malignant processes. Careful evaluation for underlying causes is important for these uncommon types of headache.</p><p>This topic will review primary headache associated with sexual activity. Other types of uncommon primary headache disorders are discussed separately.

Benign sexual headaches are difficult to study because of their relative rarity and variable clinical presentation. One investigator proposed that preorgasmic headaches arise from excessive contraction of neck and jaw muscles during sexual activity and that they might be avoided by conscious relaxation of these muscles during intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Orgasmic headaches have been attributed to rapid increases in blood pressure and heart rate that occur during orgasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The occasional occurrence of transient neurologic symptoms such as numbness or paresthesias with sexual headaches has caused some authors to suggest that benign sexual headache should be considered a variant of migraine caused by hemodynamic shifts during orgasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Although many of the patients in reported case series of sexual headache also have a history of migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], the high prevalence of migraine might result in co-occurrence of the two disorders. Therefore, the attribution of sexual headache to migraine without rigorous investigation of potential underlying causes is probably unwise.</p><p>Several investigators have noted a possible relationship between sexual headache and exertional headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study of 45 patients with primary sexual headache found that 40 percent had also experienced primary exertional headache on at least one occasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Presumably, physical exertion associated with sexual activity can be one of the factors that precipitate exertional headache in those who are predisposed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exertional-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exertional headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H224084715\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary headache associated with sexual activity is rare, but its exact prevalence and incidence of primary sexual headache is unknown. One Danish population-based study found that the lifetime prevalence of sexual headache was 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In a case series from Germany of 51 patients with sexual headache, the mean age at onset was 35 years, and the male female ratio was 2.9:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In these patients with sexual headache, comorbid migraine, benign exertional headache, and tension-type headache were present in 25, 29, and 45 percent, respectively. Other reports indicate that headache associated with sexual activity can present at any sexually active age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache associated with sexual activity is bilateral in approximately two-thirds of patients and unilateral in one-third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In most patients, the localization is occipital or diffuse. The pain is variable in terms of onset (sudden or gradual), peak intensity (mild to severe), quality (pressure-like or throbbing), and duration (minutes to hours). There are no autonomic or vegetative symptoms in most cases. Sexual headaches are unpredictable and are not necessarily precipitated with every sexual encounter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. They can occur independent of the type of sexual activity, whether intercourse or masturbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Traditionally, headache associated with sexual activity has been divided into two types, preorgasmic and orgasmic, that were thought to have distinct clinical features: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preorgasmic headache</strong> is a dull, usually bioccipital pressure-like or aching pain that appears during sexual activity and increases with mounting sexual excitement. There is often an awareness of increased contraction in neck and jaw muscles. Preorgasmic headache accounts for less than a third of the benign sexual headaches reported in the literature. In one series of 21 patients, the sexual headaches persisted about 30 minutes on average with a range from 1 to 180 minutes, and the frequency of the headaches was related to that of orgasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Orgasmic headache</strong> has a sudden explosive onset followed by severe throbbing head pain that occurs just prior to or at the moment of orgasm. Orgasmic headache may rapidly generalize to involve the entire head.</p><p/><p>However, there is evidence that these subforms are not clearly distinguishable, suggesting that primary headache associated with sexual activity is a single entity with variable presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As an example, one retrospective study evaluated 51 patients with headache associated with sexual activity for whom other causes of headache were excluded and divided them into 11 patients with type 1 (dull subtype) and 40 patients with type 2 (explosive subtype) headache based upon a structured interview [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There were no statistically significant differences between these groups in unilateral pain, location of pain, throbbing pain, duration of severe pain, and duration of milder pain. The two subtypes differed only in time of onset; the median onset of the dull subtype was 150 seconds before orgasm, while the median onset of the explosive subtype was exactly with orgasm.</p><p>Of the two types of sexual headache, orgasmic headache is more common and the only one associated with stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/1,2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H224084783\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of primary headache associated with sexual activity is suspected when characteristic headache symptoms occur during sexual activity. The diagnosis always requires the exclusion of intracranial hemorrhage and structural causes with neuroimaging.</p><p>Excluding a structural cause is especially important when the headaches are of the abrupt explosive (&quot;orgasmic&quot;) type; it is mandatory to exclude intracranial bleed, arterial dissection, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes, cerebral venous thrombosis, and posterior fossa pathology at the first presentation of orgasmic headache (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). Orgasmic headache is particularly worrisome because of its similarity to the headache of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and because 4 to 12 percent of patients presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to an aneurysmal rupture cite sexual intercourse as the precipitating event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>The work-up to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage includes a head CT and lumbar puncture if the patient is within hours or a few days from headache onset. A negative head CT and lumbar puncture effectively eliminate the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage as long as both tests are performed within a few days of the event. A brain MRI with gadolinium and an MR angiogram, and sometimes a lumbar puncture are of more value if a longer time has elapsed since onset. The diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p>Neurovascular imaging with CT angiography, MR angiography, or conventional contrast angiography is necessary in most cases to exclude aneurysm and to exclude cervical and intracranial arterial dissection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Identifying the etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H95541778\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous cerebral and cervical artery dissection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to angiography, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can be useful to evaluate for reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes.</p><p>The combination of an abnormal signal in a venous sinus on brain MRI and the corresponding absence of flow on MR venography confirms the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis. CT venography is a useful alternative to MR venography for the diagnosis of CVT.

The following observations were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At baseline examination, single attacks or single bouts of sexual headache were reported by 75 percent, while a chronic course with ongoing headache was reported by 25 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with chronic course of sexual headache at baseline, the remission rate at three years was 69 percent</p><p/><p>Persistent neurologic deficits following sexual headaches have been rarely reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-headache-associated-with-sexual-activity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; any persistent deficit requires investigation to evaluate for stroke or other underlying cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1609466702\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-migraine-and-other-primary-headache-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Migraine and other primary headache disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of primary (benign) headache associated with sexual activity is unknown and the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms are largely speculative. (See <a href=\"#H224084660\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary headache associated with sexual activity is a rare type of headache that is more prevalent in males than in females. (See <a href=\"#H224084715\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache associated with sexual activity is bilateral in approximately two-thirds of patients and unilateral in one-third. In most patients, the localization is occipital or diffuse. The pain is variable in terms of onset, peak intensity, quality, and duration. Traditionally, two subforms were recognized:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preorgasmic headache is a dull, usually bioccipital pressure-like or aching pain that appears during sexual activity and increases with mounting sexual excitement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Orgasmic headache has a sudden explosive onset followed by severe throbbing head pain that occurs just prior to or at the moment of orgasm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, there is evidence that these subforms are not clearly distinguishable, suggesting that primary headache associated with sexual activity is a single entity with variable presentations. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of primary headache associated with sexual activity is suspected when headache symptoms occur during sexual activity. The diagnosis always requires that structural causes be excluded. For patients with new-onset or never-evaluated headache associated with sexual activity that have abrupt explosive intensity just before or with orgasm in some or all instances, we recommend brain imaging with CT or MRI, and lumbar puncture if brain imaging is unrevealing, to exclude intracranial hemorrhage; we also recommend neurovascular imaging to exclude aneurysm and dissection of cervical and intracranial arteries. For patients with new-onset or never-evaluated headache associated with sexual activity that is <strong>never</strong> associated with abrupt or explosive intensity, we suggest neuroimaging to exclude a structural brain lesion. A primary (ie, benign) headache syndrome is likely if no abnormality is identified despite a thorough evaluation for structural, vascular, or pharmacologic causes. (See <a href=\"#H224084783\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary considerations in the differential diagnosis of headache associated with sexual activity are subarachnoid hemorrhage, arterial dissection, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once underlying pathology has been excluded, treatment of benign sexual headache should be offered. In particular, a neurovascular lesion should be excluded before starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> or triptan therapy for sexual headache. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For acute therapy of primary headache associated with sexual activity that has abrupt explosive intensity (&quot;orgasmic&quot;), we suggest triptan treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Preferred agents are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> intranasal spray 20 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolmitriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolmitriptan</a> intranasal spray 5 mg. Empiric evidence suggests the response rate of acute orgasmic headache to triptans is about 50 percent. (See <a href=\"#H224084864\" class=\"local\">'Acute treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with predictable primary headache associated with sexual activity, we suggest initial preventive treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> (25 to 150 mg taken 30 to 60 minutes before sexual activity) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients refractory to or intolerant of indomethacin, or those with comorbid migraine headache, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> starting at 40 mg daily. For patients refractory to or intolerant of indomethacin and propranolol, we suggest preventive treatment with a triptan. Another alternative is the combination drug belladonna-phenobarbital-ergotamine tartrate (Bellergal).
