HFV is not a first-line mode of mechanical ventilation and is used rarely; its use should be coordinated by experienced clinicians only.</p><p>This topic review describes the different types of HFV, as well as patient selection, efficacy, and potential harms. Alternative modes of mechanical ventilation are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF HFV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four basic types of HFV: high frequency jet ventilation, high frequency oscillatory ventilation, high frequency percussive ventilation, and high frequency positive pressure ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54248 \">figure 1</a>). Among these high frequency oscillatory ventilation is the mode that is used most often. None of these modes are first line for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">High frequency jet ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) refers to HFV delivered using a jet of gas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54248 \">figure 1</a>). It is initiated by inserting into the lumen of the endotracheal tube a small (14 to 16 gauge) cannula, which is connected to a specialized ventilator. An initial pressure of approximately 35 pounds per square inch (psi) drives the jet of gas from the cannula with an initial respiratory rate of 100 to 150 breaths per minute and an inspiratory fraction less than 40 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59997\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59997 \">algorithm 1</a>). The inspiratory fraction is the inspiratory time divided by the sum of the inspiratory and expiratory times. Applied positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be added if needed.</p><p>An arterial blood gas should be measured approximately 15 minutes after the initiation of HFJV:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate adjustments when the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) is elevated include: increasing the driving pressure in 5 psi increments to a maximum of 50 psi, increasing the inspiratory fraction in 5 percent increments to a maximum of 40 percent, increasing the frequency in 10 breaths per minute increments to a maximum of 250 breaths per minute, or adding an another mode of mechanical ventilation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate adjustments when the PaCO<sub>2</sub> is low include: decreasing the driving pressure in 5 psi decrements, decreasing the inspiratory fraction in 5 percent decrements to a minimum of 20 percent, or decreasing the frequency in 10 breaths per minute decrements to a minimum of 100 breaths per minute</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate adjustments when the arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) is low include: adding applied PEEP in 3 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O increments, increasing the driving pressure by 5 psi increments to a maximum of 50 psi, or increasing the inspiratory fraction in 5 percent increments to a maximum of 40 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate adjustments when the PaO<sub>2</sub> is high include: decreasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) or decreasing applied PEEP</p><p/><p>A respiratory rate of approximately 150 breaths per minute is generally required during HFJV. Use of ultrahigh frequency jet ventilation (180 to 400 breaths per minute) in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported, although the study had numerous important limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. HFJV always requires sedation and usually requires pharmacologic paralysis also. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-neuromuscular-blocking-agents-in-critically-ill-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in critically ill patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">High frequency oscillatory ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) uses an oscillatory pump to deliver a respiratory rate of 3 to 15 Hertz (up to 900 breaths per minute) through the endotracheal tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54248 \">figure 1</a>). This rate is so fast that the airway pressure merely oscillates around a constant mean airway pressure. The respiratory rate (in Hertz) is set directly by the clinician. The mean airway pressure is set by adjusting the inspiratory flow rate and an expiratory back pressure valve (similar to applied PEEP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some pumps allow the mean airway pressure to be set directly.</p><p>The constant mean airway pressure maintains alveolar recruitment, avoids low end-expiratory pressures, and avoids high peak airway pressures. It also impacts oxygenation. Specifically, a higher mean airway pressure is associated with better oxygenation. HFOV induces a higher mean airway pressure than most volume-or pressure-controlled modes of mechanical ventilation.</p><p>The tidal volume (also called amplitude) is small during HFOV, usually less than or equal to the anatomic dead space. The amplitude depends on the endotracheal tube size and respiratory frequency: a smaller amplitude results when the endotracheal tube is small or the respiratory frequency is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>HFOV at a respiratory rate greater than 6 Hz may be required to reduce barotrauma because the usual respiratory rate of 3 to 6 Hz results in airway pressures that are potentially not lung protective. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by a single center, prospective cohort study of 30 patients with ARDS who were receiving HFOV after failing conventional lung protective ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Among patients whose respiratory rates exceeded 6 Hz (range 6 to 15 Hz), most were able to meet their oxygenation (PaO<sub>2</sub> 55 to 80 mmHg) and ventilatory goals (pH 7.25 to 7.35).</p><p>Tracheal gas insufflation (TGI) during HFOV may improve gas exchange. This was demonstrated by a single-center, randomized, cross-over trial of patients with early ARDS, in which TGI to a mean tracheal pressure 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O above mean airway pressure (Paw) increased the PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> ratio and decreased the PaCO<sub>2</sub> compared to HFOV alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Step-wise increases in the Paw may be superior to other techniques of lung volume recruitment during HFOV, according to one animal study. The study found that an incremental increase in the Paw over six minutes (until it was 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O greater than the Paw achieved with conventional mechanical ventilation) improved lung volume, oxygenation, and ventilation to a greater degree than other techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">High frequency percussive ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) combines HFV plus time cycled, pressure-limited controlled mechanical ventilation (ie, pressure control ventilation [PCV]). It can be conceptualized as HFOV oscillating around two different pressure levels, the inspiratory and expiratory airway pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. HFPV improves oxygenation, improves ventilation, and lowers airway pressures (peak, mean, and end-expiratory), compared to other modes of mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Pressure-limited ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>HFPV is possible because of a device called a phasitron. The phasitron is an inspiratory and expiratory valve located at the end of the endotracheal tube. High-pressure gas drives the phasitron to deliver small tidal volumes at a high frequency (200 to 900 beats per min), superimposed on the inspiratory and expiratory airway pressures of PCV. The PCV is typically delivered at a respiratory rate of 10 to 15 breaths per min.</p><p>HFPV does not require pharmacologic paralysis. In addition, it clears secretions more effectively than other types of HFV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">High frequency positive pressure ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV) is rarely used anymore, having been displaced by the types of HFV discussed above. HFPPV is delivered through the endotracheal tube using a conventional ventilator whose frequency is set near its upper limits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54248 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no universally accepted indications for HFV. Its use has been described in a variety of clinical situations, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchopleural fistula, inhalational injury, blunt trauma induced ARDS, and head injuries complicated by high intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ARDS &ndash; The theoretical benefit of using HFV in patients with ARDS relates to the small tidal volumes. A strategy of low tidal volume ventilation has been proven in randomized trials to improve mortality, possibly due to decreased alveolar distension and ventilator-associated lung injury. Although the trials did not use HFV, many clinicians suspect that HFV confers a similar benefit. Until this is proven, HFV should not be considered routine care for patients with ARDS. HFV is used by some clinicians when there is persistent hypoxemia during the first three days of mechanical ventilation despite maximal conventional therapy, although the data to support this are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventilator-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventilator-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe airway compromise and stridor &ndash; The use of transtracheal HFJV in the management of patients with severe airway compromise has been described as a less morbid alternative to operative tracheostomy. In one study, the transtracheal catheter was placed with relative ease (84 percent on the first attempt) and adequate ventilation was achieved in 96 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Only minor complications were reported, including kinking of the catheter, bleeding, and surgical emphysema. There was no increased morbidity and no mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchopleural fistula &ndash; HFJV is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for ventilating patients in whom a large and persistent bronchopleural fistula exists. However, the likelihood that HFJV will allow the bronchopleural fistula to close is unpredictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. While HFJV may promote fistula closure by limiting alveolar distension, this may be outweighed in some patients by increased plateau airway pressure (alveolar pressure), decreased oxygenation, or worse hypercapnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-bronchopleural-fistula-in-patients-on-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of bronchopleural fistula in patients on mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>HFV should be avoided in patients with obstructive lung disease. This is because the high respiratory rate used for HFV shortens the expiratory time, which can cause auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and related sequelae which can induce barotrauma in patients with obstructive lung disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&quot;, section on 'Auto (intrinsic) PEEP'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section describes the clinical evidence related to the different types of HFV. Generally speaking, there is evidence that high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and high frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) improve oxygenation, although neither has been shown conclusively to improve clinical outcomes (eg, mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or length of intensive care unit [ICU] stay).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">HF jet ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little moderate or high quality data evaluating the efficacy of high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) in adults. One trial randomly assigned a heterogeneous group of 309 patients with acute respiratory failure to receive HFJV or volume-limited mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There was no significant difference in mortality or the duration of ICU stay. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Volume-limited ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>In another trial, seven patients who were already receiving a traditional mode of mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure complicated by a bronchopleural fistula were randomly assigned to either switch to HFJV or continue their mode of ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There was no significant difference in the size of the chest tube leak (a measure of the bronchopleural fistula), but the HFJV group developed worse oxygenation and hypercapnia after switching to the HFJV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">HF oscillatory ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) have been performed in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>]. Despite evidence that HFOV improves oxygenation, it does not reduce, and may increase, in-hospital mortality compared with a ventilation strategy of low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure (ARDSNet strategy). Thus, we and others do not recommend HFOV as a routine ventilator strategy in patients with ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, it is not known whether HFOV would have a role as a last resort strategy for those patients with severe ARDS who cannot be maintained on an ARDSNet strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A number of studies and meta-analyses have examined whether HFOV reduces mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In the largest, multicenter trial, the OSCILLATE investigators randomly assigned adult patients with new-onset moderate-to-severe ARDS to HFOV or to an ARDSNet ventilation strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This well-designed study was terminated early after enrollment of 548 of a planned 1200 patients. The study was terminated for harm with an in-hospital mortality of 47 percent in the HFOV arm and 35 percent in the ARDSNet arm (relative risk of death with HFOV, 1.33; 95% CI 1.09-1.64; p = 0.005). Thus, HFOV can NOT be recommended as the initial treatment strategy for adult patients with ARDS. </p><p>The OSCAR trial, involving nearly 800 patients in the United Kingdom, also failed to demonstrate a mortality benefit at 30 days although the detrimental effect of HFOV on mortality observed in the OSCILLATE trial above was not in evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The results of the OSCILLATE and OSCAR trials differ from both a Cochrane analysis of eight randomized trials (419 patients), and a meta-analysis of six randomized trials (365 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,28</a>]. Neither analysis included OSCILLATE. Both meta-analyses of adults with ARDS who received HFOV had significantly lower hospital mortality or 30-day mortality than those who received conventional mechanical ventilation alone (39 versus 49 percent, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,28</a>]. A limitation of these meta-analyses was that some of the trials that were included did not use low tidal volume ventilation in their control groups, which could bias the results in favor of HFOV. When trials that allowed tidal volumes &ge;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> were excluded and the meta-analysis repeated, there was a trend toward lower mortality among patients who received HFOV (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44-1.03). These results indicate that the repeat meta-analysis was too small to exclude or confirm a clinically important effect and additional trials are necessary to compare the effects of HFOV and low tidal volume ventilation on mortality. In contrast, two meta-analyses of six and seven randomized trials, respectively that did include OSCILLATE and OSCAR confirmed no mortality benefit with HFOV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25</a>], while another meta-analysis of four trials (that included OSCILLATE and OSCAR) reported increased mortality in those with mild to moderate ARDS and possibly decreased mortality in those with severe ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>It was hypothesized that an explanation for a lack of mortality benefit to HFOV might come from the duration of conventional mechanical ventilation prior to HFOV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, a meta-analysis of nine studies (two randomized trials and seven observational studies) found no such relationship, even after confounding variables were considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Only the oxygenation index was independently associated with mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia&quot;, section on 'Oxygenation index'</a>.)</p><p>The effects of HFOV combined with another intervention have also been evaluated. Generally speaking, HFOV improves oxygenation when combined with inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitric oxide</a> or recruitment maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. It may also prevent worsening of hypoxemia when a patient returns to the supine position following prone ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. None of these combinations have been shown to improve important clinical outcomes and all of the studies had significant methodologic limitations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">HF percussive ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) improves both oxygenation and ventilation without hemodynamic instability or clinically evident pulmonary barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/8,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,33,34</a>].

There were no differences in ventilator-free days or mortality, and there was less need for rescue ventilation in the HFPV group (6 versus 29 percent).

The high respiratory rate shortens the expiratory time, potentially causing auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and dynamic hyperinflation. The plateau airway pressure (alveolar pressure) and mean airway pressure are likely to increase if auto-PEEP and dynamic hyperinflation develop, elevating the risk of pulmonary barotrauma and hemodynamic instability. This occurs despite a lower peak airway pressure conferred by the smaller tidal volumes. In many trials, the risk of pulmonary barotrauma or hemodynamic instability was the same for patients receiving HFV compared to those receiving an alternative mode of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-frequency-ventilation-in-adults/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite evidence that HFOV improves oxygenation, it does not reduce, and may increase, in-hospital mortality in adult patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared with a ventilation strategy of low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure. Thus, HFOV is not recommended as a routine ventilatory strategy in patients with ARDS. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'HF oscillatory ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HPFV also appears to improve oxygenation, although evidence that it improves clinical outcomes (eg, mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or length of intensive care unit [ICU] stay) is lacking. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HFV is not risk free. Potential harms include intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP), dynamic hyperinflation, and related sequelae (eg, pulmonary barotrauma, hemodynamic instability). In addition, there are specific risks associated with each type of HFV.
