Fasting and pre-meal glucose values remain very variable. Fasting glucose values range from 77 to 197 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.3 to 10.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> but are mostly in the mid-100s. Values before dinner are still often low, in the 40s and 50s, but are in the low to mid-100s on other days. He has reactions in the late afternoon while still at work but now only once a week. He notes some problem with short-term memory but is still able to balance his checkbook and function at work.</p><p>The tests for islet cell antibodies return strongly positive. The anti-GAD antibody level is 0.645, and the anti-IA2 antibody level is 2.132 (reference value is &lt;0.1 for each test). You change the diagnosis to latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).

The doses are adjusted at each visit in response to the patient's history and glucose diary. You stop <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> because oral insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or glinides) are not indicated in patients who are treated with insulin. After several more visits, the patient is well controlled on the following doses: NPH insulin 12 units before breakfast and 22 units at 10 PM and lispro insulin 5 to 6 units before breakfast and 6 to 10 units before supper. He adjusts his pre-meal doses based on the pre-meal blood glucose level and the estimated carbohydrate content of the meal. An approach to estimating the dose of short- and very-short-acting insulins can be found elsewhere.
