PMPS is a type of neuropathic pain, a complex chronic pain state that is typically associated with nerve fiber injury.

The characteristics include classic features of neuropathic pain such as burning, tingling, shooting, stinging, or stabbing pains, and hyperesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22804934\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is caused by direct nerve injury (eg, severance, compression, ischemia, stretching, and retraction) during the breast cancer operation or from subsequent formation of a traumatic neuroma or scar tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/5,6,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,12-15</a>].

Breast cancer operations can damage the brachial plexus, intercostobrachial, lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal, long thoracic, and medial and lateral pectoral nerves that innervate the breast, chest wall, and ipsilateral extremity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54961\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54961 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63143\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63143 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78501\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78501 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]. In particular, surgical procedures in the upper outer quadrant of the breast and axilla, where major nerves traverse the operative field, are particularly vulnerable to nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In addition, local radiation treatments and neurotoxic systemic therapy (eg, taxanes, platinum agents, vinca alkaloids) may also exacerbate PMPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/6-8,14,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,14,17,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22804946\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall incidence of nerve injury or impairment and resultant chronic pain following a breast cancer operation ranges from 20 to 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/1,4,6,13,17,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6,13,17,19-23</a>]. This variation can be partly explained by discrepancies in terms of definitions used to ascertain postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), timing of assessment, or age group of the population studied. The prevalence also depends, in part, on the extensiveness of the breast and axillary procedure performed. </p><p>In addition, the wide variation may also be due to a lack of a standard definition of PMPS, including type, site, and duration of symptoms (eg, chest wall versus ipsilateral arm pain; pain versus paresthesias), as well as the inclusion of patients undergoing immediate or delayed breast reconstructive procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19710037\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of persistent pain after mastectomy is not clear, although it is likely multifactorial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/19,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24,25</a>]. Pain is a subjective, multidimensional, and complex phenomenon whose different physiological, sensory, behavioral, sociocultural, affective, and cognitive components interact to determine pain perception and expression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain#H185828296\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy by type of pain'</a>.)</p><p>Based upon retrospective and prospective studies, the most common variables associated with a higher risk of developing postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/8,10,17,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,17,26</a>]: </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41151524\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients more likely to develop severe acute postoperative pain include those with preoperative anxiety and age &le;49 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Severe acute postoperative pain is a risk factor for developing chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/17,18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,24</a>]. In a multivariate analysis of 509 breast cancer patients, patients with severe acute postoperative pain were significantly more likely to develop chronic pain in the ipsilateral arm compared with patients with less intense postoperative pain (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with severe pain were also more likely to develop chronic pain in the breast (chest wall) area (OR 1.59, 1.28-1.97). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41151547\"><span class=\"h2\">Age at diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is hypothesized that younger patients are more sensitive to nerve damage, are less likely to tolerate pain, and have increased anxiety, leading to more reports of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. However, the effect of age on chronic pain development is poorly understood. Aggressive treatments, including surgery and adjuvant therapies, are more commonly offered to younger women, which may influence the prevalence of chronic pain following breast cancer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Other possible explanations include: age-related decrease in pain perception and increased nerve sensitivity in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Direct comparisons of studies are constrained by varying definitions of &quot;younger age&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/17,22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41151571\"><span class=\"h2\">Axillary radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuropathic pain is a side effect of radiation therapy, frequently identified in patients undergoing postoperative <span class=\"nowrap\">breast/axillary</span> radiation treatments, and occurring months to years after administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/6-8,14,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,14,17,18</a>]. In one series, postoperative radiotherapy and neurotoxic chemotherapy, in conjunction with an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), were felt to contribute to chronic pain that developed in 21 of 30 patients (70 percent) who were pain free for several months after the operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>The following retrospective studies illustrate the effect of postoperative radiation treatments on chronic pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a multivariate analysis of 509 patients, radiation treatments to the breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> axilla were associated with increased risk of chronic pain compared with postoperative patients not receiving radiation therapy (OR 2.18, 1.38-3.43 and OR 2.29, 1.47-3.58, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a survey of 569 women undergoing breast cancer procedures, more stage I patients treated with breast conservation therapy (partial mastectomy, axillary node dissection, radiation therapy) had developed chronic pain in the breast scar compared with women undergoing a modified radical mastectomy (total mastectomy with axillary dissection) without radiation treatments (45 versus 32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Women undergoing breast conservation therapy also had more chronic ipsilateral arm pain (37 versus 28 percent), as well as paresthesias in the breast scar (46 versus 35 percent) and ipsilateral arm (51 versus 38 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41151590\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An axillary node dissection serves as a surrogate for nerve injury contributing to PMPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Intercostobrachial nerves (ICBN) enter the axilla and pass through the posteromedial border of the upper arm with considerable anatomic variability. Thus, the ICBN is vulnerable during axillary surgery. Patients undergoing a standard ALND frequently have chronic neuropathic symptoms, while a less extensive axillary surgery (ie, sentinel lymph node dissection [SLND]) is associated with less frequent chronic pain complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/5,14,17,18,22,24,26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,17,18,22,24,26,28</a>]. As an example, a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire survey of 317 breast cancer patients found that more women undergoing an ALND with breast surgery (n = 105) (ie, mastectomy or partial mastectomy) had chronic pain compared with women not undergoing an ALND (51 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Some patients not undergoing an ALND did undergo a SLND. </p><p>However, in a review of 611 patients, surgical treatment approach, such as partial mastectomy (n = 458) or total mastectomy, one (n = 420) or multiple breast procedures, were not associated with PMPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Surgical factors and complications, including reoperation, bilateral surgery, as well incidence of seroma, hematoma, cellulitis, or lymphedema, also did not appear to be significant contributors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although earlier reports suggested a link between immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) and PMPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/13,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,31</a>], later studies did not demonstrated a correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This may be due to more aggressive preemptive analgesic techniques including intra- and postoperative local anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, adoption of new implant-based techniques using acellular dermal matrices may contribute to lower rates of PMPS in the modern era of breast reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41151598\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent PMPS is increasingly associated with several psychosocial factors (eg, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, catastrophizing, somatization). In a cross-sectional cohort study of 611 patients who had a total or partial mastectomy more than six months prior to the telephone interview, 32.5 percent reported clinically relevant pain severity of &ge;3 out of 10 in the breast (34.3 percent), axilla (19.9 percent), side (8.6 percent), or arm (8.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In a cross-sectional study of the behavior and symptoms of 148 breast cancer survivors, multivariate analyses showed that total energy expenditure was associated with better general health and fewer depressive symptoms, while frequency of activity was linearly related to physical functioning, pain, general health, and depressive symptoms.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-local-therapies-in-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of local therapies in metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/infection</span> &ndash; Pain can accompany erythema in noninfectious breast disorders, such as postirradiation mastitis, superficial thrombophlebitis, or cellulitis and abscess. An abscess can also occur in the axilla following an axillary dissection. Infection as cause of postmastectomy breast pain typically occurs early in the postoperative course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonlactational-mastitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonlactational mastitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phantom breast pain or phantom sensations &ndash; Chronic pain or chronic sensations can develop as phantom symptoms following a total or partial mastectomy, similar to those that occur after a limb amputation. The postsurgical nonpainful sensations are called phantom breast sensations (PBS) while a painful sensation is called phantom breast pain (PBP). While the symptoms of PBP are similar to those of postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), subjectively patients with PBP report the persistence of sensations within their amputated breast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PBS includes all sensations that are experienced in the amputated breast, whereas PBP includes sensations so intense that they are experienced as pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. The prevalence of PBS and PBP ranges from 0 to 66 percent, with the wide range most likely attributed to differences in methodologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/4,10,14,35,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,14,35,42-44</a>]. PBS are characterized by a sensation of persistence of the removed breast after its removal. Phantom breast sensations are distinguishable from pain or other sensory disturbances in or around the scar. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PBP is characterized by disturbing and painful sensations in the area of the nipple alone or involving the entire breast or segment that was resected, and may persist for years after the operation. Etiology includes central nervous system sensitization and cortical reorganization, which are associated with nerve damage, and are considered to have a role in pain chronification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>]. The injury to neurons results in spontaneous and evoked hyperexcitability. Psychological factors have also been implicated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemical neuropathy &ndash; Chemotherapeutic agents (eg, taxanes, platinum based), heavy metals, and alcohol can produce peripheral neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Presentation includes a distal, symmetric distribution of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paresthesias. Electrodiagnostic testing and clinical presentation help establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy#H6425488\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Toxic'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphedema &ndash; Lymphedema can present as an insidious soft tissue enlargement of the hand and arm. It can occur as a result of injury from an axillary dissection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy or from obstruction of the lymphatic channels (eg, tumor cells, mass effect). Discomfort and the sensation of heaviness is the most common presenting symptom, rather than pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal disorders &ndash; Common musculoskeletal disorders, such as bursitis, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), tendonitis, or rotator cuff injury can present with shoulder pain and a limited range of motion. Diagnosis can be established based on the history, clinical examination, and radiographic imaging (eg, MRI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-shoulder-complaints\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with shoulder complaints&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical radiculopathy &ndash; Cervical radiculopathy can present with pain, paresthesias, numbness, or weakness of the shoulders, arms, or hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Onset of symptoms is most frequently acute when caused by a herniated nucleus pulposus, but may be more indolent when due to spondylosis. Imaging studies, electrodiagnostic studies, and the clinical presentation can help establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22470168\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY OF LIFE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quality of life (QoL) is a multidimensional term that includes the physical, social, and psychological well-being domains. For a cancer patient, the appearance of pain may represent a continuous memory of the treatment and the disease. Additionally, pain may be incorrectly viewed as a sign of recurrent cancer and cause considerable psychological distress and a poor quality of life, even in the absence of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-postmastectomy-pain-syndrome/abstract/6,9,14,18,22,24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,14,18,22,24,26</a>].
