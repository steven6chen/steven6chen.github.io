Characteristic features of PSP and its variants include vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, postural instability with unexplained falls, akinesia, and cognitive dysfunction. This topic will review specifically the clinical features and diagnosis of PSP. Management and prognosis are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes are discussed separately.

As a result of their pioneering work, some have referred to the disease as the Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome. Since that time, hundreds of additional cases have been recorded, and the disease is now a well-recognized atypical parkinsonian syndrome (or Parkinson-plus disorder). As originally described, PSP was characterized by progressive supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, gait disorder and postural instability, dysarthria, dysphagia, rigidity, and frontal cognitive disturbance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The consistent pathologic features of PSP consist of neuronal loss, globose neurofibrillary tangles, and gliosis mainly in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem, and to a lesser extent, the cerebral cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A set of diagnostic criteria for PSP was initially proposed in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and revised in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H90507700\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>PSP is now recognized to encompass several phenotypic variants. The classical phenotype is now referred to as Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS), and other common variants include PSP with progressive gait freezing (PSP-PGF), PSP with predominant parkinsonism (PSP-P), and PSP with predominant frontal presentation (PSP-F).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5944873\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PSP is the most common of the degenerative forms of atypical parkinsonism, with an estimated prevalence of 3 to 7 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p>Early studies found that the annual <strong>incidence</strong> rates of PSP ranged from 0.3 to 0.4 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. However, a study published in 1999 reported an annual incidence rate of 1.1 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. The greater incidence found in later studies may be a result of better case ascertainment due in part to increased recognition of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The annual incidence increases with age from 1.7 cases per 100,000 at ages 50 to 59 years to 14.7 per 100,000 at 80 to 89 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The true incidence may be higher still with the subsequent discovery of additional phenotypes. (See <a href=\"#H90508451\" class=\"local\">'Variant phenotypes'</a> below.)</p><p>The mean age of onset for PSP is approximately 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,15</a>], which is older than in idiopathic Parkinson disease. Virtually no cases of autopsy-confirmed PSP have been reported in patients younger than age 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The original clinical report noted a strong male predominance of approximately eight to one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, later reports have found no clear sex predominance in PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-24</a>].</p><p>In a series of 121 patients with probable PSP, there were no significant male-female differences for a variety of disease measures including age at onset, clinical characteristics, and disease duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90508640\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no proven risk factors for the development of PSP except age. Some studies have reported that education level or environmental exposures may be associated with increased risk, but the findings have been inconclusive.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An early case-control study found that patients with PSP (n = 50) were more likely than controls to have completed high school and college [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, a subsequent study from the same investigators with 113 patients found that lower levels of education were associated with an increased risk of PSP, whereas no history of elevated toxic exposure was detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cluster of PSP cases in northern France was linked to potential exposure to industrial waste, specifically phosphate and chromate ore [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Two small case series reported environmental exposure to organic solvents in 12 of 13 patients with PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter case-control study with 284 incident PSP cases reported that a greater number of years of drinking well water, but not chemical exposure, was significantly associated with PSP. They also found an inverse association with having a college degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective case-control study suggested that high exposure to significant life stressors may be associated with the development of PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>Further studies are needed to determine if environmental toxins play a role in the pathogenesis of PSP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H439178170\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although PSP is considered to be a sporadic disorder, some observations suggest that genetic susceptibility has a role:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a few reports of a positive family history of PSP and other types of parkinsonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. However, these are distinctly rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare mutations of the microtubule-associated protein tau gene (MAPT) may lead to inherited phenocopies of sporadic PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A genome-wide association study reported an increased risk of PSP for two independent variants of MAPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, the study found an increased risk associated with several additional genes (STX6, EIF2AK3, and MOBP), the significance of which is unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several studies have demonstrated an overrepresentation of the H1 haplotype and A0 allele of the MAPT in PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. This has implied biological plausibility, since the tau protein is abundant in the brains of subjects with PSP. However, the H1 haplotype is also more common in patients with Parkinson disease compared with controls, even though tau accumulation and aggregation is not a part of the pathological picture of Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Hence, the meaning of this finding still needs to be clarified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study reported that first-degree relatives of patients with PSP performed worse than normal controls on an idiopathic Parkinson disease test battery that evaluated motor function, olfaction, and mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The authors speculated that testing may detect an asymptomatic carrier state or risk for PSP, or a subclinical effect of a shared environmental exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5944880\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the most common &quot;classic&quot; phenotype of PSP, known as Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS), the most frequent initial feature is a disturbance of gait resulting in falls. Supranuclear ophthalmoparesis or ophthalmoplegia is the hallmark of PSP (hence the name of the disease). Dysarthria, dysphagia, pseudobulbar palsy, rigidity, bradykinesia, frontal cognitive abnormalities, and sleep disturbances are additional common clinical features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3595923\"><span class=\"h2\">Postural instability and falls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with classic PSP-RS have a stiff and broad-based gait, with a tendency to have their knees and trunk extended (as opposed to the flexed posture of idiopathic Parkinson disease), and arms slightly abducted. They demonstrate impulsivity, probably from the frontal lobe involvement, and hence tend to lurch and stagger. Step length is varied, as is base width. Instead of turning en bloc as seen in Parkinson disease, they tend to pivot quickly, further compromising their balance and indicating an inability to take protective measures. When they fall, it is usually backwards. Over the course of the illness, such falls can result in a spectrum of injuries that include bruises, lacerations, <span class=\"nowrap\">bone/skull</span> fractures, subdural hematomas, and sometimes death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. When postural instability and falls are the only features of the disease, an abnormal response to the postural reflex testing (pulling the patient gently but firmly by the shoulders from behind to see if he or she staggers backward uncontrollably) may be the only abnormality in a patient's examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H402970\"><span class=\"h2\">Oculomotor findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supranuclear ophthalmoparesis or ophthalmoplegia is the hallmark of PSP, but it may take as long as ten years to develop. The average is three to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This distinctive ocular finding is first noted as slowing of vertical saccades, followed by a limitation of saccadic range. Concomitant limitation of lateral gaze is often present but is less prominent. Pursuit movements of the eyes are slow, jerky, and hypometric with unstable fixation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The ophthalmoparesis is initially overcome by the oculocephalic (Doll&rsquo;s eyes) maneuver, but with disease progression and brainstem involvement, vestibuloocular reflexes may be lost.</p><p>Other oculomotor findings in PSP include saccadic intrusions into fixation (&quot;square wave jerks&quot;), loss of optokinetic nystagmus (particularly in the vertical direction), loss of convergence, blepharospasm, and eyelid-opening apraxia.</p><p>The combination of rare blinking, facial dystonia, and gaze abnormalities leads to the development of a classic facial expression of perpetual surprise or astonishment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Vertical gaze impairment commonly leads to problems with reading, spilling food while eating, and tripping while walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H402977\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bradykinesia with marked micrographia is a primary feature of parkinsonism in PSP. Rigidity in patients with PSP is usually more apparent in axial than limb muscles, especially the neck and upper trunk. It can be demonstrated on examination by resistance to passive movement of the neck.</p><p>Retrocollis was emphasized as an important physical finding in the original description of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but is now estimated to occur in less than 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In addition to the retrocollis, other types of dystonia include blepharospasm and more rarely limb or hemidystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Apraxia of eyelid opening can be mistaken for blepharospasm but is distinguished by the absence of forced closure of the eyes.</p><p>The face is stiff, immobile, and deeply furrowed (the look of surprise) due to dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. About one-third of patients with PSP develop pyramidal signs, including hyperreflexia and Babinski signs. Facial and jaw jerks are exaggerated. The tongue is tightly contracted and movements are slow. Spastic dysarthria, dysphonia, and dysphagia are profound in the middle to later stages of disease.</p><p>A few patients with PSP show a moderate response to dopaminergic agents in the early stages of disease, but most do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In some, the gait and balance problems actually worsen with levodopa. Other clinical features of PSP include stuttering and palilalia (the involuntary repetition of words or phrases).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H402984\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive and behavioral abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neuropsychological profile of PSP primarily involves frontal lobe dysfunction. The patients manifest impaired abstract thought, decreased verbal fluency, motor perseveration, and frontal behavioral disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The presence of early and severe frontal cognitive (executive) deficits is a common finding in PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Executive dysfunction may be the presenting symptom of PSP in some patients but is more characteristic of the later stages of the disease. In a cohort of 311 PSP patients, global cognition was impaired in approximately 57 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], while impairment for a single or multiple domains was observed in 40 percent each and frontal impairment was observed in 62 percent. Cognitive impairment was seen in the early stages in 50 percent. Ideomotor apraxia may be a rare manifestation of PSP, although it is more common and severe in patients with corticobasal degeneration, a PSP look-alike [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This could make differential diagnosis between the two very difficult. (See <a href=\"#H5944901\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Behavioral abnormalities are also common in patients with PSP. In a case series of 22 patients with PSP, the most common behavioral symptoms were apathy (91 percent), disinhibition (36 percent), dysphoria (18 percent), and anxiety (18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. One study of 188 patients with PSP demonstrated depression in 50 percent and anxiety in 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], while another study of 74 patients with PSP reported obsessive compulsive symptoms in 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Pseudobulbar palsy is another characteristic feature of PSP. Emotional incontinence is much less common than in other forms of pseudobulbar palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], but patients with PSP commonly manifest the characteristic hoarse groaning voice along with moaning. Speech perseveration and anomia, but not true aphasia, are usually observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H402991\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early or late insomnia and difficulties in maintaining sleep have all been reported in patients with PSP. Polysomnographic evaluation of 10 patients with moderate to severe PSP revealed marked sleep abnormalities, all with significant periods (two to six hours) of insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Marked rigidity may result in the inability to remain comfortable in bed, further contributing to the sleep complaints. A prospective case-control study found that circadian activity rhythms are disrupted in individuals with PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>In contrast, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is infrequently associated with PSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. This negative finding, similar to the case of preserved olfaction (see <a href=\"#H20105117\" class=\"local\">'Potential disease markers'</a> below) can be helpful in differentiating PSP, a tau disorder, from Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy, both of which are synucleinopathies and commonly demonstrate symptoms of RBD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90508451\"><span class=\"h2\">Variant phenotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence from pathologic studies suggests that there is a wide spectrum of clinical variability in PSP. In a 2017 systematic review of 261 patients with pathologically diagnosed PSP and 231 pathologically diagnosed disease controls, there was a high prevalence of PSP phenotypes other than Richardson syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, an earlier multicenter report of 100 pathologically-confirmed cases of PSP found that the Richardson syndrome accounted for only 24 percent of cases, while various other presentations accounted for the remainder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Many variants of PSP, with tau pathology at autopsy in a pattern that is typical of PSP, have considerable clinical overlap with other neurodegenerative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The recognized phenotypes of PSP included the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PSP with Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS)</strong>, the classic form of PSP, is characterized by early onset of postural instability and falls, supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, and cognitive dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Axial rigidity is more prominent than appendicular rigidity and retrocollis is often present. It makes up about 24 percent of PSP cases.</p><p/><p>The other phenotypes described are based on what features are early and predominant, but this distinction fades with the progression and development of other features. This scheme was developed to try and improve early diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PSP with predominant parkinsonism (PSP-P)</strong> is characterized by asymmetric onset of limb symptoms, including tremor, and a moderate initial therapeutic response to levodopa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].

Microscopic findings in PSP are distinctive and prominent. The most consistent sites of pathology are in the basal ganglia, particularly in the substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, cerebellum, and internal globus pallidus, in addition to the oculomotor complex, periaqueductal gray matter, superior colliculi, basis pontis, dentate nucleus, and prefrontal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Involvement of the cerebral cortex is also increasingly recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. PSP pathology has also been reported in the spinal cord, explaining the possible urinary disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>The histologic characteristics of PSP include neuronal loss, gliosis, and the presence of tau-positive filamentous inclusions in specific anatomic areas involving astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66637\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66637 \">picture 1</a>). Tau cytoplasmic inclusions in surviving neurons, known as globose neurofibrillary tangles, are classically described in PSP, but are not specific to PSP. Neurofibrillary tangles are found also in Alzheimer disease, postencephalitic parkinsonism, dementia pugilistica, and the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam. Tau-positive inclusions commonly seen in oligodendrocytes are called &quot;coiled bodies.&quot; When seen in astrocytes, the tau-positive inclusions are called &quot;tufted astrocytes&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Involvement of all three cell types makes PSP unique among the tauopathies.</p><p>Ultrastructurally, the neurofibrillary tangles of PSP are composed of single straight filaments, in contrast to the paired helical filaments that predominate in Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. In other neurodegenerative diseases with tau pathology, the tangles are flame-shaped; in PSP, they are predominantly of the globose (globular) type. Some reports have suggested a remarkable heterogeneity for PSP pathology, particularly with regard to the overlap between PSP and Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>] and PSP and corticobasal degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">101,102</a>].</p><p>The major structural element of the neurofibrillary tangles in PSP is an abnormally phosphorylated tau protein. Tau is a protein that is involved in axonal transport and stabilization of neuronal microtubules. It is thought that abnormal phosphorylation of tau interferes with microtubule function, impairs axonal transport, and leads to tau aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles. Normal brain tau contains six isoforms that are generated by the alternative splicing of a single tau gene on chromosome 17. Mutations in the microtubule associated protein (MAPT) tau gene have been associated with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis#H25814656\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'MAPT gene'</a>). Studies have emphasized that PSP shares degree of genotypic overlap with corticobasal degeneration, as both disorders are more frequently associated with homozygosity for the H1 tau haplotype (an association also seen in Parkinson disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>]. Furthermore, a genome wide association study (see <a href=\"#H439178170\" class=\"local\">'Genetic susceptibility'</a> above) confirmed that the risk of PSP is associated with two independent variants of the MAPT gene<em>,</em> one which influences MAPT brain expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, isoforms common to both PSP and corticobasal degeneration tauopathies are aggregates of the four-repeat (4R) microtubule-binding domains that occur because of splicing of exon 10, in contrast to other tau disorders, where the three-repeat (3R) form dominates in the aggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The normal ratio of 3R and 4R tau is approximately equal.</p><p>Neurochemical studies indicate that the degenerative process in PSP involves dopaminergic neurons that innervate the striatum, as well as cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons and efferent neurons, respectively, in the striatum and other basal ganglionic and brainstem nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>]. Postmortem studies of patients with PSP have demonstrated a marked reduction in striatal D2 receptors, whereas the striatal D1 receptors are relatively spared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>]. In the brainstem, degeneration of cholinergic neurons is observed in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, rostral interstitial nucleus of Cajal, the medial longitudinal fasciculus, superior colliculus, and the pedunculopontine nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>]. A reduction in the acetylcholine vesicular transporter potentially may differentiate PSP from other types of neurodegenerative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Glutamate is increased in the striatum, pallidum, nucleus accumbens, and occipital and temporal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. One postmortem study demonstrated a 50 to 60 percent reduction of the GABAergic basal ganglia output neurons, which may, in part, explain the poor response to dopaminergic therapy in most patients who have this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The observation that multiple neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine and acetylcholine, are affected in PSP suggests that PSP is not a primary &quot;neurotransmitter&quot; disease, but a disorder in which multiple subpopulations of neurons degenerate with neurotransmitter availability diminished as a secondary effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90507634\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PSP during life is based upon the clinical features. Suspicion for PSP is raised when new-onset neurologic, cognitive, or behavioral deficits progress in absence of other identifiable causes in a patient &ge;40 years of age. The core clinical features include early postural instability with falls, oculomotor deficits, especially vertical gaze palsy, <span class=\"nowrap\">akinesia/parkinsonism,</span> frontal lobe impairments, including speech and language problems and behavioral change, and lack of response to levodopa. However, early diagnosis is difficult as the disease varies quite a lot clinically. No laboratory or imaging studies are diagnostic.</p><p>Neuropathologic examination remains the gold standard for its definitive diagnosis.

The disorders that are the most difficult to differentiate from PSP are the other neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders such as idiopathic Parkinson disease, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies, as well as vascular parkinsonism. </p><p>Unsteady gait and freezing of gait appear early in the course of PSP-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) compared with Parkinson disease. The parkinsonism of PSP-RS differs from that of idiopathic Parkinson disease in ways other than the early falling. Resting tremor is rare in PSP and rigidity tends to be much more pronounced in the neck than the limbs. In contrast to the symptomatic benefit of levodopa in Parkinson disease, an absent, poor, or rapidly waning response to levodopa is a characteristic feature of PSP. In addition, the relative preservation of olfaction in PSP can help distinguish it from Parkinson disease, which is characterized by hyposmia early in the course. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Olfactory testing'</a>.)</p><p>The initial clinical presentation of PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P) may resemble idiopathic Parkinson disease, and the two disorders can be difficult to distinguish early on. However, with disease progression, symptoms such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia, autonomic dysfunction, and visual hallucinations are much less common in PSP-P, which can help distinguish it from Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Patients with corticobasal degeneration almost always present with asymmetric signs, whereas in PSP they are usually but not always symmetric. The development of cortical sensory features, ideomotor apraxia, myoclonus, severe dystonia, and increased latency of saccades, should suggest a diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration. Multiple system atrophy is considered in younger patients and in the presence of severe autonomic signs or cerebellar disturbances. Nevertheless, these disorders overlap enough that clinical differentiation may be difficult, especially in the early course of illness.</p><p>PSP and multiple system atrophy are the most likely causes of unexplained postural instability and falls occurring within the first year of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Instability and falls in multiple system atrophy are usually present when patients already exhibit autonomic disturbances, although this may not be the case in the striatonigral degeneration or parkinsonian form of multiple system atrophy, in which autonomic signs occur later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. Instability or falls may develop in patients with corticobasal degeneration in the first year, particularly when the first symptom affects a leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. However, falls may occur early in dementia with Lewy bodies, usually in association with significant cognitive disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In a case series of 58 patients diagnosed with PSP, evidence of a multi-infarct state by CT, MRI, or autopsy was found in 19 patients (33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. Other incorrect diagnoses that are often assigned to older adult patients who fall include vestibulopathy, myelopathy, basilar artery ischemia, cardiac syncope, and epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>].</p><p>Although supranuclear gaze palsy is a key feature in diagnosing PSP, it may occasionally be present in other disorders, such as dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer disease, idiopathic Parkinson disease, vascular parkinsonism, multiple system atrophy, prion disease (eg, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), Whipple disease, or corticobasal degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44,131,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,131,134</a>]. In PSP, the vertical supranuclear palsy precedes the development of the horizontal gaze palsy, but in corticobasal degeneration, ocular motor apraxia usually precedes the supranuclear gaze palsy, which usually affects both the horizontal and vertical gaze [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The saccades in corticobasal degeneration have increased latency but normal speed, and are similarly affected in the vertical and horizontal plane, whereas in multiple system atrophy, the saccades have normal speed and latency. Blink rate, diminished in idiopathic Parkinson disease and multiple system atrophy, is usually less impaired in PSP. In addition, the upward gaze palsy, which may be the first indication of an ocular motor abnormality, should be differentiated from the limitation of upward gaze observed in &quot;normal&quot; older adult patients, in whom saccades have normal speed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>A midbrain or third ventricular tumor could cause vertical gaze palsy, extensor truncal rigidity, and pyramidal symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incoordination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,135\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,135</a>]. A tumor of the pineal gland can produce the so-called Parinaud syndrome characterized by limited upgaze, sluggishly reactive and large pupils, and retraction nystagmus. </p><p>Because patients with PSP usually exhibit early frontal lobe cognitive disturbances and sometimes frank dementia, they can be confused with cortical dementias such as frontotemporal dementia or Alzheimer disease. Pseudobulbar palsy, especially early in the disease course, can be confused with depression and other psychiatric illnesses. In cases of PSP with rapidly progressive moderate to severe dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease might be suspected.</p><p>On rare occasions, patients who manifest classic features of PSP, including eye movement abnormalities, early falls, and parkinsonism, will be found to have the pathology of other disorders including multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, Alzheimer disease, and idiopathic Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-supranuclear-palsy-psp-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3886965422\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management and prognosis of PSP is discussed in detail separately.

PSP with predominant parkinsonism (PSP-P) is characterized by asymmetric onset of limb symptoms, tremor, and a moderate initial therapeutic response to levodopa.

Involvement of the cerebral cortex is also increasingly recognized.

(See <a href=\"#H5944894\" class=\"local\">'Pathology and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PSP during life is based upon the clinical features. Suspicion for PSP is raised when new-onset neurologic, cognitive, or behavioral deficits progress in absence of other identifiable cause in a patient &ge;40 years of age. The core clinical features include postural instability, oculomotor deficits, especially vertical gaze palsy, <span class=\"nowrap\">akinesia/parkinsonism,</span> and frontal lobe impairments, including speech and language problems and behavioral change. No laboratory or imaging studies are diagnostic. Neuropathologic examination remains the gold standard for its definitive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H90507634\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H90507700\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of PSP by common clinical symptoms and signs is listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53679\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53679 \">table 3</a>). The disorders that are the most difficult to differentiate from PSP are the other neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders such as idiopathic Parkinson disease, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies, as well as vascular parkinsonism.
