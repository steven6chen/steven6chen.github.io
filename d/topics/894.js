Anesthetic planning depends partially on the expected surgical approach to revascularization. CABG is typically performed via a midline sternotomy incision with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In selected patients, off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) without CPB may be accomplished via either a full sternotomy or a small anterior left thoracotomy incision, termed a minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) approach. </p><p>This topic will discuss anesthetic management of patients undergoing on-pump or off-pump CABG surgery. Preparations, initiation, and management of CPB are discussed in separate topics.

We also monitor degree of neuromuscular blockade with a peripheral nerve stimulator, urine output, and temperature at several sites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-management#H2310510389\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Management&quot;, section on 'Temperature'</a>.)</p><p>For most CABG cases, we use transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), processed electroencephalography (EEG), and point-of-care testing (POCT) of laboratory values. In high-risk patients for whom pacing, defibrillation, or cardioversion may be necessary prior to surgical exposure of the heart, <span class=\"nowrap\">defibrillator/pacing</span> pads should be placed prior to anesthetic induction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F115417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115417 \">figure 1</a>).

After endotracheal intubation, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> as well as airway pressure and volume measurements are continuously monitored. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both ECG leads II and V<sub>5</sub> are employed, with computerized ST-segment trending to facilitate optimal detection of myocardial ischemia, as in other patients with ischemic heart disease.

There is a low incidence of permanent ischemic complications (0.09 percent) with radial artery cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. If the cardiac surgical plan includes radial artery harvest, alternative sites such as the ulnar artery are also suitable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Despite concerns for hand ischemia or ulnar nerve injury (due to its proximity to the artery), complications rarely occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery/abstract/4,7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted before an emergency case, intra-arterial BP may be monitored at the tip of the balloon catheter in the descending thoracic aorta to avoid any delay in beginning surgery. Insertion of a peripheral intra-arterial catheter can be accomplished as soon as possible after induction of anesthesia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central venous catheter </strong>&ndash; A large-bore central venous catheter (CVC) is useful given the frequent need for infusion of vasoactive medications and the potential for high-volume administration of fluids or blood products. We insert an introducer sheath (eg, Cordis) that functions as a large-caliber CVC <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> as a means to place a PAC, even if insertion of a PAC is not initially planned. If the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable in the postbypass or postoperative period, the introducer sheath facilitates later insertion of a PAC without interruption of vasoactive infusions. Typically, we cannulate the internal jugular vein using ultrasound guidance for vein localization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113393\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef113393 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113394\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef113394 \">movie 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We typically insert the introducer sheath shortly after induction of general anesthesia if there is adequate peripheral IV access for use during induction. Insertion after induction avoids patient discomfort due to pain and Trendelenburg positioning, which might result in hypertension, tachycardia, difficulty breathing, and myocardial ischemia in an awake patient. However, in patients with difficult peripheral IV access, and those with cardiogenic shock or risk factors for hemodynamic instability during induction, we may insert the introducer sheath <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PAC before induction of general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In other institutions, the introducer and CVC or PAC are routinely placed before induction in order to expedite surgical care. During introducer sheath placement in an awake patient, small bolus doses of an anxiolytic agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> 1 to 4 mg) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 50 to 150 mcg) may be judiciously administered to reduce patient discomfort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary artery catheter</strong> &ndash; In selected patients, a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) may be inserted to provide dynamic information regarding pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), cardiac output (CO), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. Routine use is avoided in many centers because of absence of evidence for mortality benefit in cardiac surgical and other patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Insertion of a PAC rather than a CVC is reasonable in a patient with hemodynamic instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Also, PAC monitoring is often employed in patients with moderate to severe pulmonary artery hypertension, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (&lt;30 percent), severe coexisting pulmonary or kidney disease, or planned CABG in combination with valve repair or replacement (due to longer cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB] and aortic cross-clamp times that may result in increased potential for postbypass myocardial dysfunction). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Selection of the type of PAC to be inserted is based on institution-specific availability and preferences. We prefer a continuous cardiac output (CCO) catheter with continuous mixed venous oximetry (SVO<sub>2</sub>) capabilities to facilitate management in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the highest risk patients who have a greater likelihood of continued hemodynamic instability following surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transesophageal echocardiography</strong> &ndash; We employ transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to confirm preoperative cardiac diagnoses, monitor left and right ventricular function and filling, and detect new regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) (eg, hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis), which are highly suggestive of onset of myocardial ischemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104112\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104112 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F104113\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104113 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-surgery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

A Class 1 indication (&quot;should be performed&quot;) is present for patients undergoing CABG with concomitant valve surgery or those experiencing life-threatening hemodynamic disturbances. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Even if TEE is not used electively, rapid deployment may be needed to diagnose causes of acute, persistent, and life-threatening hemodynamic instability (ie, &quot;rescue&quot; TEE).
