Gender identity-affirming care, for those who desire, can include hormone therapy and affirming surgeries as well as other procedures such as hair removal or speech therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will use the term transgender in the broadest sense to include any person with incongruence between gender identity and external sexual anatomy at birth. The evaluation and management of transgender men are discussed here. The evaluation and management of transgender women, the primary care of the transgender adult, and gender nonconformity in children and adolescents are reviewed separately.

Specifically, they now suggest that decisions regarding social transition for prepubertal youth be made in conjunction with a mental health or similarly experienced professional. They continue to recommend the management and monitoring of transgender adolescents, and adult men and women by a multidisciplinary team, as well as counseling patients about the time course of hormone-induced physical changes and options for fertility preservation.

Core components of the DSM-5 diagnosis of gender dysphoria include longstanding discomfort with the incongruence between gender identity and external sexual anatomy at birth along with interference with social, school, or other areas of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2395840128\"><span class=\"h1\">HORMONAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4223768816\"><span class=\"h2\">Transgender men (female-to-male, FTM)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3878565536\"><span class=\"h3\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual aim of transgender hormone therapy is to induce physical changes to match gender identity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The treatment goal is to maintain hormone levels in the normal physiological range for the target gender.</p><p>Historically, some transgender individuals self-medicated with hormones for a variety of reasons, including fear of rejection by health care providers, delays in initiation of hormone therapy, and the cost of undergoing treatment. Therefore, there should be careful assessment for self-medication, both past and current [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In transgender men, the goal is to stop menses and induce virilization, including a male pattern of sexual hair, male physical contours, and clitoral enlargement.

We suggest either testosterone esters (administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously) or testosterone gels, depending upon patient preference. However, higher testosterone levels are more easily achieved with parenteral therapy.</p><p>It is common to use 50 to 100 mg of testosterone enanthate or testosterone cypionate weekly or 200 mg every two weeks. Route of administration can be intramuscular or subcutaneous with similar effects. Although the subcutaneous route is not approved in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it appears to be effective and well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. With parenteral testosterone therapy, serum testosterone is typically measured midway between injections. However, some clinicians measure serum testosterone 24 hours after injection and again just before the subsequent injection. Some clinicians start with lower doses of testosterone because transgender men are often smaller than average men in size. The goal remains to achieve normal male levels and that can be done as quickly as practical.</p><p>Testosterone gel (1% or 1.6%, 2.5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> may also be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but virilization might be slower if lower serum testosterone concentrations are achieved than with testosterone injection. Some clinicians switch to gels once initial virilization is complete. This may help to avoid supraphysiologic testosterone concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, there is no evidence for an excess risk of endometrial cancer in transgender men receiving androgen therapy. In one trial of 35 transgender men receiving testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg every 12 weeks for one year, mean endometrial thickness (on pelvic ultrasound) decreased from 9.9 to 5.7 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Serum testosterone concentrations should be maintained in the physiologic range for men; endocrine monitoring should include serum testosterone and estradiol measurements, with goals of maintaining serum concentrations approximately 400 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (13.9 to 27.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> and &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (184 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L),</span> respectively.

Individuals taking testosterone gels should have similar targets, but the serum testosterone levels achieved tend to be at the lower end of the normal range.</p><p>In addition to monitoring weight and blood pressure, other lab testing should include a hematocrit because erythrocytosis is a common adverse effect of testosterone administration, particularly with testosterone ester injections.

Briefly, transgender men who have undergone mastectomy do not require mammograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, if mastectomy is delayed or not performed, mammography should be performed as for natal females.

In addition, the patient should continue to work closely with the supporting medical and mental health providers as appropriate.</p><p>The most commonly desired surgery for transgender men is chest reconstruction surgery (breast reduction). Note that surgeons experienced with this surgery for men should be sought out (similar to men with gynecomastia in general). For some transgender men, an oophorectomy, hysterectomy, and vaginectomy may be performed after one to two years of androgen therapy, although practice patterns vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Genital reconstruction procedures are best performed in the few centers with specialized expertise.

One option is creation of a neopenis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31</a>]. In other cases, a metaidoioplasty may be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transgender-men-evaluation-and-management/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. With this technique, the urethra is lengthened using an anterior vaginal wall flap to reach the tip of the phallic glans, and the clitoris is partially released and stretched by resection of the ventral chordae. From the labia majora, a scrotum can be constructed in which testicular prostheses can be implanted. This surgical intervention allows the patient to urinate standing.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

(See <a href=\"#H2605066997\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transgender individuals should have their gender incongruence diagnosed by medical professionals with appropriate experience. It is necessary to ascertain that there is persistent gender incongruence and that the person is able to understand the risks and benefits of intervention. (See <a href=\"#H3781355876\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before initiating transgender hormonal or surgical treatment, the clinician should counsel the patient about risks and benefits of the hormonal or surgical therapy, including impact on fertility, as well as realistic expectations about outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H2961289020\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For transgender men (female-to-male [FTM]), we suggest either testosterone esters (administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously) or testosterone gels, depending upon patient preference (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, higher testosterone levels are more easily achieved with parenteral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4129328570\" class=\"local\">'Androgen therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transgender men who have undergone mastectomy do not require mammograms. However, if mastectomy is delayed or not performed, mammography should be performed as for natal females. In addition, pap smears should be performed in transgender men who have cervical tissue present. (See <a href=\"#H404502146\" class=\"local\">'Routine monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that transgender men receiving testosterone therapy be monitored for erythrocytosis and dyslipidemia, two potential consequences of androgen therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2265105513\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender confirmation (or affirmation) surgeries can be considered after living one year in the desired gender role and after one year of continuous hormone therapy (unless there a medical contraindication to hormone therapy). This criterion applies to genital surgeries but <strong>not</strong> to other procedures such as chest reconstruction. Details of surgery are described above.
