This is most commonly due to obstruction of the epicardial coronary arteries due to atherosclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis&quot;</a>.) Patients are referred to as stable when symptoms, if present, are manageable with either medical or revascularization therapy.</p><p>Angina pectoris, or angina for short, occurs when myocardial oxygen demand exceeds oxygen supply; the clinical manifestation is often chest discomfort.

Since beta blockers reduce the heart rate-blood pressure product during exercise, the onset of angina or the ischemic threshold during exercise is delayed or avoided. All types of beta blockers appear to be equally effective in exertional angina. </p><p>In addition, beta blockers are the only antianginal drugs proven to prevent reinfarction and to improve survival in patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myocardial infarction: Role of beta blocker therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Beta blockers should <strong>not</strong> be used in patients with vasospastic or variant (Prinzmetal) angina. In such patients, they are ineffective and may increase the tendency to induce coronary vasospasm from unopposed alpha-receptor activity.

Short-acting dihydropyridines, especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>, should be avoided unless used in conjunction with a beta blocker in the management of SIHD because of evidence of an increase in mortality after a myocardial infarction and an increase in acute myocardial infarction in hypertensive patients.

This is based principally on the observation of survival benefit with beta blockers in patients with prior myocardial infarction or impaired left ventricular systolic function. Such a benefit has not been observed with calcium channel blockers.</p><p>Addition of a second drug (usually either a calcium channel blocker or a nitrate) is indicated if angina persists with monotherapy. The efficacy of combination therapy was illustrated in a study that randomly assigned 397 patients to four weeks of monotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=felodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">felodipine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> or a combination of felodipine and metoprolol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In addition, elderly patients who have SIHD have more severe disease than younger subjects.</p><p>The approach to the management of angina in older adults should not differ substantially from that advocated for younger patients. However, diagnostic testing and both medical and interventional therapy have been underutilized in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. This occurs for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elderly patients with coronary heart disease often present with atypical symptoms, including exertional dyspnea. Silent myocardial ischemia is also common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of therapies for coronary heart disease in older adults is often unrecognized or underestimated, in part because older adults are usually underrepresented in randomized controlled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of comorbid conditions and difficulties managing medications in older adults also complicate care.</p><p/><p>All of the drugs used in younger patients for the control of anginal symptoms are appropriate for older adults. However, older adults may experience more side effects, particularly hypotension from nitrates and calcium channel blockers and central nervous system effects from beta blockers. Elderly patients may need to be started on lower doses initially and should be monitored carefully for side effects.</p><p>While older adults have been underrepresented in clinical trials, there are sufficient data that medical and revascularization therapies are effective in older adults. The decision whether to continue with optimal medical therapy or perform revascularization requires the elderly patient's understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and a respect by the healthcare delivery team of that patient's subsequent preferences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic stable angina require follow-up on a regular basis. We suggest follow-up every 6 to 12 months. At each visit, a detailed history should be obtained and physical examination performed. In particular, it is important to establish: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A change in physical activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any change in the frequency, severity, or pattern of angina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tolerance of and compliance with the medical program</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modification of risk factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The development of new or worsened comorbid illnesses</p><p/><p>In addition to laboratory studies such as blood glucose or a lipid profile, an electrocardiogram should be obtained if medications are altered or if the history or physical examination have changed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H353099932\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations made in this topic, including those for follow-up, are consistent with those made in the 2013 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of stable coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2349282819\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The following is a summary of the strategy to achieve these goals:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease is suspected but not previously secured should undergo a complete history and physical examination and receive a 12 lead electrocardiogram. Most patients should undergo some form of stress testing to either secure the diagnosis or evaluate its severity. (See <a href=\"#H94289504\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers are preferred for initial treatment of symptoms. Calcium channel blockers and nitrates are used routinely to relieve symptoms when initial treatment with beta blockers is not successful or if beta blockers are contraindicated or cause side effects. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ranolazine</a> has been used successfully to improve anginal symptoms in patients who have not been successfully treated with nitrates, beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers. Regular exercise may reduce anginal symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Antianginal therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapies known to reduce the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events such as death and myocardial infarction should be started. These include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, statin, smoking cessation, control of blood pressure and excess weight, and optimal management of diabetes. Regular exercise and stress reduction are also recommended. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Preventive therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal management of these patients also requires periodic evaluation of the patient's clinical status, using the history, physical examination, and on occasion the electrocardiogram.
